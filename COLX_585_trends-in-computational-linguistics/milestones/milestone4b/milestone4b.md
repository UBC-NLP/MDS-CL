# COLX 585 - Trends in CL | Milestone 4-b (Final Project)
---

## Introduction

Your Final Project involves submitting your (1) code and data and (2) your final written report.

---
## Repo, Storage, and Code
rubric={mechanics:7}

* Make sure you ``follow the instructions from Milestone 1``, in terms of location of your files in the repo, use of branches, etc. 
* ``Submit your code and dataset used``. If you have used pre-existing data, just provide the URL/link (no need to provide the dataset itself). If you have crawled/prepared your own dataset, and it is particulalrly large (e.g., > 100K tweets), just provide a small sample (e.g., 1K data points). If you have annotated any data, please provide the whole annotated dataset along with the labels in a suitable format (e.g., CSV file, Excel sheet, etc.). 
* In general, ``our goal is to make this part straightforward and easy for you``. So, if you feel something is particulalry hard, please do get in touch with Peter and we will find a suitable solution.

## Project Write-Up
rubric={reasoning:15,writing:3}

* Submit the final written report.

## What Sections Could be in my Final Project Report?

In general, you could include the following.
However, you have the freedom to customize your project sectioning as fits so long as you communicate your work clearly.
``As such, the sectioning and details below are intended as suggestions for you``.

* *``Abstract:``*  One or two paragraphs summarizing the work, its significance and novelty as compared to previous work conducted by other people (e.g., in published academic research or engineering reports by industry).

* *``Introduction:``*  Where the work is motivated, a gab in previous scholarship is identified,and a new method (or task, or application, etc.)  is overviewed.  A list of the contributions of the paper follow, and a summary of what the paper intends to do in terms of which section does what.

* *``Related Work:``*  Here you summarize earlier work thematically.  Your literature review should substantiate the task well (with old enough references, as appropriate), and list any novel work (up to 3 months ago, or even more recent if you desire).  You review the literature while highlighting how your work compares, thus further emphasizing the novelty and utility of your approach.

* *``Dataset(s):``*  Describe the dataset(s) clearly, including any relevant statistics, method of data building, acquisition, annotation, etc., as appropriate.

* *``Methods:``*  Clearly describe your methods, substantiating these within the deep learning framework.  You should describe the methods enough such that your work can be replicated without difficulty.  For example, you should describe clearly architectures of each network you use, including layers, regularization, activation and cost functions, number of epochs, etc.

* *``Experiments:``*  Here you list how you solve the problem, including comparing to appropriate baselines, the different settings of your experiments, and the host of experimental conditions you may be using.

* *``Results:``*  Provide your results in tables, accompanied with visualizations as appropriate, error analyses (if relevant), describing the results in the narrative and interpreting them. You should answer questions like “why you are acquiring these results and not higher or lower?” This can be a function of your data sizes, network architectures, experimental conditions (e.g., augmenting training data, pre-training word vectors).
* *``Conclusion:``*  Here you summarize your work, what you could achieve, the limitations, and possible future directions (e.g., what else you could do if you had an extra month).

## Prompt Completion

Make sure you submit your code, data, and written report by Sunday, April 26 by 6:00pm. Late submission will be penalized by 5% if receieved up to 12 hours after deadline, 10% if recieved by up to 24 hours, and will not be accepted after Monday 6:00pm.(Note that deadline has already been extended from original Friday April 24 deadline).

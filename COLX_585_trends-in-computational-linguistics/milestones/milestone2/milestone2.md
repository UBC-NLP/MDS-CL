## Project Progress Report
rubric={reasoning:5,writing:3}

The goal of your progress report is to ensure you are on track and are making progress toward your overall project. As such, and to keep this simple, discuss any feedback you have received on your proposal (milestone 1) with your group, use this to update the proposal, and then add details pertinent to the progress you have made this week. In essence Milestone 2 is built on top of Milestone 1.

The above will mean you can use the same sections as your proposal (as appropriate). But now expand each section with more details, and add a description of what you have achieved thus far. For example, you had an ``Introduction``, now you can expand it to describe the problem you are working on with more detail. Give examples, if suitable. Add clarity. Now write as if you are submitting a finished piece of work, not as a proposal. This means, you will not be saying things like: ``[W]e plan to do X and Y``, but ``[I]n this work, we do X and Y``. 

In short, think about your first Progress Report (this milestone) as the first draft of your final paper/project report. Your next Progress Report (milestone 3), will also follow the same spirits--it is a step further towards your final report. Just a draft. So, in summary, Progress Report 1 (milestone 2) is your first draft for the Final Report, and Progress Report 2 (milestone 3) is your second draft.

### We want to know things such as the following:

** Data: Have you found a dataset? What is it? What size, genre, etc.? Are you crawling data? How are you processing the data? Are you annotating data?

** Methods & Engineering: Tell us more about engineering? What progress have you made? Are your initial ideas about methods are intact? 

** Previous Works: Now expand that section a bit more. Perhaps add 2-3 more papers that are relevant. Read these papers and summarize what the authors are doing/did. Feel free to add a screenshot from a visualization, or a method architecture, etc. from a previous paper that you will follow, etc.

** Results: Have you started running any code? Any initial results at all?

** Challenges: Are there any challenges that you are starting to see that you did not anticipate? How are you going to meet your challenges? Why do you think this is a good way to meet these challenges?

#### For your reference, the below were the sections we suggested for the Project Proposal. You can use the same sections, just with more updates. But make sure you add a ``challenges`` section.


### *Introduction:* 
- Where you introduce the task/problem you will work on. This answers the question: ``What is the nature of the task?`` (e.g., sentiment analysis, machine translation, language generation, style transfer, etc.?). Please explain ``what the task entails`` (e.g., taking in as input a sequence of text from a source language and turning it into a sequence of sufficiently equivalent meaning in target language). 
### *Motivation and Contributions/Originality:*
- ``What is the motivation for pursuing this project?`` In other words, ``why is the project important``. This could be because this is a ``(relatively) new problem`` where you are using an existing method on (e.g., translating tweets where the language is noisy and doesn't usually obey `standard` rules). This could also be because the problem is ``timely`` (e.g., carrying out ``sentiment analysis on COVID-19`` data, given the negative impact of the pandemic). Further, this could be because the problem is ``socially motivated`` and/or ``remains unsolved`` (e.g., ``toxic`` and/or ``racist`` comments on social media, given their pervasively harmful impact).  
- What do you hope your ``contribution`` will be? Here, you could aim at providing a ``better system`` than what exists (e.g., more robust MT), an application on new data (possibly within a new domain) (e.g., ``tweet intent and topic detection on COVID-19 data``), a system that delivers insights on a new topic (e.g., ``scale and sentiment in tweets in different location as to COVID-19``), etc. 
### *Data:*
- What kind of ``data`` will you be using? ``Describe the corpus``: genre, size, language, style, etc. Do you have the data? Will you acquire the data? How? Where will you ``store`` your data? 
### *Engineering:*
- What ``computing infrastructure`` will you use? Personal computers? Google Colab? Google Cloud TPUs?
- What ``deep learning of NLP (DL-NLP)`` methods will you employ? For example, will you do ``text classification with BERT?``, ``MT with attention-based BiLSTMs``, ``language generation with transformers``, etc.? 
- ``Framework`` you will use. Note: You *must* use PyTorch. Identify any ``existing codebase`` you can start off with. Provide links.
### *Previous Works (minimal):*
- Refer to one or more projects that people have carried out that may be somewhat relevant to your project. This will later be expanded to some form of ``literature review``. For the sake of the proposal, this can be very brief. You are encouraged to refer to previous work here as a way to alert you to benefiting from existing projects. Provide links to any such projects.
### *Evaluation:*
- How will you ``evaluate`` your system? For example, if you are going to do MT, you could evaluate in ``BLEU``. For text classification, you can use ``accuracy`` and ``macro F1`` score. If your projects involves some interpretability, you could use ``visualization`` as a vehicle of deriving insights (and possibly some form of ``accuracy`` as approbriate).
### *Conclusion (optional):*
- You can have a very brief conclusion just summarizing the goal of the proposal. (2-3 sentences max).

### Writing:
* Again, pay attention to writing mechanics and use .md format.

## Prompt completion
rubric={raw:2}

You should finish everything discussed above by 6pm Saturday, April 4. You will get an automatic extension until Sunday, April 11 at 12/noon. (You don't need to ask for that extension. Please go ahead and use it if you need it). Submissions after Sunday, April 12 12/noon, will be penalized by 5% if receieved after 12/noon. Another 5% applies for each additional day, up to total assignment weight.

# COLX 585 - Trends in CL | Milestone 4-a (Project Presentation)
---
rubric={raw:5}

## Logistics
For this assignment, the requirement is to (1) prepare a few slides about your project, (2) submit these slides by Wed. April 22 at 9:00am to your group repo, and (3) do the actual presentation along with your team during the allocated [time](https://github.ubc.ca/MDS-CL-2019-20/COLX_585_trends_instructors/blob/master/milestones/milestone4a/cold_585_ppt-slots.md) for your group. (Note, the slots in the link are 10 mins each, but in actual exectuion, please plan to use only 9 mins to allow for 1 min transition between groups). 

## What needs to be in your slides?

You are free to organize your slides the way that your team see fits.
In general, your slides could include the following:

* *Motivation*: What is the overall goal of your project? What motivates your work? Why is it useful, important, relevant?

* *Definitions*: Do you need to define any concept(s) the audience may not be aware of? If so, provide conside definitions that fit withi one slide. (This may not apply to some projects). 

* *Previous Work*: List 3 related previous works. Say 1 sentence about each. The goal of this is to help you distinguish your work. In other words, why what you are doing is different from previous works? Are you proposing a new method? Is it an application of an eisting method to a new domain, dataset?, are you applying the same methods to the same domain or datasets, but have something else that is new or different?

* *Data*: Summarize the data you are using? What genre or domain? Did you collect it yourself? What is the size? Did you perform annotation? Anything about annotation process you want to add?

* *Methods*: What methods did you use? LSTMs? BERT?, something else? Just list the method you used without going into much detail, unless it is something we have not covered in class, in which case you can say 3 sentences about it.

* *Experiments & Results*: Did you run a set of experiments? What are these? What are the results you acquired? What do you think about these results? Did you expect them? Why? Why not?

* *Conclusion and Future Work*: In conclusion, you can summarize what you tried to do and the results you acquired. Did you reach any conclusions or arrive at new insights after performing this work? If you have 1 more month, what could you do as extensions of this project or to improve its outcomes? Do you want to say something nice about group members? Or does the team want to say something nice about their experience working together? (Remember, even if there were challenges, good teams usually learn from one another and there will be nice things that can be said and appreciated).

Again, please remember these organization is only a suggestion and it may be ideal for every single project.
We provide them here as a guide and to facilitate your work.

## How should we deliver the actual presentation?

Here are some general suggestions about how you should deliver your presentation:

* *Start Early*: Start preparing your slides early. Prepare a simple draft with even only slide titles and fill these in later. 

* *Work Together*: Every team member could help with 1-2 slides, but make sure you all agree and discuss together what makes a good presentation and how the transion between one slide another will be. Each team member can present the slides she/he prepared.

* *One Minute Per Slide*: Plan to have 6-7 slides. Allocate a maximum of one minute per slide. If you finish one minute earlier, that should be better than not being able to finish at all. *Time will be strictly enforced so that you all get to present and see other colleagues' work*. 

* *Simplify*: Even the most complicated work can be communicated in simple, high-level terms. Slides serve a different purpose than the actual research paper. Refer people to details in paper if they are interested, and say I will be happy to discuss details offline with those interested.

* *Clean Slides*: Do not include too much writing in your slides. The font should be readable from distance (even though we are doing this online, still a good idea since the goal is to train you on how to make presentations in general). Remove clutter from slides.

* *Visualization Could be Powerful*: Feel free to use visualizations if needed, but ok if not. Simple is good. 

* *Practice, Practice, Practice*: The rule is to practice delivering your presentation at least 3 times beforehand. Here, perhaps 2 times will be fine. Practie makes you confident and familiar with the content. 

* *Pace Yourself*: Use a clear voice, not very long sentences, be to the point and effective.

* *Take it Easy*: Don't spend too much time on your slides. The goal is to get the job done, easily but effectively. 

* *If You Present, You Get Almost Full Credit*: We recognize you and your team members have been working hard. We want you to continue to be successful. This assignment will be graded with a check mark. If you present, you will at least get 4 out of 5.  We expect all teams to get full credit on this assignment.

## Timing (Including Possible Q&A)
* Each group is allowed ``9 minutes``. You are free to use your time the way you like. Groups are encouraged to allow for 2 mins at the end to allow for Q & A and transitions. This will likely only allow for ``1 question``, which will be taken from the chat channel. If a group consumes all allocated time, there will *not* be time for questions allocated. Again, taking one question is encouraged. When you practice your presentation beforehand, one team member could mimic a questioner and another member would try to answer that question precisely (max 1 min). *Timing will be strictly enforced so that we do this efficiently*.

## Due date

You are required to present your project during the slot that will be assigned to you during the April 22 lecture on Zoom.
The lecture occurs at regular course time 9:00-10:30 and your slot will be 9 minutes during this time. See [here](https://github.ubc.ca/MDS-CL-2019-20/COLX_585_trends_instructors/blob/master/milestones/milestone4a/cold_585_ppt-slots.md) for your group slot. (Again, please note the slots in the link are 10 mins each, but in actual exectuion, please plan to use only 9 mins to allow for 1 min transition between groups).

rubric={raw:30}

## Introduction
The purpose of this *individual* report is to present your viewpoint as to how the project went and how the group worked together. You should write this as a separate markdown file. This is a *private* report, meaning that none of your classmates will see any part of it. You **must** do this report individually. 

``Honesty and objectivity are expected``, and should help you avoid running into major factual inconsistencies when we consider all viewpoints across the same team. 

Note that, short of someone not contributing at all to the project or a major instance of (unrepentant) disrespect towards a teammate, we are unlikely to give out final teamwork grades lower than a B-, meaning that provided your group has completed the other milestones, everyone should be on track to get a grade in the A range for the course. Primarily, this is an opportunity to prepare for the higher-stakes capstone projects by identifying areas which people need to work on to improve their teamwork skills. Please be upfront about relevant issues that came up during the project, and, on the flip side, also be prepared to accept constructive criticism in the feedback. 

There are three major areas that you need to address in your report:

---
## Contribution 

One of the expectations is that each person would have roughly similar contributions in terms of time. For each group member **including yourself** give a percentage score indicating how much of the total time your group collectively spent on the project was work from this person. You can give a range (but no more than 10%, please). Then enumerate the individual contributions of each member (a bulleted list is fine). If there were special circumstances that resulted in more or less time contribution by a particular member, please discuss. If you're unsure about exactly what someone else did or how long they spent on it, feel free to say so (you don't need to and in fact shouldn't contact each other to confirm).

| Group member name | Contribution (%)|
|-------------------|--------|
|                   |        |
|                   |        |
|                   |        |


## Communication	

One of the expectations of the project is that everyone should feel heard, in terms of major decisions relevant to the project, and kept in the loop about what is going on as things proceeded. Please rate your group members **including yourself** on the following scale (you can use half points if needed):

4. ``An superb communicator``. Forthright with ideas and opinions, but also actively soliciting others ideas, listening carefully and showing willingness to compromise order to build consensus. Goes out of their way to make sure everyone knows what they are doing, and encourages others to do so as well. Identifies teammates who are struggling with problems and proactively helps them, but in a way that isn't just taking over their work for them.
3. ``A solid communicator``. Expresses their opinion, and listens to others. Keeps others in the loop about what they are doing, and asks others how things are going. Gives helpful advice when asked.
2. ``A so-so commmunicator``. Usually expresses their opinion, but doesn't listen well to others. May forget to keep others in the loop, and will either ignore the problems of teammates, or instead try to take over their work or just tell them what do to.  
1. ``A poor communicator``. Disconnected from the group, won't express an opinion or engage with others in the group much at all. Obviously just wants to do their own thing.  

| Group member name | Communication rating |
|-------------------|--------|
|                   |        |
|                   |        |
|                   |        |

**Please justify your ratings for each member by providing specific examples**.

---
## Respect

The assumption is that everyone will be respectful to each other, and you may simply state in your report that you think everyone in the group felt respected. However, if you think there were instances of disrespect involving any two members of your group (including cases where you think you were the one being disrespectful; it's obviously better to be upfront about this if you can), please mention them here. You can also discuss why you think the event(s) happened, and what you think could be done to avoid them in the future. **We want to help you, so please use this as a moment of reflection.**

## Due date

The teamwork report should be completed by 6pm on April 28th. No late submissions are allowed for this assignment.

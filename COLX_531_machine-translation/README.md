# COLX 531 Neural Machine Translation

An introduction to machine translation, with a focus on neural methods. The course provides a brief history of MT, provides a brief coverage of statistical word-level MT, then delves into more recent neural machine translation (NMT) methods such as sequence-to-sequence models, attention, backtranslation, and multilingual modeling.

Upon completion of this course students will be able to:


* *become* aware of the history of MT and recent advances in NMT
* *identify* the core principles of training and designing NMT models
* *identify* main methods for evaluating MT models 
* *become* aware of the main datasets, tools, competitions in MT
* *apply* deep learning methods toMT problems in critical, creative, and novel ways

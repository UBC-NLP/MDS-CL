The place here is pretty big. Took two stars off because the service was terrible, not that I was expecting amazing service in chinatown and all the plates, cups were really dirty. Make sure to watch your bill too because they will charge you more than what you got. The food itself was decent: Singapore Mein Fun: was better than a lot of the places I have been too. I think I like this the most. The noodle was really flavor and not to spicy. Pork & Crab Dumpling: I think shanghai manner's soup dumpling is way better. The skin is really thick, but the soup dumpling was big. There isn't a lot of soup in the dumpling either. I probably would not get this here Spring Roll: Very oily and is not good. Taste frozen. Hot & Sour Soup: The flavor was really good, but they add weird stuff to it. Like pork blood and intestines.  Probably wouldn't come back because of how dirty the plates were. If you can't even wash your plates and cup, do you even clean anything in the kitchen?	2star
An amazing Thai restaurant with contemporary and traditional Thai cuisine. We even ordered food to our apartment and it was great. I advise going to the restaurant as it's beautifully decorated; I'll certainly be going back soon (especially once it's colder out).	5star
Before I ever made it to the City, I had heard quite a bit about this place from my friends who had lived here. They really talked it up and made it sound like the bees knees, so needless to say there were quite some expections riding on this place for me. Spoiler, this place lives up to the hype quite easily! I'll get my lone grievence of this place out of the way early on, and that's the price point. $25 is a bit much to spend on one meal, but no one can question the quality, variety, or richness of flavor you'll get from this meal! I regret not getting the lobster roll, and settled for the shrimp roll. While you don't get large pieces of shrimp per se, you still get numerous pieces, and the taste is complimented by a toasted butter roll, with a savory sauce as well. I did get a taste of the lobster with the bisque, and that was amazing and a meal in itself (definitely get the combo with the sandwhich). Overall, if you're in the city you should eat here without any hesitation. The price is a little high, but the quality and experience are just as high as well. To me, this was a classic New York lunch, and the only way it could have been better was if I were eating outside in Battery Park on a cool spring afternoon.	4star
"I got a 30% off coupon for Gardenia and the menu looked nice so figured I'd give it a try. Unfortunately though, this restaurant is using its location to charge prices that are obscene for what you get. We started with the crawfish tostadas and the mushroom and cheese flatbread. Both were very tasty, although surprisingly meager portions for appetizers priced in the mid-teens. Although the drinks we got with them were reasonably strong, there was a similar lack of value given how average they tasted. I got the cucumber margarita and one other drink I can't quite remember, but both were a resounding ""meh"". I think the point where I actively had an issue with the restaurant, though, was when the main course came out. I got bronzino (which is generally a pricey fish and no exception here), and had asked for it to be fileted, at the waiter's suggestion. However, when I received it it still had plenty of bones (a couple is ok but somebody clearly inexperienced had done it), and was barely seasoned. The potatoes that came with it were tasty but I didn't pay $30 for potatoes. Overall, we opted out of dessert and after two separate incidents of overcharging us on the check, finally got the correct bill of $150, in which they decided to charge tip automatically despite us only being a party of two. Weird. Either way, that was way too much to pay AFTER a 30% off coupon for just two people having dinner. The food isn't terrible but the value is - I'd recommend having dinner elsewhere."	2star
This is definitely a popular place as the huge crowd, line and all of these Yelp reviews will tell you.  The pizza lived up to the hype and was absolutely incredible.  New Yorkers brag that their pizza is the best so why not go to one of the best New York pizza establishments?  I loved both of my pizza.  One of them was a sobrassada.  I wasn't sure if the credit of the flavor went to the meat itself or the overall pizza, but damn it was good!  The other was the vodka pizza and it was an excellent creation.  My only complaint here was how I spent $58 (before gratuity) on two pizza pies?	4star
I had high hopes for this place based on the other reviews, but it turned out to be a disappointment. The decor is great, but the floor is dirty. The white parts of the checkered tiles are covered with scuff marks and shoe prints that the actually look gray (and it's a nice and sunny day, so there's no excuse of rain for the stains). I ordered shrimp tacos for appetizer, which were delicious. However, the tortillas were so tiny that there's no way to eat the tacos without half the fillings falling out before I even took a bite. I gave up after the first one and ended up eating the rest of the soggy mess with a fork and knife, which is no way to eat a taco! For entree I had the wild mushroom pappardelle. The sauce was rich, but it needed more seasoning. I put table salt in and it was better. The pasta, which I expected to be homemade, tasted like it came from a package.  The service was terrible. They didn't offer bread and the server did not check on me once during my entire meal. In fact, I've finished eating fifteen minutes ago and my table was cleared tight away, but I have been sitting here writing this review this whole time with no sight of the waiter. He must be there with all the other waitstaff goofing around at the corner (loud bursts of laughters can be heard every other minute). I just want to pay my bill and get out of here and never look back.	2star
"Their Roti Canai is a must! Came here with a friend for early dinner on a Wednesday. It wasn't crowded but I passed by here several times and saw how packed it can get during the weekends so plan accordingly. We were seated immediately, given that it was a hump day and not your ideal weather outside. We got the homemade Roti Canai ($3.95) aka their ""Indian pancake."" The pancake was crispy on the edges and the portion of the dish was big enough for two to share. The curry dipping sauce had a kick to it but I'm all about that spice so it was A+ in my books.  Another dish we ordered was the Curry Mee with Young Tau Foo ($8.50), which is essentially a bowl of egg noodles with spicy lemongrass coconut curry. Toppings included tofu and vegetables stuffed with minced dish. This also had a kick to it, which I loved. Soup was so flavorful, full of spice and the noodles were chewy indeed.  You can't go to a Malaysian restaurant without ordering Hainanese Chicken (1/4: $8.25 & 1/2: $10.95). I went with the quarter, which was more than enough for one person. Eat it with their chicken broth rice ($1.75) so you can drench it with their ""Chef's soy sauce."" You can also go with plain rice ($1.50), coconut rice ($1.75) or brown rice ($1.75). But trust me, you'll want the chicken broth one. I'm not a huge rice eater but when it comes with Hainanese chicken, it's a must. They seem to have a wide selection in their menu going from appetizers, soups, fried noodles, soup noodles, rice dishes, poultry, pork, beef, vegetarian options, casseroles, sizzling platters, seafood, lobsters and dungeon crabs. They also have dessert options and beverages including wine and beers. In addition, lunch special is from Mondays to Fridays (11am-4pm), served with their soup of the day.  It's so spacious inside, layout is somewhat in a ""L"" shape. I saw some servers cleaning vegetables in the back with some others taking cat naps where it's not really visible from the front of the restaurant. I noticed while walking to their restroom, which is located in the far back, straight down from the entrance. Overall, they have a wide selection, good service, lots of seating and reasonable prices. Only downside is that it's cash only. Nonetheless, I'll definitely come back again."	4star
Finally was able to visit this restaurant this past Tuesday evening with my sister & her friend. I was told when I called that I didn't need reservations because it wasn't a busy night so we just walked in and was seated right away. The restaurant was pretty spacious, and it had a nice decor. We decided to sit in the outside area because the AC was on full blast. We started off with drinks, we ordered the bourbon street mango juice, the Brooklyn Bellini & Pinot noir. All the drinks were good just thought they could gave more. Now for the entrées:  First, I must start off with the macaroni & cheese which might be like the best macaroni & cheese I've ever had. It was so cheesy but not a bad cheesy because it wasnt salty or clumpy & it was just smooth and flavorful. And it came out piping hot which I loved. Probably the best dish I ordered that night. I also ordered the salmon & it came with greens and mashed potatoes which was good but I enjoyed the other two dishes that everyone else had. My sister ordered the buttermilk fried chicken with the red velvet waffle, she loved it! The chicken was fried really well and did not lack in flavor. Her friend ordered the smoked BBQ chicken which looked and tasted really good as well. The chicken was tender and juicy and the BBQ sauce was delicious. Last but not least, the cornbread! Oh, I should have ordered some to go home. It was so good. The muffins were warm and yummy and then the butter with it just made everything better. LOVE!  I definitely enjoyed myself at SoCo, would wanna come back another time and order something else on menu & like 2 orders of cornbread lol & the macaroni & cheese of course.	4star
Food is fine, but service is lacking. I have been in PLG longer than the restaurant has. Additionally, I have many years of waiting, bartending and managing experience in the industry. Please hire a person to greet and seat or at least have a manager that is keeping an eye on the front door. Four of us strolled in for an impromptu meal. Stood up front not knowing what to do about getting a seat, decided to make our way towards the server but we're passed by a couple that requested a specific seat and we were overlooked, then had to sit communial while they had a table for four people!? Well at least we quickly decided on drinks and food. Dinner came and went but our cocktails did not. We paid and left before they were even made. Something is just not right. Maybe this is just good enough for now, but it's not good.	2star
Last evening (2/20) my cousins & I came to this restaurant.  Our wait was about 30-minutes.  Once we were seated, we received hot corn bread and our menus.  This was all of our first experience.  We want to eat at a Black-Owned restaurant for Black History Month. We all ordered our food, Chicken & Waffles, Fried Whiting & Waffles, Shrimp & Waffles & Garden Burger.  Our sides were, MAC & Cheese, Collard Greens & Cheesy Grits.  The food was very good. Con: The Cheesy Grits were salty I would definitely recommend this restaurant.	5star
***2.5 stars*** Honestly, the service threw me off at this place.  We had a reservation, but arrived almost 30 minutes early to take advantage of their happy hour at the bar.  This approach did not sit well with them and it left a bad taste in my mouth the rest of the night as the service continued to be poor.  The space was also very loud even though they were not full.  That said, my meal was tasty - I enjoyed the quinoa mushroom risotto - and my friends seemed to enjoy their meals.	2star
The pizza was awesome... crust was fresh :) 1 large is good for 4 people.  1 star less because center of the pizza was little uncooked & it was a sunny day but the 2nd floor of the restaurant was a little hot & stuffy :(	4star
"The first pic of this place when you type in Red Hook Lobster Pound is a shot of the lobster roll, generously heaped with lobster, taken in 2015. Well, not so much in July 2017 and for $25 per, this place will not see us anytime soon. What is so disappointing is that we ate there last year and swore that the rolls were stuffed with lobster and somewhat cheaper. Oh, well. Red Hook has arrived indeed, upscale prices and smaller portions. Red Hook Lobster ""1/8"" Pound."	2star
This is absolutely my favorite Italian place in NYC so far (had Del Posto, Ai Floria before). I ordered black truffle tasting menu and hubby ordered regular tasting menu. Every dish is just awesome and service is great! Definitely try black truffle tasting menu, it is a great deal!	5star
I'm so glad Sugar Freak is back.  The food is amazing. Had the cheese grits and eggs for brunch.  The texture of the grits combined with the flavor is brilliant. Authentic Louisiana comfort food.   The only problem was the host/hostess.  They took names and said they'd text. An hour later, no text and lots of tables empty.  When I asked how much longer, they sat us right away.  Needless to say they need to fix their seating process or they're gonna loose business. I do recommend this place as long as you are not in a rush and have time to wait to be seated.	4star
Deiced to give it a try since it has such high rating. We visited this place on a Saturday late afternoon around 4pm to try their happy hour menu. Service was decent the server quick bring us hot green tea once we sit down and keep refill it. We ordered french fries, general tso chicken, chicken wing, fried calamari, rock shrimp for the appetizer. For the sushi we order the spicy tuna, spicy yellow tail and shrimp tempura. The appetizer were great. Both me and my boyfriend were surprise that make the cheap food tasty and fresh and we were so gonna come back until I chew out a piece of steel dish brush...we ask about it and manager came immediately and apologize and gave us a free ice cream and $4 discount which is not bad. Not all the restaurant apologize for these kind of things. The problem is that after couple hour we get home, I started throwing up and next day both me and my boyfriend had bad diarrhea and its so difficult not to think because of this place since this was the only meal we had on Saturday... I am so upset that now I have to look for new place to solve my sushi craving in my neighborhood now... I am just so sad that I finally find a place with great service and delicious dish but not clean food...	2star
I love this place. I've never experience an outrageous wait - the hostess, Violeta, is super sweet. Love her - she used to work in Greek Captain, and is so personable. The food here is always good - I've experienced two mishaps: grilled calamari that wasn't cleaned properly, and non creamy tzatziki  Other than that - their seafood is amazing. You cannot come to Queens and not go here. It is such a staple.	4star
Pros: * Beautiful ambiance and decor. Great place to have late-night dinner before going to Brooklyn clubs such as Output or Verboten.  * Came on a Saturday night at 9:45PM, didn't wait longer than 10 minutes for a table.  * My friend and I loved the Greek Salad and Lamb Cous Cous- it was just the perfect amount of food for the 2 of us. My friend thought it was the best Greek salad she's had in NYC and the Lamb Cous Cous was rich in flavor and lamb fell off the bone. * Delicious cocktails- $11, a bit more affordable than Manhattan prices  * Service could be faster, we had to flag out waiter down for the check.  Looking forward to coming back to try their other dishes!	4star
Decided to give this place another chance. Unfortunately I came during lunch time and I really wanted to try the Salmon. So I decided to go with the Spice Chicken Sandwich and Calamari as an appetizer. The calamari was nasty and the chicken was HARD. Why is it that the CHICKEN IS ALWAYS SO HARD? It felt like eating a rock! This is my second complaint about the chicken being hard. The wait for the food is annoying. I also requested a seat by the Windows but the Polish waitress said supposedly it was reserved. I was in the restaurant for an hour and 30 minutes and the restaurant was DEAD.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL. This was my last time here. Goodbye & farewell.	1star
"What a disappointment. We came here with high expectation as Marea is one of the Michelin stars restaurant. Our reservation was at 12pm on Sunday and we opted for their business lunch menu(52 for 2 courses). Bread for selection included sour dough, multigrain and focaccia. I saw olive oil so I thought it would be appropriate to eat the bread with, but there's no plate for the olive oil except that for my bread, which didn't make sense as the two pieces of bread I choose already completely covered the small plate. No big deal though.  Here comes the story: I got a glass of champagne and my friend got a Moscato after sampling the Riesling and moscato. However my friend then realized she didn't like the moscato after having two little sips so we asked the lady if she could get the German Riesling. We knew that she probably wouldn't be able to get one because my friend sampled and decided, and we expected to be declined nicely. To our surprise the lady gave us really bad attitude by saying that ""I can't give you another glass for free(+attitude)"" and proceeded in taking the glass away, leaving the table without giving us enough time to process what she just said. Well she came back with the (free)German Riesling and said enjoy and again asked how our food was, which was nice gestures. Moreover,  she poured out wine with some dripping, which was really not a big deal but considering it's a Michelin star restaurant my review has to be relatively strict. First course: -Tuna tartare: pretty much season-less tuna and avocado with pine nuts at the bottom. The lemony sauce added nice flavor to the tuna but I would like the tuna to be more flavored. Overall okay. I hoped I had got the octopus. -lobster burrata($6supplement): delicious burrata and the lobster and oil combination were good.   Second course:  -fungi risotto: DONT GET THIS!! The worst risotto I've ever had in my life. It's served in a plate..what? It already looked bad in a plate AND tasted BAD. Yeah this dish is ugly and bad. The soy sauce on the risotto made the dish so salty at the same time did not complement the flavor of dish. I think if I made risotto first time myself without recipes, it probably came out like this.  -fusilli: it's their signature dish. I prefer the fusilli cooked maybe 1.5 min more as the texture was too firm to my liking. The sauce was decent but really nothing exceptional, not even close to 'wow it's delicious'. Our service was friendly and caring. We had the risotto sent back to the kitchen and ordered another dish, which was really mediocre. Coming to Marea was definitely not an experience, neither was the food. I don't understand how it's ranked Michelin?? Please just go to Jean Georges around the corner."	2star
So good! I come all the time for plantains & bacon wrapped dates--	5star
In one word? Awful. I was frustrated even trying to organize my thoughts for this review, mainly because of all the ways this restaurant went wrong. Let me try... A) the music : okay I get it that Nas is part owner, but honestly the place is so small and acoustics so poor that you really don't need speakers at two inch intervals throughout the establishment. Personally I felt like I was at a hip hop Chucky cheese.  B) the staff- the night in question featured a beautiful exotical at the door who seemed uninterested in anything but a clipboard. The waiters seem to be NYU anthropology students living in Williamsburg, and thoroughly frustrated with serving black patrons. I think we were checked on once the entire meal. I also had to use my skills as a former cheerleader to get my check or another soda. Moving on  C) the food- it couldn't get any worse. I tasted cinnamon on my Mac n cheese which looked sooo good on yelp. Fail. I was excited for the vegan fried chicken. Utter FAIL. It was a strange consistency - wet but shapeless and flavorless. The waffles were the best part but nothing to write home about. If you want real southern soul food with a flavor plus hip hop vibes head to Red rooster or Melba's in Harlem	1star
I was wondering if I would ever give a place a one star review because I figured a place would have to give me instantaneous diarrhea to be that terrible. But la esquina beat even those expectations so here is my very first ZERO star review! Congrats guys, you did it! We went here last night to meet a group of friends who were already seated downstairs with a reservation. Seems simple enough, go to the door, say we are with a party, and go have a good time with our friends. Unfortunately we had to come across two orcs at the door who don't understand the basics of human interaction.  Here is how it went: Me: Hello, good evening, we are here for the reservation under X Orc 1: whats the full name? Me: Let me tell you in a second (it was a friend of a friend so I didn't know the last name) Orc 1: Stand on the side Wife and I go stand on the side figuring we give Mr Troll the name and go in. Simple as that. Me: Excuse me, the full name is X Smith Orc 2: *Grunts while looking at his phone and ignores our existance* Orc 1 is busy letting other people in who say what seems like random names, doesn't even check his list or anything. So we wait patiently by the side thinking he'll get back to us once he sees we are waiting quietly. Unfortunately we have too much faith in humanity. Both orcs just continue to repeatedly ignore us while letting in people who are piss drunk and making a scene. Although I don't want to subscribe to a racial bias here I have to mention that we were the only 2 brown people there and we were the only ones being completely ignored. So this farce goes on for about 15 mins, our friends downstairs are incredulous that they aren't letting us in. Orc 1 has disappeared and orc 2 is being trollish with some other patron. Finally after about 25 minutes of just standing around I try and go explain the situation again to Orc 2. We are with a party, just 2 of us, one guy and one girl, we haven't even been drinking,  just want to go see our friends. Orc 2 again pretends I'm not speaking English, behaves in way that is probably going to cost him his teeth in another situation and just exhibits the kind of despicably disgusting behavior that makes you lose faith in the human race. That was about all I could take so we left. Dear management at la esquina, your establishment might be all that and I have no problems with you hiring ogres as door people but please at least educate them with some simple courtesy. I've gotten turned away from bars before and its not big deal but at least have the decency to tell people that you cannot let them in for whatever reason. Not make them stand in a corner and pretend like they don't exist. I don't care if you are goddamn White House, this sort of behaviour is unacceptable. You've definitely lost at least 2 patrons and with this attitude I'm sure many more will follow. Good riddance.	1star
"2 stars because online representation of this place gives so high expectation. And when you finally go there you was very disappointed. If it was just a regular unknown diner it would be 3 stars for food.  Last night i googled - best breakfast in NYC. And one of the first results was timeout web site where was in an article about best breakfast in NYC and also represents NYC in an article about best US breakfast spots. After reading article and looking on pictures especially on the picture of ""Green Shakshuka"" I'm thought that this place is awesome and should go have my breakfast there.  But when I went there this morning I found that the real food is nothing like it was on these fancy pictures online. It looked very casual and taste very casual.  The dish what I was very exited - Green Shakshuka ended up just to two roasted eggs with a bit salsa on the top and two pieces of bread.   And portions are very small."	2star
"Came here in search of one thing and one thing only, Allioli, a spanish condiment that I'm am unapologetically addicted to, and one, that as of yet, I've been unable to track down here in the states. Long story short, I didn't find what I was looking for, I found so much more!  For some reason or another I was expecting some ghetto grocery store (I don't know why, this is located in Manhattan after all), what I found is a very upscale Spanish store and eatery with an expansive selection of high quality wines, spirits, cured meats, premium canned seafood, oils, seasonings, and other delicacies from Espana.  I wish I'd stayed for their tapas which I'm just now reading are ""amazing,"" but I will be back!"	4star
This place was amazing! My boyfriend and I came to the city this past Sunday for brunch at Root & bone. We got Grandma's Angel biscuits which were AMAZING!! We also got the crispy fried bucket of bird ( 10/10) mac & cheese and the pork belly bacon. We loved everything and will definitely come back. Service was also great!   I do recommend making a reservation because it is a small place.	5star
Delicious thin crust pizza and yummy pasta in a fun restaurant! Came here at ~640pm on a Monday night with a group of 3 and we were told there would be a 40 MINUTE WAIT... on a random Monday night. It was so perplexing, but we had heard really good things so decided to go get a drink at a nearby bar while we waited. However, we had barely just sat down at the bar when we got a notification saying that our table was ready.. and this was in ~15-20 minutes!  We made our way back and were led into the back of the restaurant which has slightly more light and we seated at a picnic bench-sized table which already had a another group of 3. Although we were technically sharing the table, it was no trouble at all. We were starving, so ordered a ton of food to share... arugula salad, rice balls, mozz sticks, calamari, large Rubirosa Supreme pizza (photo attached) and small broccoli rabe + sausage cavatelli (photo attached), It was an insane amount of food and we didn't even finish everything but it was all delicious. We also all got the Rubirosa Daisy, which was sweet and refreshing.  Our server was very friendly and attentive, even though we took forever to decide on our drinks.  The drinks also did take a good amount of time to come out though, so we were already partway through our meal when they arrived.  Overall, a delicious meal -- lots of good food and a pretty fun vibe. I'd definitely come again, but in the future will try to make a reservation in advance or walk-in a bit earlier!	4star
"Ocean view is not bad, but also not mind blowing at the same time. We were lucky to see 17 swans right outside our window view. They joined us for dinner the whole night. This place seems to host a lot of events. There was a party in one of the big transparent rooms sectioned off and another table near us was celebrating there birthday there. The waiter tried to be funny and was very nice. However, miscellaneous items that we asked for took wayyy too long to come: lemon for water, paper napkins, another fork, etc. Food was nothing special. In fact, the pasta dish with baby clams had a ""bad clam"" and filled the pasta dish with sand! We didn't notice until half the sandy dish was already eaten...They gave us a whole new pasta dish with baby clam and this time, the clams some reason tasted much better! The margarita pizza was memorable out of the whole meal."	2star
This place is a great, upscale pizzeria bar. The pizza is amazing, comes out fresh to order. I can't compare the taste cause it is so different than other pizza bars, in an amazing way. I recommend the pepperoni and plain pie. If your drinking I had peronni on tap. The staff is very polite. I have been there about 3 times and it always great service. I had one episode with the wrong pie come out but it was so good it didn't matter cause I was forced to try something new. They offered to correct the mistake but there was no need to.	5star

I ordered vegetable momo(dumplings) at 7:21 PM on Tuesday night. There were 13 people seated. Meaning the restaurant was not crowded for dinner time. I was warned that it would take some time for my order, but not informed it meant more than 20 minutes for 8 dumplings. Really? Unbelievable. These 8 vegetable dumplings supposedly made from scratch were plain and flavorless.  This bad decision make and waste of both time and money was to earn miles. Yes, I stopped by here to earn AA advantage dining promotion. I thought it's better than just buying miles, but was totally wrong. None of restaurants in the program are worth time and money so far. If it wasn't for promotional 500 miles, I would have never come to this place. Never.	1star
For a place that's just starting up they doing great! The drinks and menu are creative and you just can't get a better and more welcoming staff! The general manager Bentley even introduced himself which is a rarity for hell's kitchen.  Definitely coming back!  If for nothing else for the Mr. Fluffleupaugus (one of their awesome specialty milkshake)	5star
The ambiance was severely lacking.  Upon entering, I was accosted with the smell of some ammonia cleaning product.  My eyes teared up from the chemicals.  We sat at tables that were too close together, while the bright fluorescent glow and noise of the kitchen made the rear tables even more unappealing.  The bread was stale, salad was okay. The noodles were overcooked and the sauces too heavy.  Then a new chemical scent accosted us, smelling like burnt crayons.  We couldn't figure out what it was, but we packed up our food and left to finish the rest at home.  Ahhh, what a relief.  Why eat out at such places anyway?  I can cook better than this any day.	2star
The sea Witch is a very chill bar with awesome decor, good beers on tap, and a kitchen that doesnt seem to close. The bartenders are really nice, and the beers are very well priced. I sometimes forget I'm in NYC when I'm in a place like this, because if its location was just a mile north, I'm sure prices would go up about 50%. The food is what really drew me in here, because many of the neighborhoods restaurants seem to be closed by midnight. I have tried their cheeseburger (great, but small), fried oysters (very crunchy and delicious!), pork schnitzel (tastes like chicken!, but even better!), and their fries are exceptional...I also realized you can order cheese fries there, though they are no on the menu...next time. The music here is also very good, and not played at a level that makes you have to scream to talk to your friends, very nice touch.  The back has a patio, which I havent checked out yet, but it looks like theres a koi pond back there, which will be awesome in the summer.	4star
"The purpose of our visit was to try their ""Lure Burger,"" ($21) part of our quest for Best Burger in NYC. The burger was pretty awesome - I was surprised to find such a good burger in a seafood restaurant. A juicy patty cooked to a nice medium (per our request), soft but durable bun, 2 crispy onion rings perched on top, and a side of perfect fries. It is a top contender - no complaints. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the miso glazed salmon ($35). The salmon was overcooked (we ordered medium), not flavorful (even a tad fishy), no crispy skin (my favorite part of seared fish), and a very small portion (4-5 oz where the standard is closer to 6-8 oz). The huge portion of vegetables was well-prepared, still snappy. No starch to anchor the dish. An overpriced healthy plate, very underwhelming... considering this is a seafood restaurant.  My biggest issue here was the service - the hostess looked peeved when we asked to be seated at a different table NOT under a spotlight (in the nearly empty restaurant). Why were we not offered the ""complimentary bread and chips"" that our neighboring tables had? Waiters were difficult to flag down, yet were overbearing trying to clear our plates (3 servers in 2 min asked to take our plate away, which we were still nibbling on.) The dessert menu was plunked at our table without a word. Maybe we weren't high-rollers compared to the other tables, however snootiness is not appreciated. If you're going to charge such a high premium for food, the food quality and service must match."	3star
Since it is first open I have been here so many times. Still remembered the old decorations and the places where they placed the drinks/flan before. Will always stop by when I am in Elm.	4star
Peters favorite pizza place in the city and for good reason. Amazing pies and awesome Italian food, the grilled octopus is perfect and everything else here is incredible too. I have yet to have a bad experience here, only drawback is how busy it is but it's because it's that good. Go eat pizza now !!!	5star
This place is hands down one of the best pizza places in Brooklyn and totally worth the wait. A line starts to form before they even open so to ensure a table almost right away it is best to get in line early. Waited in line approximately 45 minutes to an hour before they started seating. The restaurant has ample seating, faster to get seated if you are in a group of two. Ordered a white pizza with cherry tomatoes and it was delicious. The pizzas are made in a brick oven and the crust is of the perfect crunch level. Took a while for the waiter to take our order as the place was packed and also took longer to get the food. Totally worth the trip to Brooklyn to try this pizza. Upon finishing, there was still a line to get in. If you plan on going here to grab a bite, be prepared to wait a while to get seated and to be served.	5star
Korean tapas? Yes, please!  I am one to enjoy sharing small bites and having a taste of everything!  I really really enjoyed this place.  Let me preface that I am from LA and I have eaten in Koreatown LA a number of times, so I believe my expectations for good Korean food can be high.  This place is THAT good. I came on a Monday evening after some rain hit and it was still busy, but our friends who are regulars say that it can get busier. What we got: the octopus, truffle mac and cheese, the spicy gnocchi (order these first two together for a good cheesy and spicy balance), steak and grits, and the Capri-Thursday. The verdict: everything was delicious.  I did not try anything else, but I can say that what I did try was allllll so good! Please bring Thursday Kitchen to LA, please.  I have been craving that truffle mac and cheese since we emptied our plate.	5star
We had mixed experience here. It was an unplanned visit and this was the only decent Italian restaurant that we could find in the neighborhood so we decided to take our changes.  We were there on a Saturday evening and the host informed that there is about 20 mins wait for a party of 4 so we decided to wait. Our table was ready in preciously 20 mins but while we were entering the restaurant one of the guest had heated argument with the owner/manager not sure what it was but surely they were bing kicked out. After we sat down the disgruntled customer again came in and threaten the owner/manager and we found out that now we are sitting on the table that they had occupied. (not sure how i feed about that!) We placed our order of pasta and a bottle of wine to share.  Food was decent. two out of 4 dishes were 4/5 where as other two were 2/5 so averaging them at 3/5. The wine was quite small for the price but still it was fine. It was one of my friend's birthday and they did give us a complementary Tiramisu which was quite nice of them. Now when it came to billing, they gave us a bill with the food ordered by people whom they had kicked out( remember they were still on the same table that we had occupied now) added to it. Things go resolved quickly. Another thing which bugged me is that it was a cash only place. A place where 4 person meal cost about $120, it's odd to keep it cash only. They have ATM on premise but not a fan of paying $2.5 for the ATM changes and extra what the bank will change. Might now go back.	3star
Went for a late brunch at 2 on Mother's Dag. Ordered the Burger and the Chicken & Waffles. The food was good. Not real good, but not bad. It's just standard. The music they have playinf for brunch spun by a DJ was so loud we couldn't talk. I want to like this place a little more since it's in my hood, but to me it's just good.	3star
PLEASE NOTE: there is a 4% service charge added to your meal in addition to the customary sales tax and your tip.  I was not aware of this and the bill was communicated to me by word of mouth so I was never told about this fact until after I had paid and checked my email for my receipt which arrived afterward. I find this practice to be incredibly deceptive and won't return. My coworker opted to pay cash and never received a copy of her bill so this was just as surprising to her.	1star
Got our food extremely quick and it tasted delicious! A great place to go when you're starving!	5star
3.5 stars average (4 for me, 3 for my SO) Average to above-average Japanese fare, went here for brunch with my significant other. Had the katsu don (solid) and she got the una-tama don (good but overly sweet sauce). Textures were really good but the flavors seemed a bit formulaic. Atmosphere felt like a hipster bar in Brooklyn that happened to serve a lot of Japanese food, sake, and American beer.	4star
Disappointed. I'd been looking forward to a meal with friends, I had the pasta Bolognese and had to complain to two of the waiters about the portion size of the meat sauce, which was a tablespoon of meat, it tasted ok but it wasn't enough, they offered to make my meal again, but as I was with friends including my husband's boss, I was too embarrassed and just ate it...I didn't want it making again, I just wanted more sauce. The menu described that it was served with parmesan cheese, I had to wave a waiter to get this, it wasn't offered. Nobody checked on us to see if everything was ok.....it wasn't.  I left feeling hungry and had to make myself a sandwich when I got home. The meals here aren't stand alone, they expect you to have antipasti, 1st plate, 2nd plate, dessert, which would cost a fortune. My meal wasn't worth $18, it must've cost just a few cents to make, I could've made a tastier & heartier meal with some pasta & ground meat from Trader Joe's and a jar of pizza sauce from Dollar Tree. One star lost for the gimmick of having multiple chefs cooking in the dining area, it made the restaurant way too hot. One star lost for the $8 tiramisu, it was nice, but again a tiny portion. They get one star for the nice breadstuffs, and one for the nice but expensive gin based cocktail. I was disappointed and upset with my meal, the portion size was suitable for a 10 year old, I ate it in 2 minutes, if my husband's boss hadn't have been with us I would have demanded a few more spoonfuls of sauce. What a waste of money, I will not eat here again and to be honest it's put me right off Italian restaurants, I can make better at home, I could have cried it was so crap :-(	2star
I went back on my word & ordered here again. I wanted to give one more try. I'm a glutton for punishment. The damn calamari is so damn soggy, again!!!! Why? It used to be so perfect. They were my holy grail for calamari. But no more. My pho was just ok. The spicy  veggie curry was not as spicy & a little on the bland side. My mom said her salmon sambal was good tho. Whatever they changed, it has lost them a household of customers. Unfortunately, they now fall into the category of eateries that have gotten popular, raised their prices, & let the quality & taste (that made them popular) fall by the wayside. Currently looking for a replacement. Dang it!!! This is my 3rd update. I erroneously edited my second review instead of updating it, thus deleting it for ever urghhhhh!!!!	2star
"Service and management awful.  Food is good, but ruined by horrible service and rude management.   Recap of our evening: arrive and are ignored by waiter.  Waiter finally comes by, takes drink order and we order mezze.  He comes back with drinks and tells us that he'll ""come back in 5 minutes and will take appetizer and entree orders at the same time.""  Thanks for the directive as to how you'll take our order. Generally, the customer decides how they will order. Waiter takes our order.  Staff comes by 5 minutes later and tries to remove our mezze and plate although it's clear we're not done and our entrees are nowhere in sight.  I ask the busboy for another drink, odd as manager has been by TWICE to ask if everything is okay but doesn't notice I have an empty glass.  Waiter comes and I ask for drink again (fine busbys not always the right person but who was there to ask?).  Drink never comes.  Obnoxious manager stops by our table a third time and asks if everything is okay, I say well I'd like a another drink. He does get it and apologizes for the wait. Entrees arrive but 2 sides are missing.  They don't deliver the missing sides until we are done with out entrees so we don't get to eat them but they don't even offer to comp them or take them back. Had we not been with another couple I would have made a fuss immediately after receiving the check.   We are chatting and eating and mostly done, but all of a sudden the death squad swoops in - I kid you not 2 busboys, our waiter and the obnoxious manager, and removes all of our plates without asking if we are done. Incredibly rude especially as we've waited long pauses between courses, drinks etc because they were incompetent.  Only to be topped by our decision to order a drink and talk (which we would have dne over food but they took it away) and the manager came to our table and ASKED US TO LEAVE. Wow, new low of dining etiquette even for America.  Never will return as experience was awful. Oh, did I forget that when they closed the roof they now have interrogation lighting that shines on every table in the garden making everyone squint and feel uncomfortable?  It's a great touch for a restaurant that wants it diners to eat like they're in a cafeteria. Of course when I hear a neighboring table complain and ask for the lights to be dimmed the same rude manager dismissed them.  #1 recommendation to the owner, fire your manager who worked on 6/28 and maybe you can reclaim come clientel"	2star
"I really want to give hometown BBQ 5 stars, because their BBQ is hands down the best I've ever had. The pulled pork? Great! The lamb belly? Omg yum! The beef rib? To die for! So why 4 stars? Well, we waited a good 2 hours before we can get our food, even though it was a ""sorry but not sorry"" situation after we took our first bite. All I can say is that try to get here early to avoid the super long lineup."	4star
I love tapas style because it's small portioned and I can order a lot of different dishes. So that's exactly what I did!  Ugly Potato I was gonna ask the waiter/waitress why the dish was called Ugly Potato, but I forgot :( But the potatoes were crisp, and I'm a big fan of cheese and BBQ sauce sooo...I loved it! Mushroom Probably my FAVORITE dish. It was unavailable when we first got to the restaurant (12:30pm), but they said it would be unavailable at 1pm so we decided to eat other dishes as we waited. SO GLAD we waited. The spiciness...the truffles...ohmylawd. And that poached egg was cooked perfectly. ALMOST licked the plate, but I was able to refrain. I would come back just for this dish.  Egg of Busan Honestly, it was basically an egg on top of a tortilla. So it wasn't the most creative dish I guess? But when we went, they served this dish with the pork gratin, and since the pork gratin was heavy, the Egg of Busan made it balance. I ended up scooping some of the pork gratin on top the Egg of Busan and I thought it paired really well haha Soft Shell Crab I was surprised that it was a whole (little) crab! It came out and I was like OOHH. But I felt like there was too much batter/fried parts. Like the legs were basically all batter. But the middle part was yummy!  Pork Gratin I'm not a big pork eater, so my views may be a bit biased. There were some pieces that were too fatty. Nonetheless, the dish was still yummy! I ate the non-fat parts haha. But since it's a gratin, the mix of three kinds of cheese made the dish a little heavy. Crispy Chicken Probably....my second favorite? I liked how crispy it was and how it had a hint of spice. And I was a big fan of how they topped the chicken with black sesame. Definitely enhanced the flavor too!  Service/Staff Staff was super friendly, good-looking crowd haha. Service was also attentive. Dishes came out quick and hot and they responsibly refilled your water whenever it was low. Thank you!!~ Will definitely be back!	4star
"Disgusting experience! I was the sole customer left before closing tonight, and they failed to settle my bill. I had 2 dogfish IPa and a texas burger for $28. I gave them a $100 bill. I get the right change of $72 then I gave the bartender  ""Jessica"" a $10 tip, which leaves $62. I decide to have another drink and share a vodka shot with Jessica for a good service.  She takes my $62 from the table to pay for the 2 shots....and I don't get a change back??? WTF, when I ask, the manager says the bill is settled? JESSICA all of a sudden doesnt remember the $62 on the table that she took, and im hosed. The bar manager and jessica claims they never saw a $100 bill from me, and accuse me of being drunk. How is it that i got $72 change if I had not given them $100 bill. They are both either so drunk, stupid, or they really want to keep what they stole from me because they are both in on it. Russian girl friend of the manager even grabbed my arm to show force, and I told her to "" get your hands off me!"", but her witness friends denied that it ever happened.(liars) So I called the cops, and made a formal complaint and is on record! These people are crooked, when the owners are not present (Sal). The people behind bars were drunk liberraly taking drinks from the bar for themselves and are stealing from customers and will gang up on you to protect the money they stole!   Fellow Customers beware, the hired help behind the bar cannot be trusted and will steal your money and collaborate on a lie. The food and beer was great, no complaints, until this episode when these crooks decide to stiff me. ( Sal, fire these people, it's bad for business, or make sanctions to improve the integrity of your staff.)"	1star
Yum yum yum ! Def worth a pit stop in between that shopping . Food is great , coffee is amazing!	4star
Was really excited to have some yummy Italian food... Unfortunately it was the worst food I've had in a while. The stuffed mushrooms tasted like they were from a jar and as I believe were also undercooked. The veal was all chewy and hard with over cooked tasteless veggies so I just had to return it... The lasagna I decided to go with for a second attempt was also a disaster, the tomato sauce tasted exactly like it came out of a tin can. I had heartburn halfway through the meal so I just wrapped it to go so a dog can finish it off but now I'm thinking no puppy deserves this cruelty.  The only good thing they had was the bread. Wish it was a good place cause by reading their menu I wanted to taste all their dishes but after having three of them I will not come back :(.	1star
"I was interested in visiting this location based off other yelp reviews. It has a very attractive menu as well. However the website failed to mention details on a dress code other than a ""no hats"" policy. It would be very helpful to know that tank tops are not allowed here during the summer. Needless to say I won't be returning to this location as the host was very rude when he asked us to leave. Ah well we were happy to take our business elsewhere."	1star
First off what kind of pizza shop not have PLAIN pizza on hand?! When I asked when there would be a plain slice available, the guy at the counter said 45mins. FOR A PLAIN! So I settled for this mediocre looking spinach and mushroom slice. Turns out it tasted mediocre and then I ended up having food poisoning shortly after. The place is dirty, service sucks, staff is rude and most importantly unhygienic!	1star
WOW...like other Yelpers, this was my first reaction walking into the restaurant. Took my mom here for lunch because I saw this was such a beautiful restaurant with a good lunch special so who can resist? We didn't have reservations but came early enough that they sat us right away. It was empty...and in less than 15 minutes, this place was full house. It is a gorgeous restaurant and takes you away from the feel of busy NYC. Even their menu was nice!  Lunch special comes with a soup or salad, choice of appetizer and entree roughly $12-15 depending on your meat. I got the salad and steamed pork and shrimp dumpling. Not bad. Basic appetizers. Got the sauteed chicken in ginger sauce with steamed veggies and rice. Pretty good. I would definitely order it again. The chicken was coated in some sort of light breading which added a nice texture. I liked the sauce. Mom got pad thai which was standard but it's a fairly large portion for lunch. Thai iced tea was also good for $3.50. I'm sure you can get it cheaper elsewhere but highly unlikely for Flatiron.  Great service and yummy food. Would definitely come back for dinner.	4star
I saw so many rave reviews and heard so many good things that I had to try it! But even though the food was just ok - the beef noodle soup wasn't super flavorful although the noodles were good - the cleanliness level was pretty sus. The lady serving me had a loose band-aid and put her fingers in my bowl, and a lot of things, including my bowl and my spoon, looked like they hadn't been properly washed. I'm more than willing to pay a few extra dollars for better service and atmosphere. I just couldn't even stomach the food here.	1star
Overall very disappointing. when you wait at the bar they give you their snacks ( olives, potato chips, and nuts... ) really? at the number 1 restaurant in the world? we could not believe it. Then we sat and we got the same white and black cockies that they always gave you. ( you also use to finished with that, now they skipped)  then we wait for 20 minutes to get the snack, that honestly had nothing to impress. neither say we were expecting much more for being the number one of the best 50. then nothing was really wow, the duck now they dont even sow it to you. we just got the breast.  we had much better experience before the renovation 2 years ago. agree with some reviews ... the cheese plate is heavy, and too big for us. none on the table had more than one bite. deserts were all just ok. the waiting between courses was extremely long. and we all got really bored.   Sorry but EMD didn't met our expectations at all....  honestly made us feel  that all this awards and stars and  press and etc etc its all BU&%$!!#@IT!!!!	2star
Came here on a Wednesday night for dinner. The food took 70 minutes to come out. Horrible. I ordered a salad and it was drenched in dressing. I literally had to grab my fork and pour the dressing out. Also tried the bolognese and rib eye. Both par, nothing special. Asked for medium rare and it came out medium. I could have cooked a better steak at home. The service was so slow. The waiter took our check and came back in 10-15 minutes asking if everything was ok. We wanted change and had to ask for it twice.	1star
well I've been here before and the big steaks have been great. not today. 130 dollar bad smell lard drowned loaf of no. for four. tho maybe our fault for talking polidicks at the table.	2star
UPDATE: This place has seriously gone downhill in the last 6 months. Service is mediocre at best and, worst of all, they have cut down and cheap-ified their menu. That NY strip dish I mentioned below is now a hanger steak with idaho spuds, no beets, no bechamel, no fingerlings. Pork belly is no longer on the menu. Second to last time I went, we had to wait to get sat, even though we had a reservation, nobody but the water guy approached our table for 10 minutes, we were bummed about the trimmed down menu and walked out. And the host who'd just sat us said goodbye on the way out! Made the mistake of going again a few weeks later, and I'll never go back. Simple, creative and high quality dishes in a warm, low key atmosphere. I had the New York Strip with roasted beets and their greens. They added roasted fingerlings and topped the whole thing with this pureed onion/Bechamel sauce and a sweet puree sauce made from the beets. Also tasted the pork belly, which was rich and delicious.  I found the prices to be reasonable for the quality and depth of the food. Show me where else I can find a NY strip with a generous helping of fresh veggie sides cooked to perfection for 25 bucks, and I'll check it out. Our dishes could've easily run $40+ a plate at a high-end steakhouse. This place is on Sam Sifton's favorite 50 restaurants in NY and I can definitely understand why. They also take credit cards now, too..	1star
My friend and I dropped by for some lunch this afternoon.  I absolutely loved the decor the moment I walked in. They were rather busy at lunch service but a waitress came over and had us seated right away. We did request if they had outdoor seating but the back was full so we took indoor seats.  Once we were seated a bus boy came over with two glasses of water and that's where the good service ended. We sat for about 10 minutes while waitstaff kept passing by but no one thought to bring us menus. After 10 minutes and me being a little frustrated I flagged down a waiter who graciously brought us some menus.  Not even 5 seconds of our menus being on our tables a waitress comes over and asks if we're ready to order. I found that quite comical even though it wasn't actually funny.  Finally, we go through the menu and YAY! They have the couscous that I love. When our waitress came back, we ordered a bunch of apps. Hummus, Babganush, Falafel, Pita, Pickles & Olives. We then ordered the vegetarian couscous, a glass of red and one Rośe.  The only reason I cannot give this place 5 stars is for service. The food was absolutely delicious. I, who is not a fan of hummus and Babganush really really enjoyed it. The taste and textures were all very pleasing. The falafel was just as tasty.  I used to get the vegetarian couscous at a different Cafe but they stopped selling it. Now that I found it here at Mogador, aside for service, I am completely sold! They cook the couscous in butter which gives it a soft and airy texture as well as delicious tastes from the cooked veggies piled on top. A definite must get.  I really do like this place. I just wish service would be that bit better.	3star
The best pizza I have had in the city so far! The pepperoni pizza is so delicious and sliced really thin and crispy. I would definitely recommend this spot for a nice pizza experience, not a slice kind of spot but that's my preference anyway!	5star
Overall big fan of Momofuku restaurants but service was sub par on a Saturday night. Took over 30 minutes after seated to get a drink and 15 minutes of that was waiting for the waiter. Over heard other tables complaining about service as well. Disappointing	1star
The orecchiette was good, pizza was ok, creme brûlée didn't have a crunchy top and service was horrible. Bread was weak too. Our server mumbled, was slow to greet us and didn't have any recommendations. Pick another Italian place close to time square to eat at.	1star
Great place for a long lunch with wine in FiDi. Relaxing atmosphere and nice food.	4star
"OWNER/EMPLOYEE HAS ANGER MANAGEMENT ISSUES. :/ I wish I could give less than 1 star. We were treated awfully. I was having some drinks with a friend, and noticed someones hand was on the back of my chair as they were talking to their friend who was sitting directly behind me, making it impossible for me to sit back. I figured it was just a mistake, so I politely asked the man if he could move his hand off of my chair, not a huge request! He obliged, but he gave me the dirtiest look afterward... I continued to have some drinks with my friend, and then we asked for the bill to settle up our night. Except...the bill never came. Apparently the guy who was sitting behind us paid our entire tab! My friend told him that was very sweet and he didn't have to do that. The response that followed was unexpected: ""It's not your chair, it's MY CHAIR, I work here 60 hours a week. How dare you say anything to me! I paid your tab so you can leave!"" So it looks like we found the owner, and he has some anger management issues! We tried to reason with him, and he got in my face and tried to grab my arm, my friend stepped in however. A second employee stepped in and I asked if he was the owner. The man just told me to leave. WELL, guess where I'm never going back to!"	1star
"I don't know what's left to be said about Gramercy Tavern except ""wow...omg, and everything in between"".  What a magnificent experience in a stunningly beautiful room with intelligent and impeccable service and food that is nothing short of spectacular in every sense of the word.

Gramercy Tavern in NYC dining at its best, friendly, welcoming and oozing NY style and sophistication.  Can't wait to return."	5star
The food here is about average but I would be willing to try again but the service isn't great.  We  came here on a Thursday night with the place 1/3 empty and still took forever for our order to be taken.  The food took a long time and bizarrely the entree came out at the same time as the appetizer.  I specifically told the waitress I didn't like things spicy and asked for the appetizer to be mild and she never thought to tell me that my entree was very spicy.	2star
Staff was very helpful making sure we didn't order too much food. The burnt ends baked beans were amazing. The sausage was my fave along with the brisket.	5star
We had  Stirred fry string beans. Very oily.  Sweet and sour fish. The deep fried fish was crispy but had weird smell. The sauce was too sweet.  We came here because of yelp's review and very disappointed.  Stirred fried broccoli was super sweet. We couldn't finish it.   Fried rice was good not oily and had nice aroma.  Pepper crispy duck was ok but not crispy    The best dish was xiao long Pao. The soup was very tasty. The skin wasn't as thin as dim tai fung's.	2star
The service is absolutely terrible.  From the start, we were hesitant because the waiter did not write any of our orders down. After he took our order, he avoided eye contact with us for the rest of the meal and then completely disappeared at the end. He seemed to be very attentive with everyone else. As we'd suspected, we waited and waited, but he forgot one of our dishes. When we asked the manager about it, a different waiter brought out the wrong dish. They took it back, and we didn't see him again for a while. We were nearly done with the rest of our meal.  At the end of the meal, the entire staff seemed to be avoiding us, even the manager. We were even waving at waiters as they walked by, but they ignored us until we finally had to shout at someone to get our check. This place is also no-tip, which usually seems great, but it seems it just gives 0 incentive for this waiter to do anything.  The food wasn't bad, but for the price and the awful service, it'd be better to go into Manhattan for Szechuan.	1star
Food was really good and the waitress was very attentive. Seem to be slightly understaffed and it took a little longer then you might expect, but was continually greeted with smiles and courteous service. Prices were very reasonable considering where it is and what is available around it.	4star
So I came here for a nice brunch. Guess what didn't happen? What's worse, the waitress cracking a glass jar of cream and spilling it all over your buddies at the table, or having another waitress take your card, run it 8x, then come back to your table proclaiming, THE CARD IS DENIED? No, this is worse - Dealing with your stupid face when I ask that we be moved because there is literally cream all over my sneakers, table, the next booths coat, the bench, along with shards of the cream jar.  No wait, forgot one. Looking at the bill, and seeing no initial attempt at compensation, and asking for the manager, only for him to be very apologetic (thank you for that at least) offer a discount and some drinks on the house. But wait...the waitress isn't done yet. Let's run the charge card 8x and when it asks for an AMEX pin, which is LOCATED ON THE FRONT OF THE CARD, let's put a random number on the back of the cars and activate fraud protection on my card. Yes, let's do that. I've attached a screenshot of my fraud detection email from amex, after having to put detections on all the charges, hoping none of them would go through, after waiting on hold for 29 minutes with amex. Thank you, LTAHUA, for ruining my Saturday afternoon. One star because I called them afterwards to ask about them making sure they didn't go through with their initial charges (I wound up paying with a VISA) and the manager said they would follow up with me the following Monday.  Took my name and number, never heard back. I'm sure the food would have been been, but this place left too much of a terrible taste in my mouth for me to notice.	1star
If you look at other reviews, you will see that most say the food is great. I agree. Food is wonderful. So why one star? I have never been treated more rudely by a wait staff or manager in my life! When I complained to the manager about the server being rude, he said, she had complained that I was rude!  The rest of my party and other people around, basically dropped their jaws at his rudeness!  I refused to get into a brawl with this man.  If you read other reviews here, you will see that rudeness by the staff is the major complaint. So, if you don't mind dropping $650 for 4 people for good food, but treated like you are dirt, This restaurant is for you!!	1star
I have dined at Tiny's several times before, and have enjoyed both the cozy ambiance and the interesting/tasty variety of dishes. It's incredibly unfortunate that my experience today, however, has made the possibility of coming back here remote at best.   My friend and I had placed our orders and my dish was the first to arrive.  After a few minutes we inquired several times as to the whereabouts of my friend's dish with one employee, who was the only person we could find, as our waitress completely disappeared for about 20 minutes.  After inquiring for the 4th time with ANOTHER employee, he disclosed to us that the order in fact had never even been placed, though we saw the same order be given to a woman who had sat down a good 15 minutes after us.  I ended up having to split my meal with my friend so he wouldn't starve to death. After finally being able to cancel my friend's order, we brought our bill up to the front to explain the situation - the staff was only slightly apologetic as they seemed focused on other matters.  Not only did I exit the restaurant greatly disappointed in the staff's lack of attentiveness towards us, but we also left hungry for a long afternoon of back to back meetings.	1star
I haven't been back in a long time, mostly because every time I pass by Sugar Freak, the place is packed to the gills and for a good reason. Their food is simply outstanding. Upon my visit I had not just your regular mac and cheese but mac smothered with crawfish. Set in a deep baking dish, this sucker is loaded down with fresh crawfish tails and the macaroni is a perfectly creamy to cheesy ratio. I also tried their mac covered with a runny egg. Not really my thing. But I can see why this is delectable and appealing.  For drinks they have a nice variety of Abitas and a few other beers. Their cocktails I never tried but I've walked by a couple of times and have noticed happy hour hurricanes and its tempting. I hear their jambalaya and johnny cakes are solid. Have to come back to try more things. Especially knowing that they make a salad out of meat here. This atrocity to nature is called a muffaletta salad and is made up of mozz, provolone, mortadella, salami, and ham with you know. . . . some salad thrown in there. Then of course they have a variety of po boy sandwiches.  Also, if you need to brush up on your American History and Presidents before the election, they have place mats on the tables with every president and the years they were in office. It quickly turned into a very informative brunch.	5star
I have been to this place a few times, but still have not had a good meal there. I see lines of people outside all the time, but have not figured out why! My last meal there last week was steamed fish, which had a wet and gooey layer of spices and flour or breadcrumbs on it, and was absolutely tasteless, in spite of all the salt and pepper I added. I am giving this restaurant a 2, because at least the Clam chowder is tasty! I guess it fares as well as most of the restaurants in City Island.	2star
"As soon as I walked in, I was blown away by the decor. It's so extravagant.. I came here with a friend...but I will definitely come again on a date to enjoy the amazing design. They have this Buddha waterfall thing.. (you'll know what I'm talking about when you walk in) that I thought was pretty cool.  Drinks - tasty, strong enough to leave you with a buzz.  Food - I had the Panang Curry, and I asked the waitress to make it extra spicy. I always make this request at Thai restaurants, expecting the dish to still be ..not as spicy as I'd like. But wow, Thai Villa hooked that ish up with the spices. It was a little TOO spicy for me to fully enjoy it, so I'd recommend asking for ""spicy but not too spicy"". This is crucial! Before we even started eating, we got complimentary watermelon squares topped with some sort of spice. I have no idea what the watermelon cubes were topped with, but they were tasty. It was a great start to our meal. This place seems to get packed - I had to wait around 40 minutes when I ate dinner at 9PM. So, I can imagine what the wait is like when it's normal dinner time. They text you when your table is ready, so you should put your name down and wander the streets of Flatiron while you wait."	5star
If I had the option of giving it ZERO STARS I would.  I ate the Curry Oxtail about 1.5 weeks ago and as far as taste go, it was bland.  However, I'm not here to critique their flavor - I am writing to let you all know of how sick I became after eating from their truck.  I was stricken with food poisoning for more than a week, running to the restroom every few minutes. I ended up going to the hospital for dear life where I was diagnosed with E.Coli.  This truck does not pass as far as hygiene goes.  Someone must have not washed their shitty hands after they wiped their a$$.  I would NOT recommend anyone to eat here.	1star
Very popular Korea BBQ place in K-town.  My friends and I got there at 6PM sharp and secured one of the last tables.  The wait is phenomenal despite the servers working crazy fast to feed you.  The whole meal lasted a little shy of 90 minutes.  Food is a solid 4-star but the whole experience was so rushed I hardly paused to really taste the food.	3star
We love this place.  It is an amazing neighborhood joint, super low key, friendly and inviting.  Everyone who works there is extremely friendly and goes above and beyond to make sure you have a great time.  We had the tacos, steak lolipops and the quinoa salad.  The sangria is awesome, I just wish they served it out of bigger glasses!	4star
"THE SHOP Mamak is a medium size ""one stop shop"" for Asian cuisine. The menu is divided into three columns: Thai, Vietnamese, and Malaysian, and each section has the appropriate staples in their most traditional forms. Initially this was a red flag for me, as I believe restaurants should stick to one thing, and do it well, however, after passing by Mamak for the twentieth time, I finally gave in. THE PHO While I cannot yet speak to the Thai or Malaysian dishes, the pho dac biet was a pleasant surprise. The broth is dark, clear, and is the sweetest of the pho broths I have had, indicating a strong southern influence. The bowl is filled with fatty brisket, flank, sweet balls of meat, raw onions (which added a nice crunch), cilantro, and diced chives.  The noodles are semi-wide and the broth is HOT, HOT, HOT, which ordinarily is perfect for cooking the raw cuts of meat, however the meat was already cooked through, and seemed rather tough mid-way through my experience. There is no tendon included, which would have been nice to balance out the tougher cuts of meat, and the meatballs didn't have bits of tendon interwoven either. This was a definite negative for me, but this is purely personal preference.  Make sure to add a bit of the accompanying lime wedge into the bowl, as the citrus compliments the sweetness very nicely.  SERVICE AND ATMOSPHERE Service is adequate, but really not the focus. The atmosphere is casual, and it should be. This is a no frills stop for a delicious bowl of sweet pho. Portions are on the smaller side, which makes this a spot perfect for a quick bowl during a busy day, or before you go out at night. There are multiple tables that can seat up to 4, and a few tables for couples. There are also outdoor tables, which I have yet to ever see set up, but must at some point be available, otherwise they wouldn't be there."	4star
I LOVE asian wings, Ive had many in my past including this place a few times before however this was an unpleasant experience. First of all just to make it clear they DO NOT have Soy garlic wings like most pictures and comments say.. its Either SOY or GARLIC. Well I went with the soy, they were dry on the outside with lack of flavor and meat was dry as well. Smh  Than there was the spicy wings Flavor was good however I do eat Spicy food but medium is SO spicy makes it hard to enjoy its unique flavor. Extra crispy was Not what expected its more like extra soggy and it $2 more.  Fries... $10 idk how they even come up with that price. Not crispy barely any truffle, mcDonalds fries are better.. Customer service for take out SUCKS, i spoke to 3 people before I can place an order, waited almost an hour for take out just for it to suck. $40??? I dont get it.	2star
"I've tried many a fried chicken spots in the city. Many are good, some are even great but peaches is in a category of its own. The seasoning is perfect, the chicken is fried to perfection and the sides are consistently great. Until I make it to Nashville for a fried chicken tasting Peaches reigns supreme. Speaking of Nashville, the ""Nashville style"" extra spicy chicken is NO JOKE. Prepare to literally set yourself on fire with that one. If you're sensitive to spice even I'd recommend going even a notch below regular hot which itself is hoottt."	5star
"As someone who lived in Hawaii for 10 years, I'm baffled by all the high marks for Red Poke. Can we attribute the overrating of this restaurant to mass hysteria? ""Poke craze"" fever? Maybe the people who are writing these reviews have never had Poke in Hawaii? We may never know. The dish I ordered featured fish I would not call high-quality. When a friend of mine visiting NYC couldn't finish her bowl because she found it unappetizing (she was also from Hawaii), I finished it for her, giving the place a second chance. Bad idea. Again, the fish wasn't great and the sauce was overpowering. Granted, the restaurant is clean and the people are nice enough. However, if I want Poke, I am not getting it here."	1star
Best Dinning out experience is a long time! Place was beautiful, service was excellent, the food out of this world.  To start we had the Asian calamari, two ceviches,  Entree Salmon with lobster mash potatoes, plantain wrapped red snapper, and the cabello dish, desert we had the chocolate cake and tres leches. Excellent, excellent. We are foodie people and dine out all the time. Like I said, the best.  Pretty pricey. Worth it. Almost two hundred dollars for three.	5star
Are you looking for a super loud restaurant that throws in a live mariachi band to blast music into your ears? Then this is the place for you! Perhaps I just wasn't in the mood, but I found it incredibly irritating. The food was OK but way overpriced. I mean I understand this is NYC, but come on.	1star
"So I'm giving this place three stars due to the fact hat they have no FRIES.  There potato excuses are just that, cold, burned, not exciting.  I've been coming to this place for years, the ""Rock your Face Off"" oyster dish is EVERYTHING and the bacon sample for brunch is the tops.  The space is nice and all...they've been around for a while so I hope they get fries and stay longer... Yeah what was the point?  I was fries with my Oysters"	3star
We decided to eat inside the restaurant. It was busy, but there were a few seats open. We ordered two plain slices and the Baked Clams to split. I was sad to see the slices were round, only because I came to try the square. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The pizza is your classic NY slice. No bullshit, just a wholesome slice of cheese. The baked clams came after and were pretty good. We split a Spumoni and chocolate cake to finish. The service is quick and gets things done. We decided to get some square slices to bring home, and Wow- That is why I would come back.	3star
MY GO TO SPOT FOR BAHN Mí. Honestly the bulgogi bahn mi (without jalapeño) is just the bomb! Plus the loaded fries but those came after, before I would just get the bulgogi  it's so goood and savory. I'm drooling right now.	5star
Can I give more than 5 stars?! We went for the first time to their first annual lobster week. We made a reservation (highly suggest it!!) and had a fantastic dinner. Every person we interacted with was friendly and super accommodating. One of the owners came over to check in on our meal - perfectly cooked lobster with potatoes and corn. Everyone should go, it's amazing and we can't wait to go back!	5star
I want to like this place, but the staff is so consistently rude that in spite of a nice ambiance and good food, I always leave feeling worse than when I came in.  I have had a few negative experiences with various servers, mostly during the evenings when they seem overwhelmed and let their poor attitudes and sullen expressions bum out the patrons.  These were always balanced by a pleasant brunch or drink on a quiet night.  However, after my encounter with the bartender who worked this evening, I have officially vowed to never set foot in this bar again.  I don't know why such a rude, socially inept, insulting individual would have, and keep, a job where they interact face to face with customers.  Management obviously allows this kind of behavior, so I'm done with this place.	1star
So apparently this is a really popular and tasty ramen place... it was okay.  I don't know what all the hype is about, but the soup for most of the ramen doesn't taste brothy/creamy enough. I've been spoiled with inexpensive and extremely tasty ramen in San Gabriel Valley and Los Angeles. Why is ramen $15 and without the egg too? It's so easy to make. I got the Akamaru Modern and was disappointed.  I'm still glad I came because the baos were amaaaaazing! Everything else was O- K.	3star
I came across it while looking for a  restaurant in the Dumbo area on a Saturday night.  The wait period to be seated was very short, it's very low key and they have a great wine selection. I had the crab cocktail with avocado and oranges for appetizer and it was a great combo.  Service was also great.	5star
The atmosphere is great. The drinks we had were good and the bartender we had was cute and charming. but this place is too damn expensive. I live and work in the area so I understand the price point around here too.	3star
Drinks were good but the food was ok - had the crab crostini (good) but the linguine with seafood was kinda average with very little flavor.	3star
I really really like this place . It's like my second home . Now there's a new one but I miss the cocktail list from the old barn joo. They were legit cocktails even in happy hour. I want them back. And also the old happy hour food menu...grilled asparagus and stuff. Were so good. Otherwise overall very economical yet good quality of food and drinks . I will always recommend this place . Very chill.	4star
"We were there on a Sunday afternoon. The place was half filled. We ordered two beers to start. First problem. The incompetent waiter couldn't find the beer.  We waited and waited.  Finally he came back stating he's still looking.  My fiancé and I looked at each other in disbelief.  To aid the befuddled waiter., we changed the beer to another brand. After several minutes our beer came. We then ordered an appetizer to share (clams) and a main course each. One was veal with a cream sauce and the other was chicken with Spinach and mozzarella .  After about 25 minutes the calms arrived. For being called ""baked"" clams they were watery !!! Seems like the incompetence has spread to the kitchen too we thought. We did the best we could trying to finish the clams until we just asked the waiter to take them away.  Now for the main course.  From the time we told the waiter to remove the sorry excuse for baked clams. We waited 50 minutes for the main course to come out. After about the 35 minute mark, I called the manager over to the table. He asked how was your dinner ? I answered what dinner ?!!!!!!   I'm still waiting !!!  He seem genuinely shocked at the level or amateurism of the wait staff. He talked to the waiter. The waiter then went in the kitchen.  It's seems the ""waiter"" never told the chef to start the main course after the appetizer was served.  The piles upon piles of incompetence is endless in this place.  After we finished the main course my fiancé and I both agreed the food is below average.  My chicken was bland. Her veal was overly seasoned and overcooked. From the beer to the appetizer and main course. I can't say one good thing about this restaurant. Avoid it !!!   Next time I'm in Little Italy I will."	1star
Let me start off by saying that Maybe it was an off night for this place, but it was a real disappointment. It was around 10pm on a Tuesday and the staff was super friendly and didn't even bat an eye when I wheeled my daughter in her stroller through the doors. The food left much to be desired though and the beer, although tasty, was a little warm. We started with the scallion pancake, which was soggy and falling apart. Maybe that is supposed to be the consistency for here, but I always get nice flaky and crispy scallion pancakes, so it was a let down. The best part of the appetizers was the spicy kimchi. I had a pork bun and a fried chicken bun. The fried chicken tasted like it was microwaved, very dry and  no crunch. It wasn't good at all. The pork again, very dry and bland. I had to douse it with hot sauce to even be edible, and even then it was not worth eating. I will give this place another try bc like I said, could have been an off night.	3star
"Diego bar is not worth the time.  Bartender with the blonde shaved head is so rude.  Kicked me out of a seat I was told I could sit in because I was ""inconvenient"".  What a lovely way to refer to guests"	2star
We had too high of an expectation coming here considering the trek it took to come to LIC.  Want to avoid the lines? Come on a weekday at 5pm.  Recs:  + U&I. Ohhh the mashed tuna, uni, and ikura (salmon roe) on a bed of rice was divine. Tiny and pricey appetizer.  + Mu ramen and miso broths were alright. The oxtail + bone marrow broth combo is certainly different.  The bad:  (-) No egg included despite paying $16-$18/bowl.  (-) Miso ramen- their noodles are very thick and under cooked.  My bf raised a concern about it and they simply said it was their restaurant's signature characteristic. Now this is coming from a guy who baseline doesn't like his noodles too soft. Staff recommended either leaving the noodle longer in the soup or re-soaking it in boiling water.  Yes miso ramen is traditionally supposed to come with thicker noodles but they really shouldn't be thicker than lo mein. Only after my bf realized that one of the staff could speak his native tongue that we find out secretly that they've actually received several complaints already about the noodles being under cooked. Seems like they don't make much room available for improvement.   (-) Not a big fan of the table layout. Get comfy friends because their dining table is designed to look like 1 giant table. If you're a small party, you'll be sitting next to your buddy and opposite to a stranger. Not sure where to divert my eyes ya know? Even though we were the 2nd people to come in for their dinner service, we sat directly opposite to this lone gentleman.  Props to Mu ramen for trying so dearly to be unique in all aspects of their dishes and decor. Everything is visually beautiful. But some things seem a bit too far fetched.  1. They try to persuade you to purchase their gourmet apple juice that'll pair well with their ramen. Well that's a first for me. 2. Although we didn't order their okonomiyaki, from other yelper's pictures it has zero resemblance to the original thing. I'm a huuuge fan of this dish but the fact that it deviated so far from the original came to be a turn off. Mu Ramen is definitely a place for adventurists. Perhaps I'm too much of a traditionalist.	3star
I am very confused by other reviews here. We went with my jetlagged in-laws for the first time and ordered a few pizzas to quickly share and I don't think I have ever tasted anything as grotesque or similar to celeste or elios microwaveable pizza since I graduated college over a decade ago. It honestly tasted like someone took rubbery pita bread and put some toppings over it then tried to heat it up. Disgusting. I tried to joke/complain a little to the waiter about it and he ignored me as he was clearly aware of the problem and just could not deal. Worst pizza I've ever had served to me including in airports. Avoid!!!!	1star
Never before have I tried a lobster roll in my life until I tried it at Luke's Lobster; and I was NOT dissapointed! The lobster roll was bountiful with fresh buttery lobster, rested in a tosted bun, and seasoned very very well. The treat cost me 19 dollars and change after tax, and I'd say it was worth every dime! The woman working behind the counter informed my friend and I that they would soon introduce lobster macaroni and cheese to the menu, and I'm ready for it! I'll be visiting this hidden gem once again. By the way, I'm obsessed with lobster rolls now!	5star
Ate here with a friend a couple of months ago and let me just day their drinks are bomb! The food was great, tasted clean (like not oily or fatty) and I was pretty full after their downing their bibimbap. Highly recommend this spot.	5star
As good as the reviews, very flavorful. It's a small place. Recommend to come within 2 people during lunch time before 12:30 without wait to taste the food. Got the drunken noodle, probably the best Thai food i had here, considering how many different Thai places I have tried.	4star
My friend and I had always been meaning to try Seamore's whenever we passed by and had the opportunity recently to dine there. Without a doubt, the design and ambiance of the place is very enticing and exceedingly well put together -- it's clean, trendy, and a wonderful reminder of the small seaside restaurants. However, I felt that the food was rather disappointing and left a lot to be desired. My friends and I all ordered The Reel Deal, each ordering a different fresh fish from the menu. Sides were a choice of 2 from 3 options (greens, veggies, mash/grain). I ordered the Salted Mackerel with Red Curry sauce, along with quinoa and some steamed veggies. While the fish was fresh, the cut was rather small and a bit overcooked. The sauces were creative and flavorful but the sides were rather bland. Overall, for $23 the plate was reasonable. I very much wanted to love this place; their atmosphere, service, and emphasis on local sustainable partnerships were all great, but their food was dull and sub-par.	3star
I yelped an Italian restaurant and unfortunately this place doesnt have outdoor seating. I always imagined eating at an Italian restaurant outside and getting a nice view. If you want that then go straight to Little Italy. We went here cuz it was Yelpy and likely because it is near Time Square and this is where the tourists go. I got the squid ink pasta with seafood and the portion is hugeeee. The seafood wasnt very fresh unfortunately so I didnt finish the dish. I did enjoy the squid ink but there was just so much and I already carbed it up with the yummy bread. This place is a typical expensive Italian restaurant but I am sure you can find more authentic cuter places.	3star
Been going here for years... food is excellent and prices are great but portions are kind of small.  Overall one of my favorite asian restaurants in NYC	4star
"Came here at 10:20 PM on a Tuesday, didn't even get to walk in. Employee met me at the door saying ""were closing in 20mins"" which is odd, because in 20 mins it's 10:40, not even 11. On google and yelp, it says you guys close at 12. Never coming back here."	1star
Got take out. It was surprisingly good. Especially since its in such a random location, where there is nothing but industrial buildings around. But thats LIC for you.  They were friendly, and pretty quick. Would definitely get take out from here again.	3star
Came in here after a long day of running around and on a completely empty stomach ready to eat some good Mediterranean food. The guy was shockingly stingy with every portion! Do not feel satisfied at all by the 4 pieces of chicken he gave me. When I asked for more, he literally put 1 more piece of chicken on the plate. I asked again and he said he would need to charge me $3 dollars for double meat. I didn't ask for double meat, I asked for a sensible portion of chicken! Really might have just encountered the wrong person but I definitely will be sticking to GRK and The Hummus & Pita Co. from now on.	1star
Pictures will deceive!!! Came in excited, left sad.  Burger was ok	3star
I ordered this on seamless so I can't speak to the in restaurant experience, but it was a solid 3. The beef enchiladas were tasty, but didn't pack as much spice as I'd expect, and I think it needed a bit more sour cream or avocado to cut the heavy sauce. What brings the review down we're the esquites, and I loved esquites. I've uploaded a picture for full effect, but the esquites came in a large container (great!) but soaked in butter. Typically esquites I've had have had a touch of butter, and then tons of cheese, cream, chili and lime. These ones were basically in a butter soup with a touch of the other toppings on the top only.  I have heard great things, especially about the outdoor seating, so I'll go back and try the elotes next time in person, rather than esquites via seamless.	3star
Came here on a Saturday night, the place was a bit packed and the ambience and music felt right. BUT they were very understaffed, causing the server/bartender (one person serving everyone) to be agitated by any request. This is not an efficient way to run a business given you have customers who choose to come in and spend money at your restaurant instead of others around, they deserve your time and attention and not to feel as if they are a bother. The bus boy (I believe he was Mexican, just to be specific as to who) was not polite, requested a straw and 10min later when I reminded him he gave a face and was irritated to grab it then when we tried to get his attention for a question he told the server/bartender (reminder there was only ONE) to go answer us, as if he couldn't be bothered to grab us napkins meanwhile the server was already completely tied up. The food and drinks were pretty good here, but the service was horrible therefore 2 stars it is because nowadays with all the competition out there in NYC customer service matters a lot	2star
Don't recommend anyone especially Asian to eat in this restaurant. My friends and I get insulted by the so called comedian tonight. The MC found out we were Asian sitting there and ask us where we from. We told them we are from Hong Kong and thought we were being welcome because we visited this Latin American restaurant. Then the comedian Kim on the stage starting to put Our race down and talk really bad about our race.  We were very angry and left. Our night was ruined! BTW: it Took half an hour to just reheat the steak and the service is not that good. It's a really bad experience!	1star
I came here for a birthday dinner and I was so disappointed. We went home unsatisfied. It was a Friday night, the wait to the table, getting entree and dessert was the longest ever. The server never checked in on us through out the dinner to see if everything was okay... The food was good, service was not fine dining. Wouldn't recommend on a busy night or for a special occasion.	2star
"I went to Juliana's the day after I had Lombardi's. So what is this, my second real New York pizza? Four stars cause I'm saving my five for a pizza that truly gives me a foodgasm. Going here gave me one of those divine realizations as to why New Yorkers are known for folding their pizza. Before, (I'm sorry) I scoffed at this practice. ""You eat it faster!"" I'd say. I'd grumble, ""Makes the pizza too thick!"" But when the pizza is so thin... as it was here and at Lombardi's... it becomes a necessity. Cause the thing is just too flaccid to--- er. It gives the pizza some structural integrity. So now I'm a fan of the fold! If you're lucky, go sit at the bar. There are five magical seats there that give you a front row view of the guys & gals preparing your pizza. For coziness' sake, they even have the names of your pizzamakers on a little chalkboard by the oven. One man even threw the dough to his coworker, who proceeded to spin and thin it out. If you watch him long enough you can anticipate it and get you slow-mo Snap ready. Fiancée and I ordered a large half-white, half-margherita with pepperoni (Small and large both have 8 slices, btw!). At first I grumbled to her for picking such a basic topping but this pepperoni was far from it! This ain't your grocery or chain variety. This one's special. So judge not by the name and try it, at least. Margherita ended up being the preferred side (sauce was so right... and it looked mouthwateringly delicious), but the white pizza was good too (garlicky but good!). They take card too, so no need to seek an ATM! Only bummer was the size of the Coke. It came in a super tiny bottle. Great if you're tryna watch your calories. Not great if you're trying to down four pizzas."	4star
This is my new favorite Thai restaurant! I love everything about this place- the décor, the ambiance, the food. Everything. I made a reservation for two on a Monday evening. It was pretty crowded even though we came at 8pm. They seated us right away and were very friendly. The servers were attentive and consistently refilled empty water cups.  First of all, let's talk about the décor. The place is decorated so beautifully- it has cute lit up, colorful lanterns. The lanterns lit up the dimmed room so perfectly. It created a romantic atmosphere that is perfect for date night! My date and I ordered the curry puffs and thai crepe dumplings. The curry puffs had minced chicken, potatoes, onion, and curry powder. It's served with sweet cucumber relish which complemented the dish well. The thai crepe dumplings were also very good. It has minced chicken, peanuts, and sweet turnips. This dish is served with a sweet soy sauce that completes the dish. For the main dishes, we ordered green curry with chicken and the Up Thai seafood claypot fried rice. The green curry here is AMAZING. It's the best green curry I've ever had. The flavors were perfect along with the chicken that is cooked just right. The green curry also includes bamboo and tender eggplant. As for the claypot fried rice, it is also super delicious. The rice had a chewy consistency and the seafood is cooked right. My favorite parts of this dish were the scallops, the shrimps, and the Chinese sausage. This dish is just a delicious concoction.  I'm still day dreaming about the food at this restaurant ever since I've had it. If I lived in New York, I'd go bankrupt because I'd come here for lunch/dinner every day. This place is incredible- check it out.	5star
I took my mother here for lunch and regret that I didn't choose somewhere else. We had a late lunch reservation and were seated upstairs toward the back bar. The restaurant was crowded but we had to ask twice for our waiter after sitting at our table for nearly 10 minutes. He finally got us water and dropped off menus. My mother ordered an iced tea, that never came. I had to ask two waiters for our waiter so that we could order. He finally came to the table at 2:30 to take our order (we arrived at 2pm). We ordered and about 5 minutes later he came back to our table to tell us that they ran out of chicken so my mother couldn't have the chicken salad. Ran out of chicken?!?!?  We finally got our food, which was well prepared but nothing special. My mother never got her iced tea.  Too many other great restaurants to waste a $120 meal on poor service and underwhelming food.	2star
This place is super unique. It's like a little piece of Mexico was picked up and placed in Brooklyn. Go in the summer and sit in the outdoor seating area that is decorated with colorful umbrellas, wall art, and streamers; it's super Instagram worthy. I loved how they had glass bottled sodas; they always taste better that way. My chicken burrito was banging as well. Downside: cash only. Other than that, totally worth checking out!	4star
We came here Friday for happy hour and it was just too crowded and so hot! I don't think this place is really a place for food- more just drinks and sweat. The crowd was young and interesting. I think everyone just comes for the $6 lychee martini but it's small, so?? I guess that's NYC for you. My coworkers and I definitely won't be coming here again.	2star
The food is really mediocre, I gave it a couple of chances. The atmosphere is great, more of a bar ambience. I didn't try drinks, can't comment.	3star
This place is perfect! The food, ambience and service are world class. We start off with onion rolls dipped in sauce, shrimp cocktail, tomatoe and onion and bacon. After that, it's steak, fries, onion rings, spinach and grilled onions. My favorite desert is the sundae but there's no better streudel or pecan pie anywhere.	5star
If you have motion-sickness and have never been on a boat before and want to experience the boat atmosphere without stepping onto one, this is a great place to be.  I felt like i was in a boat, the entire restaurant resembled the inside of a boat, from the port hole doors to the sun-roof type dimly lit windows on the ceiling and keep in mind this is in the basement.  Whoever designed it, did a very good job to replicate the boat experience.   It is quite noisy in here but not to the point you cannot have a conversation.  The lighting is not that great, meaning it's pretty dark in here.  Another great aspect is you will not be rushed out of this place, we had a party of four and choose the restaurant week menu and it took us almost two hours to get out of here, they take their time in bringing us everything.  So if you are really hungry, you may faint waiting for your food.   There is no seating unless everyone in your party is present.   We ordered various items from the restaurant week menu.   Lure raw bar tasting (2 east coast oysters, 2 west coast oysters, 2 shrimp dipping sauces) - oysters were pretty small, tasted very fresh, the 2 shrimp were overcooked.   Lobster fra diavolo ($10 supplement)(squid ink tagliatelle, shrimp, calamari, spicy tomato) - the spicy tomato sauce was really good, very flavorful, the shrimp and lobster was a bit overcooked.    miso glazed salmon (sugar snap pease, shitake mushrooms, toasted sesame seeds) - pretty regular dish, salmon was juicy.   sushi combo (6 pieces of sushi & 1 maki roll) - we had one order with yellowtail & scallion, and another with a special roll - king crab California supplement $6, having sushi here is kind of unusual, but the fish tasted pretty fresh.   Warm chocolate cake (chambord sauce, white snow, vanilla bean ice cream) - just didn't fit my palette, flourless cake tasted weird and there was not much chocolate oozing out from the center.   Service was good, the guy checked up on his often. Glance at the regular menu indicated much more options at much higher price points.   Overall, the atmosphere and decor were awesome, but the restaurant week food was just ok.	3star
"I had ""dinner"" here and really was underwhelmed. The plates are tapas-style. I ordered the calamari, a spiced wing dish, the lo-mein, and steamed Dublin. The dumplings and calamari tasted as though they were previously frozen. Yuck! The wings were OK. I enjoyed the lo-mein mostly but even that was mediocre."	1star
Usually food is consistent, but today I got the N1 spicy lamb in ribbon noodles, and it got to me cold. I gave it back and I got back a dish that was hot but I could tell the ingredients were not fresh. Onions left a weird after taste. Maybe its just the chef on Mondays.	3star
This is a Korean restaurant with Japanse food. Although the dishes tastes good, the portion is really small. I would prefer to have normal portion for every dishes. I recommended yakitori tashio on st. Marks. At least I know I won't walk out hungry.	2star
The bee sting is to die for. I haven't even explored too much of the rest of the menu.	5star
Mu ramen is a cute place 2 blocks away from the Vernon subway stop so it's fairly easy to get to from where I live. We ordered the fried chicken stuffed with foie gras, okonomiyaki for starters and both were great! As for ramen I got the tonkatsu and spicy miso and these were good as well. It's a great ramen spot but a bit pricy.	4star
(YC2017, 69/100) Located in the Financial District (obviously), I stopped by for a quick lunch on the weekend and it was pretty dang good.  The prices were a little high for the size of the roll, but its seafood, so it's expected.  We got the shrimp roll ($13) and lobster roll ($17) and they were both really good.  The roll itself wasn't as buttered as I usually prefer, but the lobster pieces and shrimp tasted fresh and the portions were decent - left me not full, but definitely content.   The ambiance of the interior kind of makes you feel like you're on a boat, so it really plays into the type of food they offer.  Service was nice and friendly and I would come back if I were ever in the area again.	4star
Tuk Tuk has an exciting menu that is different from a lot of the other thai places in nyc but it fell flat of my expectations.  Roti massaman: the roti was ok but the massaman curry dip was too sweet for my liking. My friend has a peanut allergy and the after informing the staff that he was allergic to peanuts after we ordered our dishes, they did not mention that we shouldn't have this (so either they forgot this had peanuts in it or they didn't care).  Pad see ew: It was very sweet and lacked seasoning- it was so bland. The shrimp in it was fresh and delicious though.  Mee kiew hang: the egg noodles in the like vinaigrette was delicious. Unfortunately the rest of the dish was terrible. When I bit into the wonton I felt like I couldn't taste anything- maybe they were sitting in the freezer for too long. These were the worst wonton I've ever eaten. The roast pork was rubbery too. I wouldn't order this again.  Kua gling: the beef was tender but this was not anything special. Tasted like they just put red curry paste in beef.	2star
Worst service I've ever experienced! The waitress was ok, but the 2 hosts were as cold as ice! The food was ok but not worth going back because of the people who work there.	1star
"the place is really nice looking, medium size and quite, we were 4 people out of 8 in the whole restaurant, the menu look bad and not inviting but the food is good+, the waitress was nice but she had some strict rules from her managers and it was sad ones...one of my friends didn't like her dish, after one bite she ask to replace it but the waitress said: ""there is no exchange"" and refuse to help my friend....I don't blame the waitress but the owners should be ashamed. other than this the alcohol prices are nice...a bottle of beer costs $5 and with few good kinds to select from, if you're around (it's really distant from other places) and want some good food and a beer with no exchanges :-) this is the place."	3star
Food was not worth the price or the bug in my water. Too bad I used up a meal here while on vacation.	3star
"My girlfriend and I went to Upstate tonight to have a higher class finer than we were used to. We looked at other reviews on here and we're convinced.  The place had a little wait on a Friday at around 9pm. We put our number down and got texted at 9:20. Very okay with us! Inside it is very cozy and intimate. We were given seats at the bar. The place is so small we said sure, but seats are seats.  When we sat down we were given an oyster menu and the regular menu. We don't know much about oysters but the bartender helped us out. There were about 9 or 10 beers on draught. Good selection.  The menu was small but expansive. We ended up ordering 8 oysters, lobster ceviche, the plate of day (swordfish), and the Majority Shark.  All of these were absolutely amazing. The oysters were shucked perfectly and tasted great. The ceviche was brought out very quickly and was delicious. Came with some magic salsa of some sort and other garnish.  The entrees came out on cute plates and smelled amazing. It was great we could see into the kitchen as well. My girlfriend's swordfish wasthe perfectly cooked as well as my Mako. I had never had Mako before and honestly the taste was unbelievable. It is now my favorite type of hot fish.  I actually had heard great things about the scallops as well so I asked the bartender if I could get an order of 2 so we could try. This is not on the menu but they accommodated us when we asked! To our surprised they actually played the scallops on top of their mushroom risotto, which is an entree. It was just a mini portion. They only charged us $6 for the addition. The scallops were PERFECT. I have never had a better scallop. Crispy on the outside and perfectly cooked inside. Amazing. After the food was taken away we were offered poundcake as a pallet cleanser. They also gave us a free ""shot"" of a milk Stout to accompany it! Also as an FYI for anyone with a gluten allergy, my girlfriend has one and the bartender was aware of what had gluten and what could be made without gluten. The soy sauce is gluten free.  Overall, this is a 5/5 for me. I usually don't go out to places like this but I have been to a few good ones. The vibe, the freshness of the food, and the reasonable prices for the quality ($18 for an entree), and the actual amazingness and tastiness of the food warrants this rating."	5star
I was very dissatisfied with the service I received, the food is always good but of late I've been experiencing unreasonable lateness . I ordered my food at 7:45 and didn't receive it until 10:30 this is completely absurd	1star
We had a reservation for 730 but we had to reduce by 1 and they had no problem. We also asked to be seated in their outside area which was much cooler in temperature and had individual chairs instead of benches.  The drinks were quite strong yet balanced. Most of them were spicy, which complemented most of the dishes.  We were advised to order the dishes all at once so that they would come out together to enjoy family style.  We instead ordered separately so that they would be hot as well as not having all the flavors meld together and taste the same.  Our server was ok with it and we had the grilled octopus (tender), pork belly with Brussels sprouts (light on the belly), prawns (crispy and briny), pork jowl (Our favorite based on the crispness and richness from the egg), sirloin  (surprisingly tender), and the hainanese duck (not really simple broth style).  The portion sizes are small but are good for sharing for no more than 4 people unless you make multiple orders. It is definitely prepared well and a great time.	4star
"Here's the thing about Cafe Rue Dix:  The food is pretty good, although a little heavy on the spices and spicy side throughout their dishes to the point that the ingredients themselves get a  bit lost.  The price for the portion sizes are also inflated.  I've come here several times for happy hour, and usually order the hibiscus margarita.  It is good!  Well balanced with the sweet of hibiscus and the sour of the margarita, although the liquor gets lost (could definitely be stronger).  The first time I came here, I got the HH burger with fries.  Fries were delish.  Piping hot, cripsy and non-greasy.  The burger was also pretty good, although I found the spices in the ground beef to be too heavy ant it overwhelmed my palate after awhile.  Another time I came and got the cheese board.  I had misread and thought the price was ""$13"" not ""$18."" My bad.  When the cheese board came out, I was disappointed by the cheeses.  One was a bleu, which was good and paired with a jam of some sort, and I believe a comte and gruyere, which really tasted the same.  The plate also had some soft goat cheese which had a good funk to it, and the last cheese was something I couldn't identify and did not care for at all.  Too stinky/funky/and crumbled weirdly in a non-appetizing and grainy sort of way.  The bread that accompanied the cheese tasted like it had sat out to be staled for at least a day, and there was a small tin of about 4 olives.  Not impressed, especially for a price of just under $20. Another time, I thought I'd try the actual entree, especially since the previous time I had come, two people sitting on either side of me had readily ordered the grilled branzino with cous cous.  The dish is a whole branzino, head, tail and all.  This did not deter me, as I often like whole cooked fish, and it came on a sizzling skillet with sauteed onions covering it and a bowl of a side of cous cous.  The fish was cooked perfectly, although word of warning to those ordering: IT IS FULL OF BONES.  Once I saw the whole fish, I could have expected the bones, but did not know upon ordering it that it was a whole fish!  I spent a good 1/3 of my time picking bones out of my teeth until I could strip the carcass of the spine (having grown up in northern MN, butchering/deboning a fish is second nature to me!).  The lemon that was on the side was much needed since, again, my palate got overwhelmed by the dry spice that was rubbed on the fish.  My mouth was on fire, and it wanted a relief of some sort!  Such a beautiful fish, and it got drowned in spices.  The cous cous was very disappointing.  Just cooked and fluffed, no seasoning or anything.  Where the fish was overly seasoned and spiced, the cous cous was bland. Here's the kicker:  even when I order happy hour items exclusively,  I have yet to be able to walk out without spending at least $45 for dinner and a drink.  Being that we are so close to Franklin Ave, you can find tastier items that will cost a significant less.  Nevertheless, the convenience of the place will get me to keep coming back."	3star
I came here with my food partner since it was highly rated on yelp and he likes soul food. We came on a saturday night and I guess it was highly recommended to make reservations..? We went and had to wait ~20 minutes which isn't too bad. But if you plan to go, call and make reservations because they get busy. I ordered the shrimp and lobster grits which was good. There were 3 pieces of shrimp but they weren't the tiny ones and they were flavorful. We also ordered the famous mac&cheese. Andddd it does not disappoint. It is a side dish but I think its big enough to eat as an entree. It was baked, cheesy, goodness.  My boyfriend ordered the famous red velvet waffle and fried chicken. I didn't get to try but he seemed to enjoy it. Nonetheless, the mac and cheese was the best thing there. We were able to find parking so dont let the fear of not finding parking deter you from here.	4star
I may be a little bias on my review here due to the condition of the weather on the night that I had dine here, but I couldn't even finish my food because it was so damn hot and the staff didn't even turn on the AC. Instead they had all the windows opened so all the hot air can circulate among everyone eating in the restaurant.  Food wise, it was okay. Nothing different or special I found from my meal and the price is fair for what it had to offer. Won't be revisiting this place again though, MAYBE if I'm desperate in the winter time where I can probably then finish my meal without sweating like a mad man...	3star
This was my first time trying a Himalayan restaurant, and it was okay. I was not very adventurous and got the chicken tikka masala with onion naan bread, but it was great Indian food. My friend got a traditional Himalayan chicken curry that came with buckwheat flour pancakes, vegetables, and pickles. The curry had a really strange flavor that we did not like and the pancakes were really hard and tasteless. We also tried their steamed momo dumplings which were nowhere as good as Chinese soup dumplings or other dumplings. It was a fun experience, but I probably would not return.	2star
This was the best ramen I have ever had in my life. I ordered a spicy bowl with no mushrooms and it came out within 10 mins. The wait was even shorter than expected. The only that was I guess was the super close seating to other parties. My favorite part was the noodles.	5star
Very thoughtfully laid out in decor in every way.  The furniture and bar are beautifully finished and everything seems to work together to compliment the whole. (the large Sea Witch mural , the curved facade of the entrance)  The ceiling lights are large woks that have the constellations drilled into them.  The ceiling is painted a midnight blue and the effect is that of being inside a boat on the ocean at night.  The fish tank behind the bar gives the effect of looking out from  a portal out from the ship' s hold.    The menu is great,  very affordable foods of many varieties.    The beer list is very potent and eclectic !!	5star
What an amazing place to dine!!! Two nights in a row during a 4 day stay in NYC.  The food is absolutely spectacular from appetizers to desserts.  The staff was so friendly and social.  Dennis is one the best bartenders we have met.   1st night: Grilled Octopus: Three nice size pieces of grilled octopus, with Spanish green olives & baby potatoes. The olives created a great contrast with e sweet octopus and potatoes. Broccoli Rabe: This was the least insiping dish. Charred broccoli and pork chiccarones.  Lamb Ragu: Simply put AWESOME. So awesome that we ordered the Parpadele Bolognese. Papardele Bolognese: We were full at this point and we still cleaned the plate. Throw in a reasonably priced bottle of rose and of course desert Champagne Panna Cotta: Panna cotta topped with a champagne sorbet and a strawberry jam. WOW. Yummy for my tummy. 2nd night We just went in for drinks and desserts.	5star
I am not going to lie, I succumbed to the advertising forces of buzzfeed worth it episodes. Red Rooster's fried chicken was the worth it winner, so I decided I would drop the $27 and check out this infamous dish. It was a huge portion, but the dish didn't really remind me of fried chicken. I love the extra bits of fried batter goodness that surround the chicken  and unfortunately the layer of batter on this chicken was so uniform  ( which some people might like). The flavors were bold, and a lot sweeter than expected but almost too crazy for me.  But I have to say, I definitely have had better fried chicken for cheaper (for example, Jacobs pickles in upper west side).  So would I come here again, probably not. But I guess it's worth one visit if you are willing to check out some really intense flavor combinations.	3star
"Trying new places out often has two catalysts in my experience: 1) You're looking for a place nearby and you look it up on the Yelp app and give it a shot 2) You've heard about it from friends and they get super excited when you bring up the venue.  In the case of Extra Virgin it was the former which led to shades of the latter.  My girlfriend and I were looking for a place to eat in the area and this popped up.  We liked the way the restaurant looked and decided to check it out.  After I went and told friends about it, I got lots of exited gasps of ""You went THERE?!  Wow!"" which was reaffirming in a way I had not expected. But first, how as my experience? I've actually gone twice before writing this review, both times for dinner service.  The first time I went it was almost all empty, we had arrived a good twenty minutes before the dinner rush.  About the time we ordered and were getting into our pre-dinner conversation, people flowed in like a river.  The second time the place was jam packed, even at the bar.  Our larger party was told we had about a half hour wait, but we were very pleasantly surprised when that half hour turned into fifteen minutes.  In both cases the service was professional and friendly.  Kudos for that. Extra Virgin's setting is best described as contemporary and comfortable.  With lots of wood, but modern touches here and there like the furniture, one feels instantly at ease in this venue.  The restaurant is wide, with a seating area on the left side, a bar in the middle and then another seating area to the right.  Both times I visited I sat at the seating area to the right.  While waiting for my table, the bartender was gracious enough to help me charge my dying iPhone, special thanks to her for that. Both times I can say the waitstaff was very pleasant, knowledgeable and efficient.  The kitchen churned out dishes quickly, but they were beautifully plated each time.  They also check on each table regularly and a couple times I saw the manager talking to some regulars and checking with other tables.  He even asked me how everything was on my way out the second time.  Clearly this is a staff that is eager to please. Here are the dishes that I've tried so far: Roasted Butternut Squash Soup Featuring Parsnip cream, poached pear, gorgonzola crostini with a port wine glaze.  This was absolutely as delicious as it sounds.  The soup itself was very creamy and flavorful, with the right balance of sweet and savory.  The cream really added a decadent element to the flavor and texture.  The crostini was good enough that I found myself wishing there were about four more on the plate!  I had this both times I visited. Roasted Brussels Sprouts Cooked with caramelized apples and pancetta this dish really is stellar.  The sprouts themselves have a wonderful char flavor on them that is enhanced with the smokiness of the pancetta while balanced by the sweetness of the apples.  A wonderful side dish (again, I had this both times). Braised Short Rib Tacos These appetizers are a personal sized taco shell with vanilla whipped sweet potatoes, glazed onions, horseradish creme fraiche and pomegranate filled in with a wonderful short rib on top.  This dish has a sweetness that hits you first and then gets followed up by the savory flavors of the onions and horseradish.  It's a wonderful flavor combination, though be warned, like any taco hold it carefully or you may wind up with more of the dish on your plate than in your mouth! Lamb Three Ways Exactly as the name describes, this dish features lamb in the following forms: red wine braised shank, glazed chops and a kebab.  Accompanying the meats are a ratatouille, chickpea fries and a cucumber yogurt with pinot noir sauce.  I only got to pick at this dish a bit so I can't comment on all its components.  I will say the chops were the best meat on the dish, followed by the shank and then the kebab.  The chops were a bit small in my book, but they tasted really good. Mushroom Crusted Virgin Chicken Served with a sweet pea risotto, cippolini onions and truffle broth.  This dish defines savory.  Between the earthy flavors of the mushroom crust, the truffle broth and the onions, this dish is an exercise in non-sweet deliciousness.  The chicken was cooked perfectly, moist without any pink in the meat at all.  The risotto was tasty, but took a back seat to the meat (as I'm sure it was intended to). After telling my friends I went one time, we all went together and they too had a wonderful time.  This restaurant has definitely been added to my ""short list"" of venues to visit in the Village!"	4star
Brunch in Manhattan can get pricey. Especially for eggs and, well eggs in other variations. I've been here twice. Once on a slow weekday for lunch, and another time for Sunday brunch. The place is def over hyped. There is nothing that stands out or makes Jane special. The food is VERY mediocre...  My friends and I all got a few top brunch items: Eggs Benedict, Sicilian baked eggs, and Ranchero waffle. The waffle was overbearingly corny. Literally. It seemed a bit grainy and I did not enjoy that. The brunch menu seems to be shrinking from what I'm seeing on Yelp. You get a complimentary cocktail (which is weak) or juice with a brunch entree.  I'd suggest going to Astoria for brunch. Heartier and cheaper. It's nearly a tourist trap in the city.	3star
"A hole in the wall if there ever was one. The one and only reason I go is the boiled dumplings. I'm yet to have better dumplings in the city (or anywhere else for that matter). For a place with ""Handmade Noodle"" in the title, I expected better handmade noodles. Don't get me wrong, they're good, but I just have come to expect a little more. If all you want is handpulled noodles, I suggest you go to Xian's.  Also, ordering is a bit confusing and to this day, I don't think I've mastered it. It always works out in the end, it just usually takes about 15-30 seconds of awkwardly standing around.  If you want amazing, authentic-tasting dumplings, look no further."	4star
I've ordered from this Midland Chinese cuisine restaurant called Xi'an Famous Food (singular Food not plural Foods like this one here in NY) a few times in Philly before, I'm not sure if the two restaurants are connected or not, but here the stewed pork burger is way below my expectation. Both the stewed pork and the outside burger are very dry therefore hard to chew and swallow. It seems like the stewed pork has been reheated over and over again thus it's so dry. I've had better elsewhere in NY Chinatown, which is also cheaper than this one.	2star
¡MUY RICO! I bet the reason why they offer you gloves is to prevent too much finger-licking;) It is the best place to have Crawfish ever. (BTW, here is not a good place to date ur new boyfriend, unless you're sure he won't be surprised by your savage way of eating)	5star
Extremely rude front of house, said she couldn't understand my English in a very rude way - I'm British! Let 'friends' go before us even though we were clearly there before them. Would not come back here.	1star
"Your brunch order (excluding salads, sandwiches, and burgers) comes with a beverage (orange juice, passion fruit screwdriver, Bloody Mary, and one or two more options) for a price from $16 to about $22.  I came with my boyfriend on a Sunday at 12 and the quoted wait time was 40 minutes. Long and behold we were seated at 1240. Upon seating water and menus were brought out and after a few minutes this delicious raisin bread with this fruit butter spread came. We ordered a regular eggs Benedict ($18) and a prime rib Benedict ($22). The typical eggs benedict was a poached egg on this smokey flavored Canadian bacon (perfection) and English muffin. The whole dish was ordinary and what you'd typically expect (nothing distinct or special with that dish). My prime rib benedict was very unique. The poached egg was placed on top of a heaping amount of prime rib (tasted like plain old roast beef, it wasn't seasoned or anything) and hash brown! It was plated with a spring/arugula mix salad with a splash of tangy vinaigrette dressing. Great choice because after each bite of the Benedict it just got harder to deal with the oiliness of the hash brown so the salad was great to cut down the grease. Everything lacked flavor besides the yummy bread and butter. Oh and the ""complimentary"" drink that came with it... Lacking as well... besides the Bloody Mary! It was soo DELICIOUS! My passion fruit screwdriver was just juice to me :( . Came with high expectations but left disappointed. Apparently their French toast is amazing but I don't love eating sweets so had to pass just come here and don't get their benedicts"	3star
Something went wrong.  Something went terribly wrong.  Came in here for dinner on a Friday night. Was seated immediately. Service is wonderful.  I honestly am sad to write this review because my manhattan was freakin delicious and the lady waitingon us was so bubbly ane kind.  The food is terribly bland. Im not one for salty foods or anything but yeah, not seasoned at all.  There were three of us. One ordered a cheeseburger with fries, another ordered the special pasta for the day, and another ordered the special chicken schnitzel with mashed potatoes and salad. Every single thing we ate was bland. No flavor. I used the salt and pepper on the table liberally and was very disappointed.  If one of us had a meal that was sub par i would have said something to the server but everything on the table was bland. Bland. Bland. It wasnt worth it. We didnt wrap our leftovers. We didnt want dessert.  We won't be coming back for food... maybe drinks.  I really wanted to like this place.  But in the words of Randy Jackson, thats gonna be a no for me, dawg.	2star
The name sounds a little generic, but there are some solid items here. I'd recommend the soups over the stir fried noodle dishes, but both are a solid choice either way.  The Knife cut noodles are really quite good, and the serving sizes are very reasonable, especially in comparison to the price.  The duck is good, but I would recommend having either beef or lamb here.	4star
"Wonderful service from the reminder call about the reservation, the two hosts at the front desk (Kem and a lovely woman), Jacob my server and Brady the Som. Everyone went out of their way to make sure, as a single diner, that I had a wonderful experience. I was seated at the chef's counter with a full view of the kitchen. I ordered a glass of Sicilian red and Brady the Som poured me a sample of the white from the same vineyard as a treat. Oysters from RI started me off, super clean, cold and fresh. The sea bass main was great. I finished off with the, ""not to be missed"" S'more dessert. The whole time I was able to watch a well oiled kitchen ply their craft with a highly dedicated and talented chef leading the brigade.  Atrium is on a cobblestone side street that transforms you from glass and concret NY to old brick and stone."	5star
Wish I could give this place 2.5 stars. A bit of an awkward dining experience but the food didn't disappoint.  -Service Slow. We had a reservation and were on time but after we were greeted, we were left waiting, even though there were a couple of empty tables. We were given water right as we were sat which is always a move I appreciate. When the food started coming we didn't have silverware or plates (we said we would be ordering a bunch and sharing). Silverware was brought out but we had to give a reminder for the plates, which were really tiny. We also had to remind them we still needed one more dish. That being said, they're new, they were somewhat busy, and the food was obviously not sitting on the line under the heat lamps for a long time- so it came as it was ready. -Atmosphere Good. One guy who worked there talked shit about how all the new coffee shops look the same which I thought was funny because the restaurant looked just like the coffee shops he was bashing. Kinda played himself a bit. Overall though, I liked the atmosphere. They also have a backyard that looks pretty awesome. -Food Food was tasty. Menu was limited. We ordered everything they had available because they were out of some items. A complaint I have is that they served what are basically rice crispies as a side with their chicken choila dish. This was shitty. They should have used it as a topping in my opinion because nobody wants dry rice crispies for dinner as a whole side to a dish. We did leave kind of hungry but overall, satisfied enough. Price- Very good.  Overall- POTENTIAL. I think this place is a diamond in the rough. They have the skills, they just need some guidance. Nothing that can't be fixed with hiring a manager And bringing in a consultant to watch and critique.  Also, the owner's family owns Nepalese Restaurant down the street which is DEFINITELY one of my favorite places to get food from in the neighborhood. I have never left a comment like this. The only reason I did is because I think with a little help from the right people this place can be really great.	3star
So let me start by saying the drinks were pretty delicious, this place is wayyyy over priced. $14 for guac and chips??? The grasshopper taco was a bit to salty. They gave is guac that was brown, clearly not fresh, they sprinkled some cheese on there to cover the fact that it was not fresh. For 14 bux I better get fresh guac or I might as well go to chipotle. The table next to us had a fresh batch. Higher end restaurants do not charge $10 for dessert. I think the thing that turned me off the most was that the waiter didn't even wait for us to leave, she leaned over my friend and proceeded to clean the table. Will i be returning here, definitely not.	2star
Horrible customer  service... 3 of my friends came and seat at the bar... Bartenders werent busy at all but they care no pay attention to us. They clearly don't have a common sense of customer service ..  Treat others way you want be treated!	2star
Came here on a Labor Day weekend Monday around 2pm.  There was a short wait ~20 minutes. Ordered a the pork buns, Karaka-men, and the special ramen- I think it was called Karakachamen (?), and a couple of cocktails. Everything was delicious! The pork buns were possibly the best I've ever had... The karaka-men was nice and spicy, the noodles were straight and thin and well cooked. The karakachamen was a bit different- similar to a tan tan men- but not the same. BIG portions. Cocktails were super sweet, but after a few spoonfuls of ramen they were suddenly just the right sweetness.  This was my 2nd time here and I can't really remember my first visit too well, but this one was memorable. Still not my FAVORITE ramen place, especially for the price (at $15 it's the most expensive one I've reviewed so far), but it is GOOD, and worth the hype it receives. Might be back, but only if it's convenient.	4star
I came for the tavern burger based on reviews and it was very tasty. It came fairly quick when the restaurant was busy on a Friday. The service was great too; Alex (Alejandro? was my server).  The right balance of attentive but not over bearing. I ended up getting this specialty cocktail , the Okokie Dokie. A refreshing and strong drink for a summer evening. It's certain busy during early evening; the real feel of a popular spot.	4star
this was awful. Really  people of NYC you think this is a good falafel. Go to trader joes frozen section and pick up a bag  and it will be 100% better than this tasteless fried ball loaded with watery hummus lacking any kind of spice. limp,  wet iceburg lettuce. oh nyc come to la and have a real falafel	1star
3.5 star really. The atmosphere and decor is so cozy and I feel all warm inside when I walked in. The food took way too long to arrive and all we had was mac & cheese and a meatloaf sandwich. It wasn't even that busy.. So I had to wolf down my mac & cheese and run back to work. Does it really take that long to prepare mac & cheese? If you're not under time constraints, decent place to stop by for a decent meal. Boyfriend and I had brunch here as well for about $10/person. It was nothing remarkable.	3star
Babbo's food is all that you expect it to be and more. The food is delicious, it's sexy, it's served beautifully and without hesitation I say it's the best in the village. We ordered as if it was going to be our last meal. The pasta with lobster was a hit as well as the black spaghetti,  and pappardelle. We went on to order the carpaccio with black truffles, octopus, it's was ahhhhmaaazing. The pork chop was perfect, the scallops with truffle butter yummy, rabbit was awesome, ribs option could of had a little bit more on the plate it was divine. We ordered desserts that consisted of coconut cheesecake HIGHLY suggest you order it. Also, the orange chocolate and a flan type of dessert we had also but I forget the name of it. The only thing I would complain about was the waiter. We didn't know his name until the check came...it was Jonathan. He didn't crack a smile throughout our whole meal. He looked like he didn't want to be there he  was miserable. Awful. However, our man to help us with the drinks and table clean up was so bright and beautiful he made up for Jonathan.	5star
"We were very excited to try Hop Kee after hearing that Anthony Bourdain approves of the restaurant.  We passed it a couple of times and decided to try it.  The restaurant is below street level which threw us off a little bit.   When we entered, the restaurant was relatively empty and we were immediately seated.  The service was very attentive but not very helpful - we had a couple of questions about the menu which they seemed unable to answer.  We asked our server what his favorite dish was and he brushed us off; kind of a red flag.  The restaurant is a dive-y, no-frills sort of place.  We were given tea and white rice, and we ordered three items to share.  All of the food came out of the kitchen quickly.  First, we ordered the dumplings, which were disappointing.  They were served with this thick brown sauce on them, which looked delicious but was very pungent/bitter/sour.  The inside was weirdly crunchy. Secondly, we got duck mei fun, which was very good.  The portion was huge and I ate it for lunch for the following two days.  The only issue that I had was that most of the duck in the mei fun was actually just pieces of duck skin instead of the meat. Lastly, we ordered one of the ""special dishes"", the Fried Hop Kee chicken.  We were again disappointed, as the chicken was good but the sauce had virtually no flavor.  The veggies seemed fresh, though. All in all, especially for the price, you can find better food in Chinatown.  Our bill came to just over $40 for the three items, which is pricey for the area.  I personally would not go back."	2star
With over 1k reviews, I'm pretty sure that everything that needs to be said about Breakroom has already been said. My views about this place is pretty much in line with what everyone else has been saying. Get the tacos, get the fish taco especially. The mint lemonade is awesome, refreshing and perfect for cutting through the hearty Breakroom fries. That's all you really need to know. I lied, they have a wall of hot sauces, which is pretty cool and important at the same time. It's a small space so there's limited seating. The main reason I'm writing this review is the Breakroom fries. I love the Breakroom fries. Consider the rest of this review to be an ode to Breakroom fries because it's not just fries, it's more than that. There's a beautiful sunny side up egg on top of layers of fries AND tatter tots (because why would you ever want to choose between both). It's bits of bacon and pork belly with every bite and it's also covered in their special sauce. There's jalapenos and onions to give it a kick and this all just comes together so beautifully when you break open that egg yolk and let it spill over everything. That's it, I'm done. Get the Breakroom fries.	5star
Nothing exciting here. Can't understand the reviews at all. Slow service. Average food. I can't see any circumstances which would lead me back here. Not awful but sadly just no reason to ever return.	2star
I would rate their food a Five-Star...however this place is disturbing: - Broken / chipped containers served on table, is it against city codes, is this place responsible for cutting people up?  - I noticed there were at least 4 waiters and 3 buses were on the floor that time, each they took turns to our table and tried to collect our almost empty dishes , not to mentioning the interruptions but also that was extremely rude and annoying!	1star
Nah...soup dumplings bland and so so texture and taste. I still like Joe's better. Couldn't leave this review because it was toooo short soooo hoping this beautiful sentence is enough to post a review...there!	3star
Dineresque but definitely not diner prices. I noticed a lot of the more negative reviews involve the service, and while our server gets an an 'A' for effort, he still fell short. He was pleasant and helped with the description of dishes. After we put our food order in and I think he came to the table once more without me having to wave him over if I could catch him.  We got the oxtail empanadas, not bad but kinda small. They had kind of a sweet taste that was good but kinda drowned out the oxtail flavor. I ordered the Chuleta - grilled porkchop, spicy kale and grilled peaches. The porkchop was dry and overcooked. The Kale was just ok, didn't taste very spicy or seasoned. I also had some of the enchilada that had shredded chicken and rice and beans. Ok, but certainly not worth the $17 for the portion given and it was you know...average. You could get that off a spanish food cart and it be as good. This gives me the impression the portions are not that big and just average. The worst part was the length of time our food took, it took at least 40 min. The people next to us ordered the same time and theirs came 10 min faster, they finished their meal before we got ours. The excuse was they wanted to make sure my porkchop was not undercooked, well they failed at that. Lastly, my other complaint is the dimness of the resturant. I get that some are like that, but its hard to see in here and don't care for it. Maybe it was this one time, but I was caught off guard by the average of 4 stars for this place. If you're this highly rated and your menu prices are this high - $60 for two people - 2 courses (small and unimpressive), 2 drinks (bottled soda, juice) and 1 appetizer (let down) it had better be good and this wasn't.	2star
Food is good, meat is great quality, but I agree with some other comments here that this is one of the most overrated Korean BBQ. The wait is long and I don't think they do a great job keeping track so you have to keep checking in... We had the marinated beef platter, very good, but not really something to write home about. The spicy tofu soup, rice cake, cold noodles we ordered were very good.  Another thing that deducted the stars for me, was that I went home with hair and clothes smelling like BBQ...I know it's unavoidable, but I've been to places with similar price point and they give you a plastic cover -- talk about good customer service. And some other tables got so drunk and loud I could not carry on a conversation at my own table.	2star
Come to Fort Defiance for the smallest $16 hamburger this side of White Castle. Yes, the diner should have read the fine print and seen that this is an 8 oz. deal. But then again, who would expect such a diminutive dish served only with a half-dozen potato slices attached to such a price? No sauerkraut, no lettuce, no tomato, no brioche bun (as listed) and no luck if you have an appetite. The place is gemutlich enough and the staff friendly, but the menu needs work.	2star
Traif, Xixa's sister restaurant, is my favorite restaurant in NYC. I had high expectations for this restaurant, but unfortunately, my experience was disappointing. We found a shard of sharp plastic in our sangria, which would have been super detrimental had my husband swallowed it. It was a super dangerous situation, and they still charged us for it. I felt like they should have taken it off our bill. As for the food, it was hit or miss. I'd say half of the items on our pre fixe menu was great, the other half was more experimental on the restaurant's part and I didn't really like them.	2star
This was my first time having soba at a restaurant and definitely wasn't a good experience. Had the tempura hot soba regular size. Wasn't a fan of the hot soba. The broth was sour and the noodles were a bit soggy. The tempura was crispy but too oily and bland. Dipping in the broth made it also taste sour so that didn't quite help either. The oil used for the tempura didn't see that great either. Went home and got sick from the food. Won't be coming back to this place.	1star
Yuca Bar used to be soooooooo good!! I live in the East Village and always used to go there but the past few yrs the food has gotten blah and the drinks are ok. On top of that the new manager rushes people who are eating outside. The only thing I like about the place is the sangria and the empanadas... thats it. PS: They are not kid friendly. I went there with my baby cousin once and they sat us in the back by the bathrooms while the staff kept giving us the side eye.	3star
It's unfortunate that they are listed as a possible late night food eatery but as soon as I attempt to try out tasty tree...I'm lynched by the locked doors...hung from a tree, starvin Marvin...please call before you take a trip if it's a Friday after 12am...or else you will be left, locked out and hungry searching for a true late night eatery!!!!	1star
Japanese comfort food at its best.  It was a Friday night around 9 pm by the time our group of 5 got here and I was pleasantly surprised to see that it wasn't a typical, tiny EV joint where you are sitting shoulder to shoulder with other patrons. We ordered and shared all the dishes. Everyone was happy with the food. The standouts for me were the anchovy fried potatoes, kara-age and my wife's una-tama don.  Almost every Japanese place has kara-age on their menu these days but I think the ones here really stand out. I had the yakiniku don which was also very good but a bit on the sweet side. The soft shell crab with ponzu sauce was excellent as well.  The service was mostly good except that I had to hail them down for water almost 10 minutes after we were seated. They bought out the apps one by one so we could slowly go through them without rushing. The have a pretty good sake menu but because I had a residual cold I only got warm sake. It was very smooth. We didn't do dessert but I'm sure we'll be back very soon here. I definitely want to try their katsu don and curry.	4star
we came here after we found out the wait for Clinton St Bakery was going to be an hour and 30 minutes...i guess basic bitches really do love brunch. Thank goodness the wait for sweet chick was only 20 minutes or i would have lost my damn mind. the interior of the restaurant is cute, nice homey decor and cramped seating. i wanted to order the eggs benedict, but since it was my first time, i had to go for the chicken and waffles. i was told this chicken was better than root & bone, so i wanted to be the judge of that myself. the service was prompt. we were greeted by a really tall server with legs i only dream of having. the order came out pretty fast, and included 3 types of butter. i only ate the berry butter since it was the one closest to me (pretty good). the chicken was moist and tender and very crispy. i think it's on par with root & bone, but i still like root & bone better. the waffles though were very good. i'm generally not a huge fan of waffles, but these were crispy and light. the whole meal came to about 20 dollars a person, not too bad in my opinion.	4star
Visited on our recent trip to NYC ~ The food was very pricey and just ok, but the service was fabulous ~ #Loved Belle	2star
"Service - Horrible Food - Meh First off, our waiter was very rude for no apparent reason. Perhaps he was having a bad day, or maybe he's just a douche. He asked us ONCE if we were ready to order and we were not. He then disappeared for a long time and we flagged him down asking if we could order now. He rudely responds ""I've been here like three times and you weren't ready so now you can wait"" umm EXCUSE ME? Jerk. After that he was gone for a good 20-30 minutes (we had already been there 40 minutes), no exaggeration. Now for the food: No pasta menu besides the one special which includes spaghetti and gnocchi (uh isn't this an Italian restaurant? where's the rest of the pasta?!) Everything we had for dinner was pretty bland and after waiting for our food for such a long time I was turned off anyway. Never coming back."	1star
Hands down one of the best ramens I have ever had. Believe the hype. Broth was delicious. We were lucky to have been seated right when we got there in the middle of a weekday lunchtime.  Can't wait to try the one they just opened in NorCal!	5star
"Inauthentic, trendy, snobby wallet rape.  This noisy Thai/Filipino inspired hot spot on the west side sorely disappoints - yet another overpriced NYC restaurant where Asian cuisine has been mangled for a snooty crowd that will rave about pretty much anything so long as the deco is cool. For starters, khao soi is my most favorite dish from Thailand.  A creamy, curry noodle soup I relished during my days in Chiang Mai - the version here is a far cry from what I remember.  A salty muddled mess with some fried noodles sprinkled on top... And wtf is with the ""prawns"" - when I see that word I think of giant juicy shrimp monsters, not 3 puny critters from a frozen shrimp bag.  Shame on you for even daring to put that kind of price tag on such a limp appetizer."	2star
This is more a 3.5 stars than a 4. Food was great from the appetizers all the way to desert. But they took so long to do everything. Maybe 15mins to bring menus and ask what we wanted to eat and another long wait for the appetizers. Took us 2hrs from we were seated to finish eating and that's not because we were talking a lot. Other than long wait, service was good.	4star
This place is back! Had the pork dumpling noodle soup and it's as good as the old days. And at $7 for what feels like 2 meals in 1, you can't get a better cheap eat anywhere else. The new place is much larger and they have proper seating now, but like other reviewers said, there's a bit of a disconnect when coming up to the counter to pay. My friend and I had to wait for a while (5 or so mins?) while the staff were bickering about who should come up to the front.	4star
I really feel bad about writing this... just as much as my taste buds truly regrets being subjected to such tasteless Jamaican delicacies... This place should not be in Brooklyn. It would be better suited located somewhere like Ronkokoma, LI. Or you could compare it to terrible resort restaurant. The oxtails... horrendous, festivals... yuck, seitan... Meh, bok choy.. Ok, but I came for the peppered shrimp that was so much better a few months ago. Omg what is happening to Brooklyn, Jesus save us!	2star
We made reservations for 4 to celebrate my Daughters 21st Birthday and arrived at 5:30 PM on Saturday the 27th of May. We decided to try the tasting menu.  What a mistake!!, small portions, poor execution, poor service ( when we asked questions about where the fish was from, they changed servers)  No imagination in their preparations the best part of the meal was the chocolates at the end  Salmon was farm raised and lacked any flavor at all, lagastino was tough no flavor, all in all this was the worst value of a meal I have ever had. We had dined at Jean Georges for my Sons graduation and it was far above this place in service and quality.  If you want to throw your money away, go here One last comment, Beast in Portland OR has better flavors, a better experience, more imagination, and value than this place will ever have. If it was once good it has fallen way off. I wish I could get a refund	1star
It's pretty good, but the cost is not worth it! My sister and I ordered the kale salad, which comes with golden raisins, some kind of fried thing- fried kale maybe?, and a miso dressing- it was also $9. The portion was okay, I really liked the flavor of the miso dressing, but it was a little on the salty side and so the dish overall came off as salty. I really liked the contrast of the sweet raisins with the dressing. We also ordered the soy wings, which were also $9, and they were really delicious- salty, crispy, and juicy on the inside, and the portion was decent. Finally, we ordered a bowl of miso ramen with roasted pork, which was $15, imo, a little pricy. The pork was mostly fat with a little bit of meat- my sister loves pork fat, but she said that it was too much, even for her. The ramen had a nice flavor, but it wasn't anything special. I did like the poached egg that came with it though! Overall, our lunch came out to around $40 with tip, which is a decent amount for lunch, and that's not counting any kind of drinks. I think that while the food at Chuko is pretty good, it's also expensive, and I would keep that in mind if you were going to come here!	3star
So the food here is overall a 3/3.5. The ambience great. Portions are pretty generous. And cocktails were good too. Don't ever order the biscuits because they are hard and small. For some reason NYC can never get their biscuits right like they do down south. However, the jam that comes with the biscuits are quite lovely. This place is pretty packed so if you're going, do make reservations. If you don't mind sitting at the bar, it's pretty spacious and comfortable enough to enjoy your meal. Typical nice American place. Don't go expecting something beyond that.	4star
Their happy hour is definitely worth coming by to try! Its everyday from 4-7pm and their wine flights are a great way to end a workday off with. Me and a girlfriend went here after work and got the frederic wine flight that was composed of three white wines, all distinct in their taste for $12. So cheap!!! We also ordered all the crostinis available ($15) and escargot ($6) because what are you doing at a french establishment without snails??? As per the waiters suggestion we ordered the goat cheese ball ($6) as well and it came with a sack of bread. Yes. Literally a sack. It was so cute i wanted to take it home. I didnt get a chance to peep the regular menu but it is pretty pricy from my knowledge of french food in general and the aesthetic of this place keeps it old world which i love. We were handed our check with it being inside an old french book and I thought that was a great touch to the experience of dining here. The waiters and owner all speak french too so that's about as authentic as it can get in new york	4star
Granted, I work in the wine and spirits industty, so I'm basically a snob when It comes to that. And I didn't choose the place (nor would i). But the wine list absolutely BLOWS, spirits selection is mediocre, beer selection not much better. Basically everything is big brand and boring. Cocktails looked like different versions of sweet martinis (an oxymoron, you'd think). And personally I found the music loud and, granted, not my style. Apparently I'm too old and classy for a place like this. Bridge and Tunnel, enjoy	1star
The pork shoulder was good but not as great as I thought it would be. Their pickles were good. Benton ham was okay.	3star
The fried dumplings, scallion pancakes and congee are my go to menu items to order. Their congee is better than most places I've tried, fried dumplings are soo delicious as are there scallion pancakes (although I'd be pretty shocked if anywhere could mess up scallion pancakes) Customer service...they're not the best in this aspect. To sum it all up, they're all pretty rude, just different levels for every individual waiter/waitress. If they were to improve this, they'll probably get more business, or more tips to be more precise.  They offer a yelp check in 10% discount, Monday-Thursday and only in cash.  All in all, it's a good place to eat if you're in the area, but I personally wouldn't go out of my way to come here otherwise.	3star
"I came back today (Saturday) and wasn't wowed. At least I didn't have to wait: at 5:15pm there were plenty of tables.  The food was plenty, but the quality was just ok.  Papaya seafood salad: big portion, but boring taste; the seafood was clearly pre-frozen, and had no taste.  Larb with ground pork: just ok; the minced pork had a lot of tougher cartilaginous pieces that I couldn't chew.  Drunken noodles with sliced pork, although the meat was dry and tough, the noodles were good.  Sautéed crispy pork belly with chili, garlic and basil leaves: although the flavor of the pork belly was good, you could tell that it had been cooked earlier, and waited for a while.  Ripe mango with sticky rice: delicious.  Their house red wine (1/2 liter for $9) is pretty good, and a true bargain.  Overall, I'm not sure it's worth to come here anymore. Even though they give you a lot of food and have a lot of choices, they have so many dishes that it's impossible for them to cook them expressly for you... and it tastes accordingly.  I have a personal attachment to this place, and will probably end up coming back (but not for a while). However, I wouldn't wait to eat here. It's just average quality Thai ""comfort"" food, way too popular than it should."	3star
"I like it ... Nice scenery good over all food, staff not so friendly .. Seems to be a girl with some kinda hipster attitude that don't seem inviting to a West  Indian restaurant. She gave the impression that I was in the wrong place at the wrong time and I'm west indian, so you could imagine the look on my face. This was 9 o'clock at night, when everyone in Williamsburg was doing their thing you know what I mean so I took my order to go ... Came back to try another day during my lunch break and the service was much more inviting sat outside on a bench and was treated with respect but there was only like 3 people there if you know what I mean  ""Williamsburg"" huh ... ""Anyways"" the bake and shark is delicious (hot sauce, tamarind and shallow beny) worth the try. Everything else on the menu looks unappealing to me ... I asked for doubles and they don't serve it ""wow"" lol is alright tho ... Outside seating, nice music, cozy atmosphere. Good try but needs improvement. And the Drinks  are watered down for me however if you catch my drift. Tried the curried conch and rice because their cook is probably a non trini and don't know how to make dumplings ... It was suppose to be dumplings I wanted dumplings not white rice seesh get it together !!!!"	2star
Move over sour cream here comes lebneh. I honestly just said - what do you recommend?! And then get overwhelmed with all the responses or intrigued that the waiter wouldn't know by instinct what to get. But I truly Don.t mind and answer - surprise me.  And to my delights erythema was tasty- middle eastern twist w well well very well seasoned dishes. I liked it if not loved it. Can't wait for the g train to extend to this part of gpt. Just kidding.	4star
Went here for Saturday brunch. Place is not busy as I thought it would be. Absolutely no wait time. We were a group of 5 hungry girls and ordered pretty much the entire menu: Boar Tacos ($15) - THE WORST, do not ever order. 3 pieces of soft tacos full of scrambled egg Wings - average. Don't get extra dipping sauces ($0.50/each), it's all watered down  Chicken and waffles - average Biscuits & gravy - gravy! tasted old and newly microwaved. There were gravy lumps everywhere The best thing about this place is the Arnold Palmer ($3), but even that, they put way too much ice that drank the entire glass in one gulp. Seriously. I'm thinking it has four stars because of the drinkers? Or perhaps, the dinner chef is much better. All I know is I'm never coming back.	1star
We came late in the afternoon, so a few items were sold out and the brisket meat was dry. Might be worth another try at a time closer to the start of a rush. The Cole slaw and fufu were good.	3star
Went here on a double date during the Sunday brunch hours, and my goodness people! The food and service was spectacular! We ordered the red velvet chicken and waffles. It is to die for! My crew and I talked so much that the staff kept coming to check on us and making us laugh.  Although I think we were really overstaying our welcome because the brunch hours are short and people were waiting outside. Yes there was a line! The manager finally came out said we really love you guys but it's about that time. Oh we knew and laughed it off.  This is THE perfect brunch spot for a beautiful sunny day in BK! And the staff is so welcoming. I love the fact that it's all black male staff, they are all really fine folks!	5star
I must admit that I am pretty disappointed with my latest visit.  I always like to try a place twice before giving it a lower star and rating just in case they were having a off day.  The first time I went I thought it was mediocre I thought that the crab roll was good but now $12 worth. I went again today and order the crab roll and while it does have a lot of crab meat in it (seems string like the Cannes version) I found it to be a little too, hmm, idk how to even explain it. Too much crab kinda.  Usually I wouldbt like mayo on a crab roll but this one kinda needs something added to it.  I also ordered the crab blt since I heard great reviews.  Took a few bites and threw the rest out (I ate the bacon of course).  Totally overhyped and overpriced.  I don't think I'll return here unless it's to try the crab legs and the tab is on someone else.	2star
"Cash only!! There's an ATM available by the entrance next to the host, but it charges $2.50 to withdraw. You can get a large bag of shrimp and crawfish ~$25 (ideally split among two people) which left us full. The other combos include crawfish and lobster and also crawfish and crab.  The combo also came with potatoes and corn, plus you can customize and select the seasoning and spicy level (we did mild). The BBQ shrimp appetizer was delicious and came with crunchy, well-seasoned fries and cole slaw. I devoured the fries, which filled up half a plate. The staff here are incredible; they cater to your needs and make sure you are taken care of. They tie plastic ""bibs"" around your neck and give you a set of clear blue plastic gloves to wear. The table comes with a steel bucket to dump any shells and miscellaneous trash. The table is covered with brown, cardboard-like paper and removed at the end of your meal. The staff gives you plenty of napkins and lemon-scented hand wipes! The drinks here are strong and tasty; mostly $12+ per cocktail. I loved the peach lemonade, Saint Mojito and the Bloody Mary was a tiny bit spicy but tasty and rimmed with Old Bay seasoning (or similar spice). The staff are very attentive and clear out empty dishes and buckets (to replace) right away!"	4star
It's something chill to do on a warm summer night  I went there on a Tuesday night it wasn't too crowded like I usually see it crowded on a Friday night  2 drinks and 2 meals came down to $35 not bad  The staff is nice and friendly the food was good fresh and made to order  I will go back  The only bad part is they don't accept cards	4star
I go almost every week dude, mostly on weekdays around 9:00 pm for the happy hour dealx.. Japanese BBQ, Sake and Beer...  Can't go wrong.	3star
This place is nearby work, so it's always a common place my coworkers and I go to. They have the best congee and that's mostly what we come here for. I've had two different rice dishes (curry and something else) and it was just okay. Their XLBs are great! They don't taste like it's filled with MSG, but more of a fresh homemade style. I would stick to their congee and XLBs if you want to try this place. Oh also, if you like wonton noodle soup, their wontons are big!  If ordering takeout, i suggest calling ahead. They're usually busy during lunch times, even on weekdays and  will take about 15-20 minutes or so to have your order ready. Bring cash unless you plan to order over $25 since that's their cc limit!	4star
Absolutely horrendous service (waitress didn't write down our order and then never brought something we asked for, when we told her she claimed that we didn't order it), TINY portions--- we left still hungry and had to buy some more food, lackluster food. Overall a MAJOR disappointment and am not satisfied in any way whatsoever. I would assume that paying $16 for eggs would get you something that fills you up but that isn't the case.	1star
This is a very nice looking place. They have all the accoutrements and trappings of a great restaurant. Unfortunately, the food is terrible. I'm not a picky person at all and I couldn't even eat the food. I got the chorizo salad and it was so greasy I couldn't choke it down. My friend got the Caesar salad with chicken and it was very sour and overpowered by the sardine taste. On top of all that the server- who was otherwise very nice- lied to me and told me there is a freeze on licenses being issued for playing live music in NYC restaurants. As i am a musician and this is my livelihood, i began researching this right away and found no evidence to support this claim (thank goodness because again, that's how I live). Please tell the truth or at least a believable lie!	2star
Zero stars .... Alexandra is not a good waitress... She is very forgetful and we had ask for everything twice ... She practically refused to bring us ranch with our wings. Why? I have no idea ... Food is not that great either. Will not be back here again! Too bad I had to travel here from Cali to experience this. Hopefully the big apple has more to offer than places like this. Btw thus was my Father's Day lunch :(	1star
The decor at Thai Villa, is impressive, from The Buddha water fall at the entrance to the  hanging golden leaves in the dining area. The lighting creates a wonderful, intimate atmosphere.  We were seated immediately upon arrival although, they asked if we had a reservation and we replied that we did not, they still found a table for us. The staff is very kind, and attentive.  Upon being seated our server brought the huge menus over and throughly explain what are the recommended dishes, the traditional dishes, and the Thai imported spiced specialty dishes.  After we placed our order, another server came to hand deliver complementary appetizers. Photo will be included. I believe he said it was a chocolate bean curd, over pineapple. I honestly can not recall the exact description as to what else was in it but it was yummy.  I ordered the curry Puffs as an appetizer, the chicken pineapple fried rice & a Thai iced tea. My husband ordered the chicken pad Thai and a soft drink.  Everything was great from the service, to the food, to the beautiful decor, even the restrooms are very nice but most importantly well stocked and clean.  Great place for a date, or a small group dinner. Prices are moderate, food portions are plentiful.  I say check it out for yourself,  I think you will enjoy!	5star
This place was voted to have the best pizza in NYC and boy they did not disappoint. I got a bottle of their cheapest white wine and there's no complaints there. The staffs are very attentive and will do as much as they can to customize your pizza the way you want it. The minute you take the first bite, the world just slows down around you as that cheese and dough melts in your mouth. Delicious.	5star
Pretty solid pizza place. Can have a line. We wanted something close to the Brooklyn bridge and this was the place.  If we wouldn't have gone to Bleeckers first then I might have bumped this up a star rating. It was a solid sit down dining option. Service was great. We liked how you could see them making the pizza dough.  We tried the Margherita pizza and then that with pepperoni added. It was a pretty decent plain pizza. The slices of pepperoni were good as well.  We also tried a No. 6 chicken with guacamole. Now at home I make unique pizzas but I didn't care for this one.  The final one we had was a No. 4 the prosciutto was really good. And the added argula on top was different but very popular with our group.  We absolutely loved the egg cream Brooklyn style drink. Seltzer water with heavy cream (or something like that). Creamy and delicious. $3.50	4star
"Brunch at Beauty & Essex was quite an experience. From the prompt service to delightful ambiance, I truly enjoyed brunch there.  The food was absolutely delicious, but the portions were miniature for the prices. All of the dishes are meant to be ""shared,"" but 6-8 dishes are necessary to serve a 4 person party. The dishes worth ordering are the red velvet waffles and eggplant pizzeta. The mac & cheese was a twist on the classic, not my favorite, but still tasty. Also at $17 a mimosa, this is not the place for a boozy brunch. While the food was delicious, the prices are exorbitant, so I am unlikely to return."	3star
I have been to gargiulos many times. however, i have found that the menu has changed and many of the old standbys no longer exist. they used to have fabulous lasgna and manicotta. I wonder if they disappeared because they weren't bit dollar items.. the food lately is not something i would write home about.. it was okay.. definitely not great. the service was beyond slow.. i suspect they didn't have enough staff... it was amost as if the waiter disappeared into the great beyond.. at times he diefiniely forgot about us. I also thought it was expensive for what it was. btw... there are now bottles of house wine.... we had the pinot grigio... which was decent.. watch what you order if you want to keep the price down..	2star
Third time is a charm when it comes to actually getting a table at this small restaurant. I tried coming here two other times and the wait was over 2 hours. Finally, on this fateful night, I was able to be seated within 30 minutes with my party of 4. Safe to say, i was pretty excited to finally try the food here. Unfortunately, I wasn't super impressed.  Appetizer: We ordered the tuna tartar tower which we saw on another table. The presentation was beautiful, in a nice little cube with layers of tuna, mountain yam and avocado. However, it lacked flavor and seasoning.  Entree: I ordered the Kitsune which comes with fried bean curd, fish cake and boiled spinach. The soup itself is very light and not at all like the meat broth I've come to expect from ramen. The noodles itself was a bit tougher than ramen noodles but well made. The bean curd was soggy in my soup and the fish cake was tiny. Overall, very muted flavor profile.  Maybe soba just isn't my thing since I kept comparing it to ramen, which is one of my obsessions. On a cold, dreary night, I still crave the warm, luscious broth of ramen over soba.	3star
Stumbled in here tonight without knowing it was spaghetti and meatballs night.... Now I know this sounds ridiculous, like who in their right mind would order spaghetti and meatballs at a fine dining establishment??? But if you come to Extra Virgin early enough (because apparently they sell out?!?!) on Sunday night, the spaghetti and meatballs are an absolute must. Make sure you come with a friend- because unless you've been starved in prison for two years, you won't be able to finish this dish on your own. The meatballs are HUGE. Two giant fistfuls of deliciously flavored meat sitting atop a luscious, kinda sweet, mouthwatering tomato sauce. The meatballs are served in a separate dish from the perfectly cooked spaghetti, which had a distinctively different tomato sauce than that of the meatballs. Best spaghetti and meatballs I've ever had- I'll come back again just to order this dish.  We did get a pistachio crusted goat cheese salad in the beginning- but skip it. Enjoy the complimentary bread instead and just move on to the entrees. (The appetizers are pretty skimpy for their price!)	4star
"So on my last visit to Brooklyn, my family was discussing lobster rolls, and my dad asked, ""what is that like sushi?"" My brother nearly spat his water out at my father in shock! Apparently, he either had never had one or had one so lackluster he couldn't remember it. It was then my brother declared we must all visit the Red Hook Lobster Pound for lobster rolls. I was quickly impressed by the small menu showing they know what they are doing & do it well. They have 3 types and we each tried a different one. They all looked pretty similar (see all the lovely yelp pictures) and they tasted better than imaginable. The prices seemed to go up based on yelp pictures of the old menu and were closer to $20 each, and they are small so I recommend getting a side or appetizer.  The mussels as an appetizer were awesome, perfectly baked and flavored. The desserts were also phenomenal and we fought over the last shared bits. I can't wait to go back here with friends or the hubby! If you want a lobster roll, this is where to get it!"	5star
The chicken biscuit is absurdly delicious. A huge chicken cutlet slathered with hot sauce and honey butter, forming a delicious pool for your biscuit to sit in. Really hit the spot late at night. The pie was good- the crust in particular had a chew and a density that, based on that description, I enjoyed much more than I would have thought. Not quite at the level of the chicken biscuit though. They also play really dope music. Erykah Badu makes everything taste better.	4star
The salads are awesome! The meat is good. We really wish they served pita bread.	3star
I want SSAM more! Good thing my friend made reservations here, we came on a rainy night and it was still busy. We were seated right away and our waitress gave us plenty of time to look over the menu and gave us her honest opinion about the items and answered all of our questions with perfect answers.  I ended up trying: Duck duck suze (cognac, duck fat, suze, and bitters) 5/5 -  because we all want to try duck fat and booze amiright? one drink and I was feeling pretty great for the whole dinner Braised pork bao 5/5 - it wasn't on the menu but we asked about it and she made it happen Fried curly corn-on-the-cob with squid ink aioli and ricotta 10/5 - it's corn cut to resemble octopus but eaten like ribs. I'd never thought in my life I would pay $15 for essentially half a corn, but this was the best corn i've ever had. paletero man, move over. Hokkaido uni over rice with trout roe, sesame furikake, and Japanese shiso leaves 4/5 - I mean it was still delicious as a dish, but compared to everything else, it wasn't anything that left me wanting more Whole grilled fish ssam with ginger scallion, bean sprouts, herbs, and tortillas 5/5 - deboned so i don't have to fear death and absolutely mouth watering. The perfect of sweet, salt, and sour in every bite with the tortilla.	5star
Dry and flavorless. I was looking forward to this new fast food restaurant opening, but was disappointed on my first and only meal. In my opinion, it's not really worth a 2nd try.	1star
Excellence comes in many forms . In a world full of corporate scripting of meals , P.L stays true. New York City / Brooklyn iconic restaurant. P.L has excellent food and original service.  Definitely worth a trip if you like authentic shtick and a very good steak . I love P.L for 30 years never had a bad meal . Cash is king here .....	5star
Absolutely obsessed with this place -- we came at around 6:45 PM on a Monday and didn't have to wait at all. The waiter was super friendly, let us pick where we wanted to sit, and promptly handed us the menu which was printed on the back of old storybook covers while explaining what they were known for (tapas and cocktails).  We ordered the infamous light up alcoholic capri-suns which were just fruity soju cocktails (and pretty dang strong cocktails at that). We ordered the Pure Jeremy and Lychee Rich and I personally preferred the Pure Jeremy because of the strawberry flavors. You could taste the soju in each but soju itself is pretty smooth going down, so that wasn't a problem at all. We also ordered four tapas to share and none of them disappointed. The kimchi paella (all star amazing), the tuna tataki (pretty good taste and stellar presentation), the chicharron (delicious and my boyfriend's favorite dish), and the spicy pulled pork taco (not the eel or pork belly which used to be on the menu but still pretty yummy).  Overall, I was extremely impressed by this place and will definitely be back for more after-work eats as well as brunch!	5star
"Where do I begin? With the wine list. A ""Vietnamese"" restaurant should not have a wine list that begins in the mid-$50s and averages somewhere in the $100s with many offerings in the $200s. That is pretentious and also, the wines aren't really worth it. They were out of the wine we ordered and couldn't see their way to offering a similar bottle at the same price. Second, my fish dish wasn't served with the rest of my company, who politely waited - a long time - for me to be served. My branzino arrived after I asked the server where it was. It came instantly with some lame explanation that they had been making it look pretty. It was cold. Meanwhile, two of my companions' shrimp had been overcooking in flavorless sauce in a hot pot. And then, since we were sitting in an area that was totally deprived of light, I couldn't see the bones in my limp and vaguely flavored fish. Vietnamese food is one of NYC's shortcomings, and this place does nothing to remedy that. If you've never had good Vietnamese food, maybe this tastes good to you, with its empty gestures toward the real thing, which is really and truly delicious."	1star
Super friendly people. Come with your friends are solo, the bartender will be super friendly. It's a very small cozy establishment so if you're bringing a large group of people call ahead.  Fries are amazing. Loved the steak skewers and wings. Some of the food is pricey (Average NYC prices) but you can get a reasonably priced burger and beer here.  Check it out.	5star
When I think Jamaican food, I think Ox-Tail. The Ox-Tail needs major work, not good at all.	1star
The people that eat here and rate this place highly are DEFINITELY not from the Caribbean. I was working on Water Street last week and was very happy to see a Caribbean food cart. The line was long so I figured it must be good.......WRONG! I ordered oxtail and peas and rice. The peas and rice was decent however the oxtail was terrible! How do you mess up oxtail? I was so disappointed; I will definitely not be going back. Work on your flavor and seasoning; oxtail is a pretty easy meat to cook!	2star
The rating is just based of on the strawberry cheesecake I had here. I found the cheesecake to be just okay and the strawberry pieces on the top were too big..I would have liked it if they had sliced the strawberry pieces so its easier to enjoy it with each bite of cheesecake. Overall its good but not extraordinary. Though I enjoyed eating it and helped me get over my sweet craving!!	3star
This was quite possibly the most boring meal that I've had in New York City in the last 35 years. One star for the delicious bread and butter and another for the lobster and chili spaghetti. Everything else was a complete miss - from the disinterested service (he didn't smile once and sighed before he spoke to us?!) to the uninspired contemporary American cooking. Skipped dessert as we couldn't wait to get out of there. $240 for two people with one drink each?! I had better meals at both Red Rooster and Del Posto  this week for less money	2star
We live for bars like this one. Tanner Smith's is a hidden gem, tucked away amongst the chaos of Times Square. The vibe is incredibly cool---charleston-style, with a pre-prohibition feel. The decor is fantastic. Very old timey/modern feel-there is something about Charlie Chaplin movies playing while listening to Kanye.... Their cocktail menu (which is a book, really) is impressive. We ordered the pretzels and duck confit spring rolls first. The pretzels were great, but the duck spring rolls were incredibly greasy, greasier than normal confit. The pork bun sliders were great, but the portion was small for the price. Mole chicken tacos were flavorful, but dry.  We will definitely return for cocktails and the bar vibe and to give their brunch a try. Unfortunately the food didn't hold up.	4star
We went during happy hour/early evening.  Initial impression was a very lively place with a great crowd and the vibe draws you in.  And the place filled up quickly.  Once settled the excitement dimmed a bit for several reasons.  First, limited table real estates required careful maneuvering of drinks and plates.  Second, we were sitting so close to the next table I could hear their conversations and vice versa I'm sure.  The tables are very close to each other, great if you don't mind the noise.  Third, the wine flights and menu items didn't quite live up to expectation from all the great reviews, assumption bias? High mark for the staff for friendly and quick service.  I'd go back again but with a larger group.	3star
Don't even bother coming to this place . We came here because it was one of the best rated restaurants in the area but we were all disappointed. I came here with my family and none of us enjoyed the food, my mom couldn't even finish hers because of how greasy the food was. Our waitress didn't seem to care that half the food was left on the plate and did not ask if there was anything wrong with it. Food is overpriced for the quality (really, $11 for a tiny bowl of guac?) I still don't understand how this place has this high of a rating with such a high amount of reviews...	2star
Hosted a dinner for people at my firm last night.  The space is nice, and the restaurant wasn't too crowded and noise level was reasonable.  I had the steamed sea bass as my entrée, which was excellent--it was light and was very flavorful without being overpowering.  Others had the beercan chicken, the steak, the ribs, and all seemed to be happy.  I also had the wedge salad as an appetizer, which was good as well.  The only reason for 4 stars was the agonizingly slow service.  It took around 25 minutes to get our appetizers, and over an hour from the time we ordered to get our entrees.  I complained numerous times--they apologized, but aside from offering a few free second round drinks, didn't really compensate.  Overall, a decent new restaurant that could be great if it got its service issues in order.	4star
Havana outpost has taken over the entire block and we loved it! 2 locations across the street from each other one was habana to go and looked like the one in NOHO and across the street there is the outdoor seating one.  Went to the outdoor one on a Friday night and boy was it packed! Every seat outside was full and there was even a bouncer at the door. Every person had a margarita in hand and looked like they were having a really fun time.  We just ate the food and as always the cheese corn did not disappoint! Wait time was quick for the food, and found a seat inside behind the registers.  Good prices good food and good vibes.  One star removed that there was no space outside, maybe take reservations for some tables outside so that new people can come, it seems as though people were there for hours in one seat, so new people just had to stand around.  Cash only fyi !	4star
"Come here for ridiculous brunch cocktails, stay because you ordered way too much heavy southern inspired food and can't get up. If you can bear the hour-plus wait, then Jacob's Pickles is definitely worth going for the experience. On weekends, it seems like everyone and their mother comes here. It's not a small restaurant by any means, but boy does it fill up. We were originally quoted 2 hours, but they called us back after one. We were a group of five, and they stuck us in a tight four person table. Luckily, the folks next to us were understanding (and not fat), so we made it work. Onto the food. You can't go to a place with the word ""pickles"" in the named and not order some pickles (unless you're a terrible person). We went with the thyme japaneos, sweet/spicy carrots, special sour cukes, and the candy red beets. I'm a very harsh critic of pickles since I pickle my own (probably the most Brooklyn thing I've ever written), but the ones at Jacob's pickles get my seal of approval. For drinks, definitely get the Bloody BLT. It has bacon and a pickled egg in it. Come on. You know you want to. For my main, I went with the Southern BLT (unintentional BLT theme, I swear). IT was buttermilk fried chicken, with fried green tomatoes, and bacon, with a side of grits. Let me tell you, it was H-E-A-V-Y. Not for the faint of heart or faint of stomach. It was a fine sandwich, but nothing out of the ordinary. We also ordered the mac and cheese with chicken as an app, but that didn't come until we had our mains, so we felt like gluttons (both for food and punishment). Other than that, service was great. Our server Christa (or Krista) was funny and didn't get annoyed with our annoying drunk antics. The manager Zack also came over to joke around with us (and gently nudge us out the door so more customers could come in). Good times all around. But come hungry. Very hungry."	4star
Absolutely amazing food, server brought around free shots, warm and friendly atmosphere. Just an all around great place!!!	5star
Burnt ends, pork belly, and wet ribs please! With side of mac n cheese please! Another reason for me to venture more in Astoria.	4star
The food tastes great I love the boil special sauce but the price:( two crab legs for $38 I spent $162 for two people are we didn't even walk out full. The size of the food is deceiving because most of it is shell, organs etc and not meat. I don't recommend the crawfish. I got the combo crawfish and lobster. The lobster was good but the crawfish is way too small and you take 5 min to open it up and take the meat out but you end up only getting little crumbs of meat. The corn that comes with the combo was really good, sweet salty and perfect. I also got the soft crab appetizer that was ok but definitely not worth $12. The oysters were ok, there were some sand and small shell pieces in them. The lobster roll was also great I love the bread and the lobster but again for $18 for a small hot dog size...Customer service was great though! My server was super nice!  All in all if you were coming here and not worried about the price, you should definitely try the king crab legs, lobster roll, and lobster with the boil special sauce!	3star
If you're looking for BBQ in the area look no further !  My gf and I used a Groupon here but be warned if you want the burnt ends it's additional. But oh so worth it! My only complaint is that the portion was kind of small for the price (w/or w/o) the groupon.  My friend had the 50/50 but she said her pork was a bit on the dry side :( But did I mention how juicy and tender the burnt ends were ahhhhhmazing !	4star
We came here on a Saturday night. We were seated near the bar area. I liked the wooden inferior walls, as it felt more like a place for fried chicken and ribs than your typical Korean joint. We ordered the wings, kimchi fried rice and bulgogi tacos. The wings were good, about the same quality as bonchon. The kimchi fried rice was disappointing -- it was lukewarm and too salty. The tacos had soggy tortilla and sauce was too sweet.  Tl;Dr food was disappointing, but drink selection was good. I would come back for wings and drinks, but not for full-on dinner	2star
Now I can cross this place off my food list. After numerous attempts of trying to come here, I finally made it.  My friend and I were here last Friday for dinner and I was surprised the wait only took 10 minutes. The ambience looked amazing especially the ceiling lights. It's like something you'll find in the Guggenheim museum. Keep in mind that this place is small so if you have a party of five and up, well good luck. Now off with the food!  For appetizers we ordered the U & I (uni) and the  tebasaki gyoza- deep fried chicken wings stuff with foie gras. I never had uni before so it was an interesting texture. The dish itself had a whole a lot going. To the point I didn't noticed there was wasabi hiding next to the rice. The gyoza tasted well too but it's not a dish I would want to order again.  For my entree I got the Mu ramen with extra seasoned bamboo. Honestly, I like the ramen but it's not something I would go crazy for.	4star
"Udon is an item that is lacking in NYC.  I finally found a place I thought would be great, but it was lacking.  The udon noodles themselves are subpar.  They're premade and not cooked well.  You could get better udon noodles by purchasing the frozen ""bricks"" of udon noodles from the market.  The dashi broth was also lacking in flavor and complexity.  It's also a somewhat expensive lunch. There was once an udon place in the theater district that was excellent and they made their noodles from scratch all day long.  I never knew what the place was called, but I tried going back and they had closed."	2star
We came here 3 nights in a row because it was the only thing in this neighborhood we could find open after midnight. The food and drinks were good. However, the cookie from their cookie skillet burned my mouth so bad, it required medical attention.	4star
Love this place, we ordered a few plates to share and couldn't decide which was best. We had the chicken nachos, Mediterranean plate, chicken parm sandwich and grilled cheese sandwich. Would definitely go back.	5star
It's one of those night we craved for meat, alot of meats! after sipping couple of cocktails near the area, we decided to go for BBQ, it was a beautiful Thursday evening dinner time, the place was not too crowded, on the counter we ordered half rack ribs, quarter pound of pork belly and brisket, baked beans and broccoli salad sides, the order and food process were relatively quick, then we ring up at the counter, if you want to order your liquor, move slightly to the left where the bar is, there's quite a few selection of beers, whiskey and cocktails. Out of all the items, I like brisket and broccoli only, although brisket was abit too dry to my taste, very disappointed w pork belly, totally bland, dry rub ribs on the other side were abit too salty but without much flavor to it, it was neither juicy nor tender, I am the girl who knows and loves ribs and i have to sadly admit i do not like the ribs! the BBQ sauce is abit on the sweeter end as well; but i like the vinegar pepper sauce, it's got a great kick to it! the ambiance of the restaurant is kind of retro and casual, w wooden communal tables and seats w some outdoor spaces if you wish to get some sun on a sunny day! $60 for my entire order without drinks, Fette Sau, i think you can do better!! Kudos for not using plastic utensils!	3star
You think it's great to have a no tipping policy until you experience the second rate service.  The food is excellent however they are obviously short staffed which is very disappointing. No one approached our table to take a drink order for 15 minutes.  We had no idea that there were any specials until we heard the next table being told what they were..........after we ordered!  The dirty plates and glasses were not removed from the table from the first course even while the second course was served.  The food is excellent however the lousy service makes this a place I would never return to or recommend.	2star
Gave this place another try because of all the favorable reviews. I don't know what other yelpers are talking about,  raving about this spot. Ordered the beef stomach flat noodles. The beef was tough as it gets, like it was still alive and kicking. Wasnt tender at all. Also was given huge chunks of cartilage and fat which was totally inedible. My jaw hurts from eating here. I have eaten here before and it was mediocre, but after today's outing, never again.	1star
Been there a few times.     First with the wife before a show and it was great.   Went back with the family the next time and again great. But, the last time was a disappointment.  The food was luke warm at best.   The chicken parm was one small cold piece of chicken on a plate.   Sent it back.  Came out again 20 minutes later dried out and chewey	3star
The food here is great, especially the lasagna. My only and biggest complaint is that I made a reservation specifically so that I wouldn't be late to my next event and that I wouldn't have to wait to get seated. However, I ended up having to wait over half an hour just to get seated and the service wasn't even that attentive. An apology is expected, but so is an extra bit of attention when you make a guest with a reservation wait 30+ minutes.	3star
This place is the easiest 5 stars I've ever given. Came here last night for dinner with my mom(who is the harshest food critic) and we were both blown away.  The ambiance is really nice. Dim lighting, cozy, but not too crammed. Interesting music selection(90's hip hop). We came pretty early so it wasn't packed yet, but it started to get pretty loud by the time we were leaving. It's a very lively place with a young crowd.  So this was one of the best dinners I've had in my entire life. My mom and I ordered the goat cheese salad and short rib sliders to start, then she got the tuna app for her entree and I got the salmon. It's hard for me to choose which was my favorite, but every dish was made to perfection. The presentations were also gorgeous. I think the dish that stood out to me the most were the short rib sliders. There are only 3 on a plate, so I wish I just ordered 5 of those. I highly recommend these and the salmon dish. But, again, I can't say anything we ordered was lacking. This place is top notch. Also, I have to give a shout out to our waitress who was incredibly helpful and really nice. Great service. I forget her name but she had short blonde hair. Thank god this restaurant is down the street from me because I will be coming here all the time.	5star
It's been awhile but I came back for the delicious khao soi.  It was just as good as I remembered!   Don't be fooled by the term small plate.  All the dishes were big enough for two.  If sharing start with a few small plates and order more if needed.  We were a table of 4 and we didn't order any large plates.  We had more than enough food.    Khao soi - excellent!  Just as good as they make in Thailand.  Love!  ( this is not a small plate - 2 people can share)  Pork belly adobo - excellent with a touch of spice. Clay pot special - pork and beef with noodles - very good and flavorful. (Big enough for 2 people) Papaya salad - very good (2 people can easily share this) Monkfish - very good Dessert Halo halo- very unique and amazing!  Try it.  Again sharing is caring and this is a big dessert!	4star
Probably the best italian food in the city. Loved the bread basket, ravioli is a must have!  The place is perfect for a dinner date!	5star
I am writing this for Moms and Dads who might not know the potential fire hazard your stroller has at Quality Meats.  Unfortunately, we never made it past the front door.  I was so excited about this reservation and even called ahead of time to remind them that my son wouldn't be eating (since he is 8 mos), but I included him in our reservation count.  When we arrived, I was told that we weren't allowed to bring our baby stroller because it's a fire hazard.  Now, I am a realist and can understand why a crowded restaurant wouldn't want a stroller in the main dining room.... but, they should have told me this prior.  In my reservation on Open Table and my phone conversation with the restaurant I mentioned my infant son and at no-time did any restaurant staff mention they didn't accommodate strollers. I left feeling embarrassed, but ultimately just be warned that Quality Meats doesn't allow babies in strollers.	1star
the beef is borderline disgusting and the place is highly overpriced.  if you feel a street hot dog with a few toppings is worth 6$ then your INSANE	1star
I have no clue why everyone likes this place. The food is inedible. Maybe you have to be completely drunk out of your mind to appreciate this food?!  We went yesterday and ordered the Takana Meshi which is sauteed pork and takana pickles over rice. We also ordered the Omusoba which is stir fried yakisoba noodle and pork wrapped in an omlette and topped with Okonomiyaki sauce and mayonnaise. It was unbearable super duper salty. How can people eat this. I do not like wasting food so I just went along with it when I really wanted to tell the waiter but I didn't want to make a fuss and we had to leave soon because of show tickets. Not that the waiter was really there to ask us how the food was. We were kind of ignored during the entire meal. Not that I care much.  I do not plan on coming back to Sake Bar Hagi. The food was disgusting!	1star
Cash only! When walking past, don't be deterred by the small interiors -- there's more seating downstairs! Don't let the photo of Guy Fieri scare you either -- the noodles here are delicious. We got the regular hand pulled noodles pan fried with duck and it was amazing. The duck was the standout for me, over the noodles, because it was so moist and tender. And because I firmly believe no dumpling should be left behind, make sure you get an order of the pan fried pork dumplings to go with. There's nothing standout about this place per se, but just a really solid plate of food.	4star
"Alcove is unique in this part of Queens for its customer service. The food and drinks are good as well. However, as a restaurant person for many years, their service really stands out. I only go every few months, but every single time, the server, bartender, or owners remember my face. They are prompt, attention to detail and check on you regularly. They have even sent us a little after dinner drink to sip on (or shoot). The whole place really captures ""neighborhood feel"" more than the rest on the Skillman Ave.  stretch and for that we will continuously stop in for dinner and drinks. It's our go-to in the hood when people visit as well."	5star
"You can't go wrong with Breakroom if you order their tacos. I always stick to a taco platter for lunch (which is best if you're ordering more than 2 tacos) and is affordable and really tasty. The ambiance is lacking (really good music playing in the background though) and pretty basic so I wouldn't bring a ""date"" here. But it's a place where you can bring a friend or two (if you're able to find seating). It's small so it gets pretty tight. I still would've given this place 5 stars but I must be honest, their cashier is lacking some basic customer service which would go a long way. Don't get me wrong, she's nice but is not warm. It turned me off but not enough for me to stop eating from here (given the fact that the food is so good)."	4star
All 3 of the soup dumplings are amazing! The dipping sauces go perfectly with them and you can add a dash of Sriracha for some spice. My favorite is the Spicy Pork Soup Dumplings, they are medium spicy and taste sooo good!	5star
Today was my first time eating at this spectacular place, is small and cozy, the food was really good and the Colombian coffee was to die for... The owner was a nice guy ,and treat me and my boyfriend like Kings, I was very pleased with his service and also his brother who is also working there, very polite and always attentive.  I recommended 100%  i will definitely go back. Congratulations to the owner, we needed a place like this in Skillman. Good luck. Cecilia and Saul	5star
This place is a Sunnyside gem. The skirt steak lollipops were delicious as were the truffle fries. The decor and atmosphere is very quaint-kind of hipstery, but very cozy. The service was incredibly friendly and attentive. I will definitely be back.	4star
Servers were very friendly and prompt, and the food tasted alright. I didn't feel like it was anything spectacular though. The display of the food was well done. The place is very casual, and the TV display kind of took up most of the view for those seated facing the  door, which if you are going on a date or for some quality time with some friends will be a bit of a distraction.	3star
Went there with Hershey earlier today. the Connecticut roll was delicious! well worth the $25!! it was so succulent!! we were there during happy hour and the drinks were on point as well... service was good and the music was on point... highly recommended..	4star
Honestly, we had a good night if it wasn't for the following: One of the glass cups we were given had dried crust inside.  We asked the nice waitress to bring us a new one in which she said it was just a scratched cup but she brought us a new one anyways. Poured myself a glass of water and low and behold, the same dried crust (unless its another cup) is now floating at the top.   Ordered the wings as an appetizer and they were delicious.  However, the carrot that came with the wings tasted spoiled and mushy.  I had to spit it out on my napkin.   Also, the bus boy asked us 3x if we were finished even though we all had food on our plates. I can understand if they were busy but there were open tables and no customers waiting to be seated.  The one thing I would definitely recommend to try is their apple pie cocktail.  It tasted like spiced apple pie and I really enjoyed it.	3star
Best thing ever!!! Lobster grilled cheese and lobster roll was amazing! The best I've ever had!!! Everything tasted so fresh and the bread went well with it. It's a pretty small portion so everyone should order their own sandwiches. We also got clam chowder. It just tasted normal so nothing special about it.  This place is a must-go!! I'll be back to them lobster roll (:	5star
On a friend's recommendation I tried this place for brunch. The place gets pretty crowded at 11 in the morning on a sunday. They don't take reservations and one could easily wait 40 minutes for a spot. We tried the salmon egg benedict, shakshuka, mediterranean breakfast and waffles (it was a group and I didn't eat all of it!!). While shakshuka and Mediterranean were good, it was only the salmon egg Benedict and waffles that were exceptional and stood out. Combination of hollandaise sauce with the benedict was to die for.  The fresh cantaloupe juice was refreshing, and spicy cheesecake was an orthodox but nice choice for our dessert. It wasn't really spicy only had a little hint of it. I would love to visit this place again!	4star
"I went to the new location at the Excelsior Hotel, for the 1st time the other night with friends, and was just as happy with the decor & food as I was at the old location.  We made reservations and our table was ready a 1/2hr earlier than our scheduled dinner time.   A major ""plus"" was i was the 1st of 7 to arrive and the hostess gave me the choice to be seated at the table or at the bar.  Most restaurants won't let u sit at the table until your entire party arrives .  FYI, I chose to sit at our table and while I waited I checked in on YELP and got my free sangria as promised  it was ginormous and delicious   Unfortunately our waiter had a little bit of an attitude with us not sure why because we're always polite but he made us feel a little bit rushed and there was no need for that since the restaurant was not packed that night ... other than that everyone else at the restaurant was great with us.  I will be going back"	5star
"The tart taste of the Tom Yam soup stimulated our appetite nicely to start the dinner. I ordered special menu, crispy pad thai. I was surprised that pad thai came with no noodle! The ""crispy"" meant the round rice chips on the side. It was an interesting twist to a pad thai, but it would have been much better if it had some actual noodle in it. It felt like it was too much raw bean sprouts and ingredients not blended in well. Basil eggplant good overall, but the eggplant was not perfectly soft, and a little salty. Overall good, but could be better!"	4star
Solid offering by Felice and a surprise being in a hotel lobby. We mostly had breakfasts here and we enjoyed what we ate. There are various options with a bit of a latino twist. Coffee and Tea is decent and the service good. Portions are good without being overbearing. There are a couple of interesting off beat options on the menu and I encourage you to try them.	4star
Oh Yelp. You've let me down. I came here with high expectations. But this is a very ordinary Thai place.  Now don't get me wrong, in the suburbs, these places are a useful and common. Solid Thai.  But this is the Manhattan. There are tons of restaurants. And tons of better places than this.  The Tom Yum soup had a decent enough broth. But it was sprinkled with mushrooms and three pieces of chicken. Where are the vegetables? $5 for essentially broth? Good markup.  Then the drunk woman noodle with a red pepper next to it. But where is the spice? It was sweet, almost overly so.  So.... if you're looking for Thai, locally this may fit the bill. By those expecting something extraordinary should look elsewhere.	2star
I have my list of top 3 favorite restaurants around the world and this old establishment is on it. You cannot talk about New York style steakhouse without mentioning Peter Luger. I usually go in with a group of 3 and order the steak for two, german hash, tomatoes and onions, and two strips of bacon. The portion is huge and you definitely will be satisfied. You can definitely tell that the steak had been dry aged very well even with the very first bite. Steak comes out nicely seared and tender and juicy inside. Personally, I order my steak medium and it came out perfect every time. Gotta go in with a lot of cash! Credit cards not accepted.	5star
Loved the food and atmosphere of the restaurant! The wait wasn't too long, and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu! If you're looking to grab a drink, a quick bite to eat, or a nice place to have dinner in Hell's Kitchen, this is the place! I originally had planned to order the Pho Bo, but the picture and description of the Grilled Pork and Shrimp Bu'n changed my mind. The entree had just the right amount of seasoning, vermicelli noodles, and fresh veggies! I would definitely recommend it if you're a fan of pork!	4star
A++++ food and service  Awesome specials and gray prices  Definitely give this place a visit and the owner Jeff is the man (he gave us free shota, he has to be a good guy) Great place, give it a visit	5star
I cry a little bit on the inside every single time I bite into their lobster rolls, because I know each of those bites are $5. But my mouth is also filled with joy after each bites. If I don't think about the $16 price tag, I would say I thoroughly enjoy Luke's. My favorite is actually the bread! It's very well toasted, with the right amount of butter. Their lobsters weren't smothered in mayo. The lobsters were fresh. The portion is small though, I told you, $5 per bite, and after 3-4 bites, you're done. Don't expect to be full from this. I think you'd need maybe 3 or 4. Of course, spending $50 just sounds silly. New York has so much food, just pre-game with lobster rolls and go somewhere else. That's what I did.	4star
I seen lines heading out the door down the block sometimes. Decided to give this COAL FIRED PIZZA a try. This place uses: great quality ingredients, cooks perfectly, taste awesome, and it's fresh out the brick coal oven to your table. The pizza is a thin crust but made awesome. I gave this place four stars just short of 5 stars because the plastic forks and knives don't cut through the pizza and the tables and chairs are wobbling. You literally have to eat while doing a balancing act. Smh ...	4star
Came here for my friend's birthday dinner on a Monday night 6:30pm. There was a little wait until they opened the second floor up and we got seated upstairs.    Con: happy hour ends at six :( Soju cocktails didn't taste strong so we got a bottle of chum churum and that did the trick ;P Pros: the food was so good and unique! I eat often at ktown and was so happy to try barn joo's take on korean dishes. I lived the pork belly tacos, ceviche with buckwheat noodles, and a dish with super flavorful beef cubes and potatoes. The japchae, korean pancakes, wings, and seafood stew were also well done. Decor was cute, restrooms clean, waiters friendly and quick. Would return again!	4star
"I was ready to give this place 5 stars until something very unexpected happened at the tail end of our visit but I'll get to that shortly... Sunday morning and NO wait at this place for brunch- an automatic score. Typically I'd be weary of a place with no wait but my insecurities floated away as we walked in and saw a packed restaurant and a live band! The restaurant itself has a cools vibe with great decor and a whiskey/bourbon selection to satisfy. The menu had great choices and a ""tipsy tea"" option for those inclined to have more than one mid-morning drink! Two of the people in my party chose that, while I settled in with a Bloody Mary. And now for the food. I got the ""Sammy"" with a fried egg, bacon, and jack cheese on ciabatta that was outrageous!!! Much better than I anticipated for whatever reason. Others got the baked eggs, avocado smash, shrimp and grits, and the eggs Benedict- all with raving reviews. In truth, this place was fantastic from start to....almost finish. Remember that tipsy tea thing i mentioned earlier? Well, included in that was the promise of ""tea cakes"" at the end of your meal- essentially French macaroons. Great, fantastic. However, each plate came with three choices of macaroon, one with what seemed like a strawberry filling, one with a caramel, and one with again, what seemed like chocolate filling. Being the chocolate lover that I am, of course I chose that cookie. I took a bite and bam. Hit like a ton of bricks with a powerful, flavor blast of lavender. Lavender? I don't even know. All I do know is that it tasted like I bit into a bath bomb from Bath and Body Works. Unfortunate because the meal was so great but wow, unexpected and unwanted.  All in all, it was a great experience and I will definitely be back! Just be sure to skip those lavender soap bombs disguised as chocolate sunshine."	4star
Okay food,terrible service, waited 2 hrs for at home delivery. Done - never doing this spot again	1star
You won't go wrong ordering any dish here. It's very authentic Hong Kong style noodles. Hot tea or ice water is offered when you sit down. They come around and refill your tea cup. No extra charge. But you can also order beer, Bruce Cost ginger beer, HK style tea, soy milk, Mango punch, etc.  Steamed rice rolls with hoisin and peanut sauce: the mixture of the 2 sauces is like a match made in heaven. The rice rolls are not soggy and are steamed perfectly. White clams with garlic: steamed clams with fried garlic and dabs of soy sauce. Every clam was open (no bad clams on the dish) Braised beef brisket and wonton noodles: mom is a very picky eater and she said this is just like the ones she had in Hong Kong. They skim the fat, so the soup is not oily at all. The wontons have fresh shrimp and pork to create that scrunch when you bit into it. Without the shrimp, the wonton is just mush from the pork. Best wontons too! It's very authentic Hong Kong style noodles. The noodles are al dente, not soggy like other restaurants. Steam Shanghai soup dumplings: Although soup dumplings is a Shanghai dish, they do it justice at this Cantonese noodle venue. Each morsel is an explosion of flavor. Dip the dumpling in the vinegar dumpling sauce and put the whole dumpling in your mouth. Let the juices explode in your mouth! Make sure it's not too hot. Don't confuse soup dumplings with dumpling soup. Soup dumplings have the soup INSIDE the dumpling. Dumpling soup are dumplings in a bowl of broth. Congee: it's a rice porridge that can be mixed with different toppings. sampan, fish, or minced beef are are classics. They have a vegetarian Congee with mustard greens and pumpkin that's not available elsewhere. Sampan has squid, tripe, beef, pork, and  peanuts. Chinese parents and grandparents would make Congee when you're under the weather or you've lost your appetite. It's comfort food. Rice casseroles: we like the fish casserole. Mom likes the Chinese sausage with preserved meats. They have a special sweetened soy sauce that goes with the rice casserole. Scrape the crispy rice from the edge and bottom of the pot. It adds an extra crunch. That's actually my favorite part.	5star
"To be honest, a total disappointment... I came here because of a Yelp Elite event with the hope that the ""acclaimed"" Michelin guide restaurant was going to be a unique experience. In fact it was, the only place I've eaten a totally average and not worth remembering food. The place is small with only two persons serving the meals for everyone so I barely could try any of the dishes they were offering. It's a tapas place from what I saw and got to try. Some flatbreads or cocas in Spanish, patatas bravas that were actually Yucca fries, chorizo with garlic, watermelon with crudo and bacon wrapped dates. Nothing worth the trip to uptown Morningside Heights and surely not to waste your appetite in such simple tasted dishes. It's OK, but sincerely OK for a Michelin guide is not good at all! The wine was bitter and their sangria which I didn't have but my girlfriend did was no good. The place looks dark and not cozy at all. When we got there we thought it was closed! If it wasn't for the TV's (already a sign of a bad place) we wouldn't have enter the restaurant. I do not know the prices and it will keep being that way. Not interested in this kind of dining... at all."	2star
"Came here for brunch today. I would recommend it, if you're looking for a good bargain, but the food was underwhelming. The guacamole was very average and the Cubano torta had more mayo than meet on it. Very sloppy. Was basically a tomato, avocado and sauce sandwich.  Pluses are the $7 brunch drinks and $13 entrees (still shows $11 on their website). I started with their spin on a mimosa, the ""Mirosa"" which was too sweet for my liking, so I switched to standard mimosas, which were good. My friends got a bloody Maria and margueritas and they seem pleased but not overly impressed either.  The tight space was well done and cozy. I would be willing to go back to give their dinner menu a shot."	2star
I wanted to try this place since it opened I've had their breakfast burritos which was cash only and about $4 each. They were delicious! I tried to go back for lunch but the line around 12pm was MASSIVE needless to say I couldn't try out the other items on the menu that day. So finally yesterday I went here after work around 9:30pm tried 3 carne asade tacos...BEST DAMN TACOS I've had in a looong time! Delicious well seasoned and quick service ( it was nearing closing time) definitely would recommend this place if you have time to wait on line. But believe me it's worth it!	5star
"Very tasty but small portions when you order to go. The portions look bigger there.  Also, an annoying first impression: Long story short, I ordered something to go, and they forgot about my order. I stood by the cashier the whole time and never heard my name, so I think they accidentally lumped my receipt with another finished receipt? Or forgot to print it out? Who knows. When I pointed out that I didn't get my food yet, they immediately accused me of not ""listening"" and said someone else took my food. Um, okay.... no. You still have to make my food, thanks? I've been standing next to you the whole time, so unless you've been whispering, nope. I'm pretty sure you're wrong. Also, it took you literally 30 seconds to whip up my order and I've been waiting next to you fro 20 minutes...."	3star
$15 card minimum. Very very tiny space - maybe room for 10-15 people to sit very closely together (like you have to get out of your chair, push it in, and then stand out of the way for people to pass you). With that being said, it was pretty cheap and pretty good. Order at the counter and they bring it to you. I had the pork belly sandwich (if you like pork belly, you'll love this sandwich - the pork belly tasted really good and was cooked well and the flavors all complemented each other). My friend got the taco platter and she said it was good. We also shared fries, which was just really fattening (egg, tots, cheese, bacon bits, who else knows what was in there). So definitely come here if you're trying to break your 2017 diet resolutions.	4star
Was excited about bringing my sister here for her birthday dinner cause she loves seafood but the food did not meet our expectation/ the hype. Fish tacos were bland in taste that we had to add lots of hot sauce in to bring some taste to it. The lobster mac and cheese was nice but nothing too special. The fried calamaris were totally bland in taste including the dipping sauce. Oysters were kind of small but the clams were sooo delicious and that was the best out of everything we ate. Our waiter was amazing and friendly but sadly foods weren't that good.	3star
Decided to give this spot a go for a Sunday evening dinner with a couple of buddies of mine. There's an outdoor seating section in the back of the restaurant and an indoor section where most people are. If you're not ordering to go then you have to approach the counter to get a number and they will call you based on that number- it can get a little messy initially if the staff isn't on top of their game since we saw a few other people hanging around before I was there with my buddies but none of them got their numbers yet my team and I were seated before anyone else was.  BUT with that being said- the food here was great! Since it was just the four of us we decided to go family style and have a little bit of everything. The spicy duck sauce here was excellent, it had a nice kick to it without being too spicy but had enough flavor to pack a punch. Pad Thai noodles were delicious and the shrimp fried rice was a nice addition to have. Overall, a nice local Thai spot to go out to for dinner or catching up with some friends.  Minus one star...only because it's cash only here!	4star
Wont return.  A bit slow on service for small place.  Very expensive for ok food. Food wasn't anything special. The calamari was great. The selection was limited. My kids who normally eat everything,  left a lot on their plates.	2star
My first thoughts about Gastroteca was that they have a decent menu with extremely cheap cocktails and the ambience is out of this world. On second thought (after tasting their menu items) I am apt to still believe this, but I feel their food is lacking in flavor. My partner ordered a WINter75 cocktail and a fried eggplant and burrata sandwich and I ordered a bloody mary and had the crispy gnocchi.   Their WINter 75 cocktail was a winner.   Well balanced with the gin, prosecco, earl grey syrup (so delicate) and light on the lemon it was a definite hit.  I felt I was missing out on it once I tried it and wished I had ordered it instead. Their eggplant and burrata sandwich was okay.  The melty burrata seemed to give the sandwich some flavor but otherwise it was rather bland and felt like packing carbs.  It came with a side salad that was some lettuce leaves tossed in a very oiled down yet excellent balsamic.  It tasted good, but you could barely taste it.  Okay, the salad was pretty wimpy if we're being honest.  My bloody mary was pretty horrid as far as the standard goes. It came without rimmer and the garnish was two clunkily sliced pieces of lemon and lime.  It looked like garbage, and it tasted merely alright.  The bloody mary mix they used was okay but they seemingly added nothing to it. My gnocchi was scantly plated.  They used a larger plate but there was barely any gnocchi on it.  The gnocchi itself was very fresh but with every bite I was searching for the flavor with it nowhere to be found.  I waited for the basil, pistachio and spinach to hit alas it never came.  Would I come here again?  In a pinch, yes.  Will I be going out of my way? No, absolutely not.	3star
For as long as I've been coming to Dumbo and The Brooklyn Bridge Park, I've never joined the long line in front of the Famous Pizza Shop.... until now! My Wife & I really wanted some Pizza after enjoying PhotoVille. The line was no at long as usual so we decided to finally see what the hype was about. We stood on line for no longer than a few minutes before the next party of 2 (us!) was called in. We sat on the lower level at a Table on the other side of a wall where the Oven was. My Wife had the view of the Kitchen where the Pizzas were being made and she was in awe. I liked the fact that there was so much history in the Grimaldi's as well as a sense that everyone who worked there must've worked there for years. There's also no delivery & no Alcohol! Way to stick to old school rules! The look on everyone's face waiting for their Pizza was one of the most amusing parts of my time here. Oh! & The Pizza? AH-MAZING! The crust! The cheese! Everything about was amazing! So worth the hype!	5star
A lot of beer on tap and a lot of food choices. Got the delicious deviled eggs and mussels for appetizers. Both were good. The chicken and waffles were a bit disappointing. Our waffle was so soft and not crispy. Flavor was good. Chicken had a lot of flavor but it comes with one little piece. At least ours was. The lobster sandwich was okay. The lobster part was good but the bacon was too overpowering. I had to separate the sandwich and just eat the lobster.	4star
"I've been living in NY for the past 8 months and this was one my first spots my husband took me. Had the best experience on that occasion. Great food, service and overall experience.  Today we attended another brunch event, it was ticketed and poorly arranged so we got no food. Coming to five leaves, we were told the wait would be an hour which I was fine with. After 40 minutes of waiting, I asked the host where we are in the line to which I got "" you just have to keep waiting, I can't keep checking""   Here's my note to the hostess  : 1) That response was beyond poor because Its the first time i'm asking.  2) we have a 105 pound Rottweiler waiting in the hot sun , my mother visiting from another country and we all haven't eaten for the day. The reality is we're just as frustrated and annoyed as you were but my tone didn't reflect that when I spoke to you. Don't think I'll be back again because if you're not taking reservations and not giving folks that courtesy of being polite, it's really not worth it."	1star
"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in the city (so far!) and I will continue coming here (even though it's a trip for me!).  Their menu is very convenient as they include ""V"" for vegetarian options and ""GF"" for gluten-free options. Coming from someone that is Celiac and can get sick easily after dining out, this makes me feel good and enjoy my meal without being anxious about cross-contamination and without the hassle of explaining to the waiter about it! They have a very diverse menu so plenty of options to choose from. I had the shrimp pad thai and it was very fresh. Service was incredible!  I'd recommend making a reservation, but they accept walk-ins. We didn't make one and had to wait 30min on a Saturday night (not too bad for how good the food was!). The interior decor is pretty, with nice lamps and (artificial?) plants in the ceiling.  The quality of the food & service, along with the prices, makes this place a 10/10! Would definitely recommend it for dinner!"	5star
Almost perfect!  The food took forever but was worth the wait.  The Veggie curry was really good and the potato app!  Yum!  First Sake ordered was fantastic, then we lowered the budget and it was hard to drink.   Note to other patrons of this lovely small restaurant.  If you are going with a big group of 8- please refrain from invading personal space while people eat.  Also why are you going with 8 people to a tiny restaurant on a friday night?  Sheesh.	4star
Disappointed - dry for the sandwich and salty for the salad bowl I love Vietnamese food - I almost tried every places in Brooklyn - but this place is just so so.  The only unique part is that they have vegetarian ham #7 - which I ordered.  It tastes like a regular bun mi - toasted bread, vegetarian tofu ham, pickled carrot and daikon, jalapeno, mayo and cilantro.   Salad bowl #1 - all I have to say is salty period Okay to try if you are in the neighborhood - but I will not go out of my way for this.	3star
"Although the decor and set up in this place is cute I didn't think the food or the wait for the food was all it was cracked up to be, sadly. When we arrived we stood in line for about 40 minutes; we grabbed a beer at the bar for the wait. Things were coming off the menu as we waited but luckily what I wanted to try remained.  Together we ordered the pulled pork sandwich, Korean ribs, cornbread and Mac and cheese. The Korean BBQ ribs were delicious but I don't think enough was given for the price. The pulled pork sandwich was okay but the sauces they offer were delicious and definitely enhanced the flavor. As for the cornbread at $4 a piece, nothing spectacular but good enough and the Mac cheese was alright.  I think this was just another case of ""hipster hype."" I heard it was good and then when I saw everyone waiting in line for it I thought ""this must be worth it,"" but as hipsters do they make mediocre things cool. Although the food was decent I don't think it was the best BBQ I've ever eaten or the greatest place I've even been. Not sure I would return here for dinner but the space seemed cool to see a band play or to hang out for a drink."	3star
One drunken night after purchasing Trump condoms to support Planned Parenthood (it was a long day), my friends and I end up here for drinks and oysters to end the night. Their cocktails were on point and I loooooove me a good cocktail. I cannot comment on the freshness of the oysters since judgement was impaired by alcohol though I did slurp up a couple of those bad boys. Fries were awesome though that might have just been drunken me thinking that.  We were a fairly large party and they were very accommodating in seating us. We got seated by these moving screen art and all of a sudden, the wall adjacent to us opened. Some people walked out and it closed back into the wall. We all looked at each other not knowing if we had all drank a little too much or if the wall had actually opened. We tried to pull it open but to no avail. We ask our sweet waitress if we were really drunk or if the wall actually opened. To our pleasant surprise, it was a hidden door to a speakeasy, The Grain (a whiskey bar with live music). So of course we NEEDED to get entry to it now. You have to make a reservation since it's a small space and usually they don't allow large groups but they made it work for us (thank you!!!). Great time, great drinks, great atmosphere with hidden walls to speakeasys. :)	5star
Friends and I went at 8pm on a Thursday night. The wait staff was very nice. I had never had a Moscow mule so I figured I would jump on the band wagon & try one. It was straight alcohol & completely overwhelming.  Didn't finish it so a friend tried it & said the same. Then I go the Crab Cakes App and to my surprise by the time I go home I was suffering from food poisoning all through the next morning. Unfortunate because the environment is nice, and the location is convenient. I don't recommend.	1star
I can't believe this place has changed so much in a year.  The last time I visited I was obsessed with their food and the cheap prices for such good quality. Last night I decided to invite my sisters to try because I'm always raving about it. I ordered my usual favorites... Chicken nachos - it had carrots on it which really just didn't make sense to me, barely had any chicken pieces and lacked flavor.  Shrimp tacos - used to be so flavorful, sweet with the mango and spicy with the sauce but the chipotle mayo sauce was nowhere to be found. It was a tortilla with one cut up shrimp and 5 tiny pieces of mango.  Sangria - was actually tasty except for the fact that it's $30 bucks and only serves about two normal size glasses.  They've definitely increased their prices since they now accept credit cards but the quality of food simply went down the drain. I'm so disappointed. This is corona for goodness sake... There are way too many taco stands to be paying $4.00 for a tiny unsatisfying taco.	1star
First of all, SUPER slow service- we waited for 10 minutes to order and it took another 15 minutes to get our smoothies... or what should have been smoothies but instead were bland slushies. After the person had run the fruits through the machine, the glass was half-full (because the person miscalculated how much fruit should go in there) SO she just added some ICE and milk to the glass, ran it again through the blender and VOILA - a $9 slushie. What a scam. Note that this was also at 9:30am on Dec 30th when the building was practically empty and there were third of the usual crowd, so just imagine the wait when you go in on a regular day.	1star
Cute little place in the west vil...but very mediocre brunch food. The menu was actually interesting, but the food didn't match up. The scrambled eggs with mushroom and peas was good, but the poached eggs were below par (under seasoned and bitter greens, also did not come with any side...so it felt incomplete). The spicy fries, and the string beans were just about ok. Also the service was lax - our fries came out after we had finished our brunch dishes, and after inquiring multiple times about the missing portion of our order. When they did finally come out, there was no acknowledgement of the delay. Wouldn't go out of my way to go here.	2star
Coeliacs beware! If you have a gluten allergy, this place is unreliable. I've been told contradicting information from different waiters on what is and isn't gluten free, although I did warn them on the seriousness of my allergy. I suspect the dish I had tonight contained gluten which is disappointing. I can't speak for the other dishes, but the lack of clarity and professionalism on this issue causes a major problem for allergy sufferers. As a side note, I think the kitchen staff have changed since my last visit- quality of the food has gone down, the pad thai was very oily. It looks like a fair few people have recently updated their reviews for similar reasons.	3star
I made a reservation for ten at 9:45, for dinner after an event nearby. We ended up having a couple more people follow us to Taphouse, and we asked the host if we could accommodate the extra people in any way, like taking another separate table, as only one other table in the entire place was taken at the time. The host acted incredulous that we would ask for more seats, and was downright rude about considering any other tables. We were disappointed, and pretty put off by his attitude, but we split the party so we could fit the table and the other people went home. For the entire three hours we stayed, only one other table was taken, leaving the entire back section empty all night. Besides this, the food, drinks, and service were decent. I'm not sure what motivated the host to give us a problem, but it was totally unnecessary, and I can't imagine it's any good for the servers that entire tables are being turned away when the whole seating area is near empty.	2star
Traveling on business and a colleague found this place on Yelp. Not sure who gave it more than 1 star. Service was awful and then the waitress tried to tell me that my corp card was declined. Asked to speak to the manager and she told me she couldn't find him. After he appeared and finally complaining to him about the service and confirming with the credit card company that the charge had been approved, you would think that he would have comped the bill, nope. NEVER AGAIN!!!	1star
All these 5 star reviews must be friends and family of the owners. Our experience here was garbage. We came in and we're sat at a table, there was only 4 other patrons in the restaurant, should of paid attention to the warning signs. We were then ignored by all 6 of the staff members for 10 minutes, after that we just got up and left.	1star
I should, to be fair, let you know that the Cornish Hen, when it finally arrived at my table, was delicious.	2star
"A these 4 starts say, I am truly a fan! ABC Kitchen stood upto my expectations. Would definitely say make reservations ahead coz it is always full! We had reservations for 6:30, I walked expecting the place to be pretty quiet for a 6:30 dinner but there was already a wait for the walk-ins.  We started our dinner with some complimentary house bread and olive oil, which were good. For appetizer we decided on the house made ""Ricotta cheese with Rhubarb compote and grilled bread"" and it was fantastic! The ricotta was just the right texture! It was creamy and not too heavy and with the rhubarb compote being the right sweetness. The grill bread tasted like it was char grilled with herbs. It was a great start! For mains we tried the ""spinach, goat cheese and herbs pizza"" and ""angel hair pasta with saffron, jalapeños, garlic and ricotta"" Both were delicious. The pizza had a good balance of herbs to spinach, spinach was not overpowering the entire flavor of the pizza. The pasta was cooked perfectly and had a good saffron flavor seeping through each bite. We were already full by the time we were done with mains. But the hit of the evening is yet to come. For dessert we went for the ""Salted caramel ice cream with caramelized popcorn and peanuts with hot fudge"" Sundae! And this really made our day! I am not a huge fan of chewy caramel but this ice cream with the dark chocolate fudge was a heavenly combination! The perfect amalgamation of popcorn, peanuts, caramel with chilly ice cream and hot fudge brought a lot of textures and dimensions to each bite. And the quantity is pretty big too! All in all, it was a perfect dinner date! I would love to go again!"	4star
"WE WILL NEVER RETURN!  Worst customer service ever. We were fans for dinner and decided to give brunch a try. First indication of a problem was when the server said they didn't have Bloody Mary's, but we could have the unlimited champagne drinks for $26, which we declined. We ordered food from what appeared to be a nice menu. More than a half hour later, our egg dishes had not arrived, although the bartender managed to check on us for drinks. Finally, I walked over to the host and asked to cash out for my one drink, explaining that we had never received our food. No one bothered to apologize; they just asked, ""you mean you want to cancel your order?""  Even when I got visibly upset, no one apologized--and they still made me pay for my drink!  It's a shame, because we used to like this place and had recommended it several times to friends. Never again."	1star
I love Dutch Freds - the food, drinks, ambiance and service are all stellar.  It's a good spot for a date night, even a first date and most certainly for catching up with friends. The ambiance is beautiful and the music is low enough that you can actually have an audible conversation. I really enjoyed the Thai Deviled Eggs and tacos. Drinks-wise, I usually go for fruity drinks and the Kiss Kiss Bang Bang hit the spot. Loved the blackberry on top too.  I'll definitely be back!	5star
The food here is great, and while the plates/dishes themselves may seem small, are definitely an excellent price. I came here with two, including a friend who is a regular, and she recommended we get 5 dishes, but it really turned out that all we needed was 3 dishes because the food is relatively rich. The truffle mac and cheese was AMAZING. It's actually a great idea, because you don't need a lot of truffle for the flavor to permeate in a baked dish, and the aroma was strong and powerful, working with whatever else was in that dish--some good cheese and seafood? I spilled a bit of it on the table, and picked it up with my chopsticks and put it in my mouth. I have major germaphobia issues, but it was so good I ate it off a public resturant surface . . . The kale salad paired perfectly to cut the richness of the mac and cheese, and was also delicious. It was a little small for a salad though-unless you're sourcing some local organic etc kale, please give it a few more leaves! Crispy chicken: Good but nothing crazy, tastes like a delicately made General Tso's chicken.  Soft shell crab: No good: All fried stuff and I can't taste the crab!!!!! Kimchi Paella: Delicious!!! Good seafood on top and great flavor in the rice. I don't love the slight sour of the kimchi but I think it works.  Wait was long on a weekday (est 45 min, actually took less time I think)-I brought my CoCo tea  (I had to do something during the wait time yo) and they said I couldn't have it but that's normal. All the waitstaff are male, and while I personally feel meh, my friend thinks they are very cute, so that can be an added plus if you're into that!	5star
East Village already has a ton of Japanese spots, not to mention Otafuku which pretty much offers the same three main items: Takoyaki, Okonomiyaki, and Yakisoba. The last time I've been to Otafuku was when they were still at their old location on Stuyvesant Street. In my opinion, DokoDemo is very comparable to the Otafuku from what I remember. I'm not sure how good Otafuku is at their new location since I haven't tried it yet. When I came in during lunch, the restaurant was fairly empty, so you could get in and out pretty quickly. They have some tables, counters, and stools to eat in the restaurant. You order at the cash register and they will bring the food to you at whatever table/counter you choose to sit at. They have an open kitchen so you can watch them prepare all the food while you ate. I saw one person preparing the octopus. Takoyaki - We ordered the 4 balls for $5.75. The takoyaki was very large and soft with tasty pieces of octopus. Only annoying thing for me is they put too much mayo on it. I really dislike mayo, so next time I think I'll have to ask them to not put any mayo at all. Okonomiyaki - For the okonomiyaki, you can choose pork, beef, octopus (+$1.50), or shrimp (+$1.50). My favorite okonomiyaki is from this restaurant in Pittsburgh where they use a lot of cabbage, so the pancake becomes very tender. I was hoping this was the case, but this had more cut up random vegetables and batter, and not too much cabbage. It was still a good pancake. Again, too much mayo.  Yakisoba - For the yakisoba, you can also choose pork, beef, octopus, or shrimp. I liked the taste of the wine in the noodles, but I think I would probably still be hungry after eating this.  Matcha chips - I loved these chips! I think the name is misleading, since it doesn't taste like matcha at all. It tastes more like warm, Lays nori chips. They actually heat up the chips on the grill. It's $2.95 for a plate of chips, which I think is actually cheaper than buying a bag of Lays nori chips from an Asian supermarket. Plus the chips are warm. Cabbage with garlic & soy sauce - We got this to balance out all the carbs we were ingesting. There was so much garlic in the cabbage, but it was very tasty.

I do t like the communal seating where you are on top of your neighbors.  My neighbor just happened to swat a fly that landed right In front of me RIP. I ordered shrimp scampi, but received a small bowl of baby shrimp with tomatoes, I sent it back and added pasta, but was still dissatisfied. I won't be back.	1star
Everything about the bar here sucks. I waited 15 min to even get served but as soon as my friend who is Asian switched spots she got served right away ... maybe just coincidence but anyways I order and she charges my card and then proceeds to make other people's drinks. I don't know if they're just inexperienced bar tenders or rude but it took me 15 more minutes to get a beer... and they were rushing me to sign the bill in the meantime like what in he world. Won't be coming here again	1star
Food here are mediocre if you ask me. The pad lee Mao aka drunkman noodle is overly salty. Oh, don't ask for fish sauce chili, it's $2.00.  I would go to Pam real Thai food instead.	2star
Came here with a friend for a late lunch and thankfully we had a short wait as the place was packed a few hours earlier with a 2+ hr wait for a table for 2 (we arrived at 3 PM and it was a 15 min wait). Once we got seated our server came immediately asking for drinks and if we were ready to order.  My friend needed a few more minutes so she gave us time and didn't make us wait forever to put our orders in. My friend ordered the Jack's Breakfast and I ordered the breakfast bowl with poached eggs. I really enjoyed my bowl as all of the flavors melded together well and the egg and sauce definitely added a nice creamy element to the dish. It isn't the most intimate place, but for a decent brunch spot with simple but flavorful food I recommend it and would come back again.	4star
Incredibly rude hostess.  I can't understand how management allows this.  Great food though!	2star
Man do I miss this place, best Bahn Mi in the NY, NJ, CT, RI, MA area. Not only are the sandwiches 5 star quality so are all the sides, desserts and drinks.  The sandwiches are filling and the variety is off the boards insane. Wish they had a location in MA as they would put shops outta business up here. The quality of their products and the amount of food given leaves you full and yet you still want more because it's just that damn good.    Honestly I wish I could say I have a favorite out of all the choices but it's just too hard. There is a reason when we go we each order 3 sandwiches and fries. Hot, cold, warm doesn't matter the food is crazy good and since they slice them in half sharing is even easier.	5star
This is the most TERRIBLE Experience ... waiter took forever to order and he was rushing us after he came to the table .. food took for ever. When we ask for the manager (a big guy ). He obviously intoxicate ... told us to live if we don't like the service!!! This is so absurd.. i won't recommend this place to nobody ... good look. !!	1star
Finally a great dining option in FiDi! Malt House has a super fun atmosphere with an equally delicious menu. Their burger is amazing, but the must-order on their menu are the fried cheese curds that come with a chipotle mayo that is to die for. I probably could have just eaten those as my meal. Where they lose 2 stars is service. I was here with a group of 6 for a late lunch (meaning it was empty!) and the service was awful. We first ordered a bottle of the Malbec for the table, and our waitress brought out an already-opened bottle, poured it for us, and left without asking for an opinion. I know this isn't a wine bar but that's pretty common practice to uncork the bottle table side and make sure it's to everyones liking. It would have done her well because after she left we realized she had brought a merlot by accident. Once that situation cleared up we had about 4 different waitresses throughout the meal, but when it came time to get the check there was not a waitress in sight. We waited a good hour between finishing our food and receiving the check.	3star
Had brunch here on Father's Day weekend. Even though we had a reservation we had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated. We had ordered a side of mac and cheese to share with our brunches and it was forgotten. She put in the order for it later, not exactly when we wanted it but it still tasted good.	3star
I really didn't want to write a review this low, but I was not impressed by the way certain things were treated during my meal last night.  I will say the food and drinks were good, nothing that blew my mind or that would say you MUST go back to try. Service was inattentive.  We waited about 5-7 minutes after being seated to get water or have our drink order taken.  Then when drinks came I got mine and had to wait a good 5 minutes for my date to have his delivered.  There was no communication from the staff that his drink was on his way, or an apology when it was delivered for the strange timing of delivery. It was at this point that there was a screeching noise from behind us with girls leaping up out of their seat.  This was due to a large cockroach that had crawled up the wall and then on to one of their seats.  I think the manager ended up killing the bug and the girls were re-seated after one would not go back to sit on her side of the booth.   As we were waiting on our entrees my date felt something brush past his elbow and it was another bug that was crawling along the wall under our table.  We got out of our seats and after a couple minutes someone noticed and asked what had happened.  We told them that there was a bug and that it had walked along a planter we were sitting next to.  We were not re-seated or offered much in the way of an apology.  There was no mention of that incident moving forward and they restaurant didn't even go as far to comp on of our two rounds of drinks. Like I said before, the food was decent and I enjoyed the movies playing on the walls, but the inattentive staff and lack of follow up with the bug (HUGE BUG, in case I didn't make that clear before) was disappointing.   If you do go there I would suggest trying to get a seat that is not next to the planter in the main dining area or next to the side brick wall.	2star
Great considerable portions serve! I'm a seafood person, and I been to many seafood restaurants. I can honestly say this restaurant would be one of my favorite (top 5), the ample amount of food with great various seasoning.  Recommend: - Snow crab legs - King crab legs  In any styles, because everything tastes so fresh and meaty! - Clam casinos are one of my favorite here because it's different from other place. Red peppers, dice tomatoes with bacon on top & lot of butter I do suggest to come to this place in groups, because of the portions sizes. You can try different variety from each other plates without wasting food.	3star
Definitely a tourist place due to the location duh! I come here strictly for the cheesecake! Doesn't matter which one you pick it; it'll hit the spot! I had the Fresh Strawberries Cheesecake today and last time I had the red velvet. Since I'm in town, I might convince my boyfriend to come back again before I leave.	3star
"Visited NYC & was recommended to come here. I had no idea it was associated with Iron Chef Morimoto so I was extra pleased. We ordered Zuke Maguro (Soy marinated tuna, tataki cucumber, taberu rayu), braised pork belly bao, & ramen (tonkotsu, tantan, tsukemen). Everything was photo friendly.  My favourite was zuke maguro tuna sashimi. It was fresh, light and flavourful. The bao fell short for us. The bun was soft but the pork belly flavour was bland. From the Ramen, my 3 family members preferred the mildly spicy tantan because of the coconut flavour. Personally, I preferred the tsukemen because I enjoy dipping the noodles in a more concentrated soup base. It also has a more traditional broth flavour compared to the tantan. * it's pricey but you should order the Peking duck ""taco"""	4star
"I would pass on this place...I read other reviews, so, I felt excited to have dinner here.  Upon entering, the smell of the Holiday evergreens did little to mask the unpleasant odor of a sewer, an actual sewage smell permeated the restaurant, as if there was a plumbing back up...needless to say, this was our first clue on what was to come...even my husband said that the place smelled like a ""fish tank"" and, we all know this is NOT a fish restaurant... After checking our coats, we were treated so rudely by one of the people working at the front.  While they see very busy, the food is not remarkable, the management disregarded a request made by our hotel's Concierge, and, there are too many better restaurants in the City to go here.  Try BLT Steaks or Charlie Palmers."	1star
I've heard great reviews about this place, so I decided to give it a try. I visited on a Sunday afternoon. It was pretty busy inside.  Mostly all the tables were taken.  The line to order your food was long and slow. Thank goodness I was on the line with friends, otherwise I would have been aggravated. Once at the front of the line, the guy taking the order was actually fast and efficient. The lady preparing the sides and collecting the money was nice enough to let me sample 2 of the sides to see if I liked it before I bought. I had the collard greens and the macaroni and cheese. They were both good!!! For the meats, I bought some brisket,  pulled pork and the jerk baby back ribs. Everything looked so good so i had to sample everything LOL.  My only complaint about the meat would be the temperature.  It was not NOT hot at all. They have the meat sitting out, so by the time you eat it, it's room temperature.  I like hot food!! The brisket was good and so was the pulled pork, but I couldn't enjoy enjoy it because of the temperature. The jerk baby back ribs were great. Not too much of a spicy,  overpowering jerk taste but definitely great!!! Nice and tendeDrinks could be better!! My margarita was small and weak!!Very disappointing. I did order a root beer, which was the best I've EVER tasted!!! Overall, I had a great experience at Hometown BBQ.  I will definitely return in the future!!	4star
I came here with my boss for a Friday lunch. We made reservations but it wasn't necessary. Crowd is a very old and professional crowd. Overall, food was solid but it didn't wow me. Moreover, customer service is slooooowwwwwwww.  Once we were seated, our waiter didn't show up for maybe 5-10 minutes. This sucked because were STARVING. When he did show up, he didn't introduce himself and he seemed distracted. I felt that his service skills were overall lacking, which is a vast difference from the service I've experienced over at Benjamin's (owned by the same person). Anyway, he brought bread and a delicious garlicy butter spread until our food was ready. We ordered:  a dozen east oysters scallops - only 2 pieces FYI tuna entree (me) - was good but only 4 bite-sized pieces doesn't justify that price. Comes with bok choy.  swordfish entree (boss) - tried a piece and it was delicious.  cream of spinach - loved it. Made for a great dip for our fries. cabernet sauvignon cheesecake - YUMMM.  Like another Yelper said, food was solid, service was lacking.	3star
Awful!! Don't come here!! Food is disgusting, flavorless, overcooked, and awful proportions. Service is rude. What a astronomical waste of money.	1star
Brunch. How old were my home fries? Hard desiccated little mummies. Toast so stiff the sort of nearly over easy egg yoke couldn't penetrate. I had to go inside (after the food was slammed down and the server spun away so fast she couldn't hear my request) to retrieve my own salt and pepper. Maybe  it was an off day.  Good flow of coffee. Good veggie sides. But I will not go back for brunch. I have had excellent dinners there.	2star
Came here on a Friday night for some post-dinner drinks.  I appreciated the fact that this place is fairly new so the condition of the place is great - bathrooms are clean, the bar is well-kept, and the service is not bad.  It was not crowded at all so we were able to find a table quickly.  The cocktail that my friend got wasn't too tasty, but he got a recommendation from the waitress so maybe it was just a mismatch of desired flavor profiles.  Regardless, the name of the cocktail escapes me, but it just wasn't memorable for either of us.  He ended up getting his usual old fashion, which seem to be better than the cough-syrupy tasting cocktail he got.  I'm still a fan of this place because of all the other potentials on their cocktail menu, as well as their beer selection.  I recently discovered my enjoyment of Delirum Tremens beer which is served ice cold in a sophisticated, European beer glass.  There was too much foam on the top, but maybe they were running low on the tap so it came like that.  Again, the service was attentive and the whole area being pristine and new appeals to me so I would definitely be back to try out their food selection as well.	4star
"Went here with a few friends because we were craving Korean food like crazy haha. I gave it 3 stars not because of anything terrible that happened during the dinner nor was the food terrible, but because it's simply too pricey for Korean food for me (I'll give it a solid 3.5 stars). I think a good way to summarize the whole experience is that you're definitely paying extra for the frills. The interior of the place has an intimate, romantic feel. Can definitely see this place as a good place to go on a date (the price certainly justifies it lol). We joked that the high ceilings definitely account for the second $ lol. I got the eel bap and we shared a large seafood scallion pancake. The food was pretty good and hearty - none of us left there hungry, which is great considering most expensive places only give you just enough or less. However, there ended up being more rice than eel on my bap (like 2.5:1 ratio), so I had to ration the eel throughout the meal. The funniest thing we saw is that on the menu, it actually says ""with chef's artistic sensibility."" We honestly don't know what that supposed to even mean. We figured it's just another thing to tack on the second $ haha. The overall experience ended up being a little too pretentious for us. I'd rather keep it simple when it comes to Korean food (this is the first time that I paid $20 for Korean food, and it didn't have the word ""unlimited"" before it lol)."	3star
Just had the most disappointing lic meal in 2 years.  Seated next to us was a loud, vulgar man in his fifties with a shy, meek woman. This man proceeded to drop f- bombs, SOBs and douche bags repeatedly while at least 4 tables looked around  in disbelief. We mentioned this to our  waiter Jose who was useless and avoided us after we complained.  Afterwards the usually competent manager came by to apologize only to us since I complained for the 4 surrounding tables.  The other tables were all annoyed and shared looks of annoyance with us. We weren't offered a free glass of wine or dessert for our discomfort. Following this incident we waited 30 minutes for our homemade pasta entrees in a 60% capacity dining room. Our disbelief continued as the manager averted us as we left.  Apparently the obnoxious customer is a regular and his behavior is more acceptable than the 12 people he irritated.  So glad we have Masso, Testachio and Bella Vie to frequent from now on.	1star
"I was hovering from 2 to 2.5 stars.  I pushed my friend to take the trek to momosan since I was overall impressed with the reviews.  But unfortunately this place didn't impress me.  Seating: Got here on a Saturday around 10 pm, place was still booming with customers but was able to get a seat at the bar very quickly.  Parties of 1-2 are designated to the bar while parties of 3-4 are designated to the tables.  The bar seating wasn't very comfortable, the stools are not moveable so I often had to awkwardly slide in and out.  A larger person or someone with thicker legs will definitely experience some trouble. I was seated at the edge of the bar, there's a swinging door and employees often crowded right next to me while talking to each other or went in and out the bar.  The door often swung violently since workers are in a rush.   One employee got hit by the door and she hurriedly walked away saying ""ouch"" under her breath.  You know that unwanted table in restaurants next to the swinging kitchen door...?  My seat is probably the equivalent to that. Food/Drinks: This is clearly more of a bar than a restaurant, so there's no other drinks other than alcohol available.  There's no tea or other non alcoholic beverages, so I stuck with water (which had something floating in it...) Ramen came super quick, I ordered a tonkotsu while my friend had the Tokyo chicken.  The person who took our order almost messed up assuming we both were getting tonkotsu but that disaster was inadvertently avoided.  The broth I got wasn't as oily as others indicated so I was okay with it, both the Tokyo chicken and tonkotsu broth had good flavor.   The proportion of ramen was a bit small for me, the chashu was sliced to about 2-3 mm thickness----very thin and there's only 3 pieces, the chashu was tender though.   I also ordered 1 Peking duck taco, it was yummy but VERY tiny for $5.  The sauce is sweet and had a fruity note to it.  Duck was moist and juicy and paired well with the crispy fried wonton outter shell.  A person sitting down the bar ordered gyozas which smelled phenomenal, but 4 pieces for $10 will break my heart and my wallet.  I'm the type who never finishes her dish and ends up with leftovers.  But I left here hungry... Although the broth was overall good, it didn't win me over.  There's other ramen places in the city to fulfill your ramen needs.  I was hoping to get a t-shirt but the design is not really appealing, I legit love watching Morimoto on TV but momosan wasn't worth bragging about through a tshirt. Overall I do not recommend dining here for a legit meal like dinner, maybe it's an okay place if you just want to bar hop and want sustenence for the alcohol.  I think it's also better to come here during lunch hours since there's lunch specials."	2star
Came here at 1 pm and man it was crowded. We waited for 15 minutes before we got a table. Beware - you might get seated on a bigger table with other strangers looking at you eat. It's normal for a Chinese restaurant though. We ordered the combo set  1) Hong Kong noodle soup with beef brisket and fish ball: the noodles weren't that great, I've tasted better. The soup was OK for me but I didn't enjoy the beef brisket at all. Even though they did give an abundance of beef, most of it were tendons which I didn't like and a lot were fat. The fish ball barely tasted like fish - just plain flour. The fish cake is however, a lot better. 2) Dry Hong Kong noodles with wonton and beef brisket: Noodles were a little too hard and the sauce was not authentic. The sauce lacks the normal kick that usual Hong Kong noodles have. The wontons are alright, a bit dry.  3) hot soy milk - tastes good but over priced	3star
"Their cocktail, ""The Secret Garden,"" deserves 4 stars!  It's a lovely blend Vodka, St. Germain, lime, cucumber, mint, which makes for a refreshing surprise in your mouth.  I can't drink cocktails that taste two strong so I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to drink.  Yet, it must have been super strong because one almost put me under - I actually didn't finish it.  Now, I rarely drink, am petite, and hadn't eaten dinner yet... but still... it must have been strong!   The space is beautiful - everything is custom made - bar, seats, everything!  I particularly liked the menus, which are random books that they inserted their menu into.   The food was pretty good - we had the ""big eggs, little eggs,"" which are deviled eggs topped with caviar, a meat/cheese plate, and a grilled cheese."	3star
If these guys got a Michelin Star, then I'm opening a restaurant and getting 3.  Food was bland. Maggie W, who reviewed it before me was spot on with her review. The drinks looked great, but tooooo sweet. The guacamole was okay. Nowhere near mindblowing or the best I've ever had.  The enchiladas were super tangy/sour. Not enjoyable.  If you want the BEST TACOS in town, head over to Los Mariscos on 15th Street next to the Chelsea Market in Meatpacking and thank me later.  The good things here are the ambiance, service, ceviche and prices. Will not come back again. Cannot recommend.	2star
Craving for some Shanghaiese foods? This place might do it for you if you don't know much about authentic Shanghaiese foods. I'm 100% Shanghaiese so I know what and how it should be.  Their xiao long bao is way too big! It is juicy indeed, but the flavor is totally off. All the other dishes are mediocre. I'm not saying I've tried all of it but giving this restaurant 3 shots is more than enough to know this is not authentic at all. Is it good? Yes. Is it authentic? No.  They get really busy here so try not to come during peak hours as you'll be waiting forever. Get ready to share tables with strangers as the restaurant itself isn't too big. It is totally about the hype. Come and try it so you'll be able to tell everyone you've tried it.	3star
I came here on a Friday night with a girlfriend, we didn't wait, and the waitress was very sweet. We ordered the flights drink, mushroom and cheese bruschetta, truffle oil and truffle cheese thin bread, fried baby artichoke with rosemary and cheese, and gnocchi ricotta.  Flights drink: 3 half cups of wine category of your choice. I ordered the sparkling wine category and my friend ordered the white wine category. They actually do give a lot, it's the same portion as other restaurants' normal wine portion.  Mushroom and cheese bruschetta: 4 small pieces, very flavorful and they do pack each bread with lots of ingredients. Truffle oil and truffle cheese thin bread: it comes in a mountain pile form. Each thin bread contains lots of truffle oil and truffle cheese. Toward the end, it became very salty.  Fried baby artichoke with rosemary and cheese: it's an interesting texture. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Same problem with the truffle thin bread, it became very salty toward the end. Probably because of the truffle cheese and the salt combination.  Gnocchi ricotta: waitress recommended this dish stating it was the most popular item on the menu. It was nothing special. It was just gnocchi covered in cheese and cream sauce. It taste good, but nothing special.  Overall, I will return back and have the flights drink again with other appetizers.	4star
Amazing Food! And Drinks Too! But The Waitress Are Too Friendly. I Hate When I Ho To A Place And Someone I Don't Know Keeps Calling Me Baby? I Don't Know You! This Is A Fine Dinning Place Too???

Good food but horrible service Glad they are at larger location because less wait time for table but this just gives servers more tables to juggle  Recommend any poboy	4star
Looking for brunch in UWS? Stop where you are and head to Calle Ocho. Your fabulous brunch experience here will include: - bottomless sangria with no additional price (you read that correctly) -complimentary bread basket with buñuelos (chewy bread balls), and decadent pain au chocolat and banana/chocolate muffins - tasty entrees, which are very generous portion wise (order anything with beef and eggs and you wont be sorry. The eggs are cooked to perfection and the beef is v tender) The entrees are all around $3-5 pricier than you would see at neighboring brunch spots, but as you just read, you get bottomless sangria and a beautiful bread basket with your meal with no add on price.  Do you realize how good of a deal this is??? However your meal here will not include: - a quiet, serene atmosphere -a healthy portion of vegetables in your entree  But, who needs those things anyways? Plus, the interior deco is warm and inviting, and the menu has a good sense of humor if you read closely :)	4star
Ordered delivery twice from here , first order was poorly packed thankfully nothing wasn't in any type of sauce because it would've been a disaster. Food was ok , nothing amazing.  Second delivery decided to try the Lomo saltado... WHY, WHY DID I DO THIS TO MYSELF.... Everything in the containers spilled probably because the delivery person thought it was a good idea to carry it upside down (maybe it this is a new thing they're doing , efficiency? aerodynamics?? idfk)  So here I sit with a sloppy plastic bag sauce disaster. Happy Friday!	1star
Look, I don't write yelp reviews ever, but today's experience was so egregious that it warrants a rant. For a super popular brunch spot, the hostesses here have the absolute worst crowd control I've ever seen. When the rain forced everyone in the queue I to the restaurant, all hell broke loose. There were like twenty people standing around the hostess' table; bus boys, waiters, and departing guests had to push their way through the crowd to get anywhere. I got my SMS notification that my table was ready, told a hostess who told me to wait and then immediately forgot about it. In the end, I almost got into an argument with other people in line about who should get the next table because of how ridiculous the situation is. Never again.	1star
The hype is real folks.  Went to Sugar Freak for the first time today.  The wait was an hour but that is pretty standard on a Sunday at 1pm.  Their new location (I had never been to the original across the street) is extremely detailed in decor.  I can tell every inch of every  wall, table, plate, etc was handpicked.    It all looks amazing and made me feel like were in a southern mom and pop on the bayou.  The staff was prompt to bring water followed immediately by the server who took drink and app orders.  The hush puppies were tasty and sweeter than we expected.    I went with the crab cakes benedict with hash brown bake.  Hands down the best creole sauce and crab cakes I have ever had in NYC.   I tried nibbles of my friends mac and cheese.  Delicious!  Their biscuits are soft and you can tell made from scratch.    I can't wait to go back and try the lobster boil for dinner and fried oysters!	4star
My co-worker orders from the restaurant in mid-town. I had a taste of her food. One day I decided to eat at the restaurant in the Bronx. I wasn't thrilled. For one , it took time for a service to come to my table. I saw the waiters standing around chatting. The food was ok. I ordered The half chicken, rice and beans and sweet plantains. The plantain were burnt and dry. I should have sent it back. But, I was so turned off by the service. I decided to not go back at all. The price is reasonable. But why did they serve a customer burnt , dry food. Something they wouldn't eat themselves . I'll patronize the restaurant on the city. I'm not going back.	2star
Classy and cozy enviroment and very welcoming service. They have also delicious wine. I got there turkey sandwich once and unfortunatelly it was not very good. On the other hand the caesar salad was fine.	4star
Yo.. this was a great meal. I heard good things about the chicken here, but it took me a long time to finally try it. No nonsense chicken. Just good stuff. Flavor, crispy, and with a little hot sauce, pretty damn great. The biscuit is the best biscuit I've ever had. Flaky, buttery, and soft in the center.  Wash it all down with an Arnold Palmer that edges more on the sour side. Great banana cream pie + bourbon pecan pie.	5star
45 min wait on a Sunday. Not as bad as I expected since it was a weekend and this place is rated so well.  It was my first time having pizza in New York. I wasn't completely wowed at first bite, but the more I ate it, the more I started to really like it. It's a solid pizza that you can tell is really good quality.  I got the #4. I would totally get it again! The arugula goes really well with the pizza cause it balances out the saltiness of the ham.  If I ever come back to New York, I would love to come here again and try the other pizza.  TMI, but i got a stomach ache and desperately needed the restroom right after eating here. I usually have a stomach of steel so I don't know what it could have been. It wasn't just me either!! Despite this, I'd still wanna come back :D	4star
Wow! Among the endless pizza and deli restaurants it was great to find this awesome Cuban fusion bistro right in the middle of Brooklyn NY. I felt like I was transported to little Havana in Miami Florida, the decor was exactly what you what expect with the Caribbean flair and ambiance of an old world Cuban cafe. It was a total unique dining experience not only because of its style and equally outstanding food but the kitchen was outside in the huge patio area in an old food truck which seemed to be attached to the side of the building. Totally cool! We came for lunch, so of course we had the Cuban sandwich and we also had a few specialty steak and chicken tacos. The service was also friendly and attentive. The only negative is they have no AC and maybe they could use a few more fans to move the air around inside on the hot summer days, thankful they do have high ceilings to trap the real hot stuff . However, that didn't sway me from giving 4 stars for everything else. I highly recommend this place if you are here in NYC for a visit, and if it's a little warm that day it's well worth that trade off.	4star
The food and sangria were great, but they rushed us. We paid the check, but weren't done with our drinks, and they asked us to move to the bar so they could seat people. Except there was no one waiting for a table and there were at least two other free tables.	2star
Came with a group of friends on a Friday night and was seated quickly although my entire party did not arrive yet. Service was great and food came out in a timely manner. I ordered chicken and waffles and this may be my new favorite spot for just that.  There was more than enough chicken to accompany my waffles and normally, I would finish off the chicken before the waffles. Will be returning soon!	5star
It was a beautiful sunny day so a few friends and I decided to come to Trading Post for lunch. They have lots of seating, outdoor and indoor, so you can easily have a long relaxing lunch (though the lunch will be extra long partially because service takes forever). I had the Local Kale Salad with Smoked Salmon. The salad was fine, but considering how much extra the salmon costs, I expected more than just one piece of salmon carefully shredded into microscopic pieces in the salad. You couldn't even taste it. The kale was fresh and tasty, but the salad was not worth the money. I then ordered ice cream. I picked flavors off the sundae menu, but said that I wanted just the ice cream. My friend ordered ice cream with toppings. After 30 minutes, our waiter came back and told us that they were out of most of the flavors. So then we reordered. And waited another 30 minutes. So after an hour of waiting, we finally get our ice cream. Both of us got ice cream with lots of brownies, which was confusing since the menu didn't even mention brownies. I guess you shouldn't say no to free brownies, but they killed the flavor of the ice cream and were mediocre. And then we had to wait another 30 minutes for the check. The food here is fine, but considering the prices and wait, you can do better.	2star
"I used to love this place. However, coming back now since it's nice outside again the rooftop has a great view we decided to go again (reason why the 2 stars).  The experience wasn't desirable at all. They ran out of pizza dough and had to wait for them to make a new batch for 45min. You'd think a Pizzeria is ready and have enough for the day.  Then the Bar, what a disaster! They added more tables this year which mean it's overcrowded now. The bartenders were scattered and inattentive. One of the people on my party got overcharged and my credit card went missing. I had to cancel my card because they couldn't find it and still attempted to make the charge. One of the bartender even told me it wasn't ""a biggie."" It wasn't for her as she isn't the one that have to change all of her payments and update the information.  I can take ok food with great service, but can't take bad service. You can get great food anywhere in the city, so what set most places apart is the attention and atmosphere, which this place is quickly losing."	2star
Delicioussssss and GREAT prices! The $12 6 oysters and beer happy hour is so good. I can't believe that exists actually - that is some great quality for the price. Can't find deals like this with the quality oysters they have anywhere in SF or NYC. (Only prices in New Orleans beat this!) Oysters were super fresh!!! Very impressed. The seafood entrees are all less than $20 which amazes me, as an SF local, because any of those dishes would average $25-$30 in the bay. The fettuccine with clam had huuuuuge clams if you're a fan of those. Super garlicky and cheesy fettuccine - got a little hefty after a while, but if you want that kind of salty, cheesy, flavorful comfort pasta, this is the choice. The mushroom risotto was my faaaaaave. Omg just thinking about it makes me want it again. The risotto pasta was perfectly textured - not too soggy like it's like mushy oatmeal but not too hard. It was perfectly textured, and the flavor was so mushroomy!! I expected little chopped up mushrooms but there were actually whole delicious juicy mushrooms in the risotto. So good. Crab cakes were also perfectly slightly fried on the outside so you get a little crunch biting into it, rich in flavor, not dry at all. Paired perfectly with the dressing on the salad it comes with.	5star
"Open tables. Was sat by the hostess: myself and 2 friends. We were Then told we couldn't sit and had to move. Table stayed open for 20min. They had the nerve to say another specific tableI was going to be opening any minute- those people just had full plate of food. I don't understand why they wouldn't let us sit at the table they sat is us at originally and make money off the table. Manager did not handle the situation with grace. Next time I go in there my motto is going to be, ""is it safe to sit?"""	2star
"The way they treat *certain* customers is DISGUSTING. I will NEVER darken their doorstep again. I called to place an order for pick up at 1:08. They told me it would be 20 minutes. No problem. I leave the office at 1:30 and take the 4 minute walk over.  At 1:50 I still hadn't been ACKNOWLEDGED as a human being waiting a their counter, even though I watched that nasty chick and the dude either acknowledge or service other customers. When I said to the chick, ""I've been standing here, waiting to be acknowledged,"" the FIRST thing out of her mouth was, ""We're not Shake Shack!"" Huh? What? What the hell does Shake Shack have to do with treating people like they EXIST? When I ask her why she is bringing up Shake Shack she claims she wasn't talking to me or about me. What am I, stupid? So then why are you making direct eye contact and addressing ME? Then she says, ""Give me a freaking minute, you see I'm making sandwiches."" WOW!  She was right - My Cuban Spot is NOT Shake Shack.  At Shake Shack they treat their customers like human beings who deserve a little bit of kindness, respect and dignity.  At Shake Shack not only do they serve quality food, but they do so at a reasonable pace - they don't have you waiting for 50 minutes for ONE order (a rice bowl).  At Shake Shack, they would never dream of lashing out at the customer for what is actually the restaurant's own mistake.  That chick has a rotten attitude and I will NEVER patronize this restaurant ever again. You lost a customer for life. It's now 2:08 and still haven't eaten. Thank you for completely ruining my lunch hour."	1star
I brought my friends there and it was our first time to Rubirosa. I found this place as NY top 5 pizza place from TripAdvisor. Considering that ranking, pizza here was definitely not satisfactory. All of cheese/crust/sauce were not met with my expectation.	2star
"I've been meaning to come to clover club basically since it opened, and finally made it there last nigh! Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was disappointed in the rigid cocktail service. I ordered a happy house Moscow mule at the bar ($8 -amazing happy hour deal!) and really enjoyed it, but it was sweet. That's OK. Moscow mules can be sweet. We moved to a table where I looked at the post-happy hour menu only to discover there was not a single vodka-based-cocktail on it. When I explained to the waitress that I wanted a not-as-sweet vodka-y cocktail she was about as condescending as can be. She said they are a ""gin-forward"" cocktail bar and they don't have any vodka cocktails. (Never-mind the fact that I has just ordered a vodka cocktail from their bar). After saying I can get woozy if I mix booze-y she begrudgingly relented and said if I haaaaad to I could substitute vodka for gin in a drink from the menu, but it would ""totally change the flavor composition"" or something like that. I'm really used to high-end cocktail bars with super-talented bar tenders who ask you what kind of flavors you're in the mood for, and can make you a delightful drink to accommodate your wishes in that very moment! I would have appreciated it if our waitress could have at least suggested SOMETHING vodka based. Tell me to order a vodka martini or suck it up and get another Moscow mule. I don't care. Just don't tell me there's nothing here for me to drink. I ended up not getting a second drink I was so put-off by the experience. It's a lovely atmosphere but I might not be back."	2star
Japanese comfort food is comforting, fo sho.  - Came here for a group dinner -- they take reservations!  - Get the UNA-TAMA DON! Eel and EGG and sauce and rice... mmmmmmm... So flavorful, so good! Yes, it's a little pricier than your usual eel don place (do you have one, by the way?), but it's so delicious and comforted me in ways I never imagined.  - Tuna tataki for appetizer -- that sauce yo.  - Dessert!!!!!! Black sesame pudding was good and I don't even like black sesame.  Small place, definitely make reservations!	4star
As part of my trip to NY, my boyfriend and I wanted to go big one night and splurge on some amazing steak. Unfortunately, we did not have such an experience here.  We were able to make reservations quite easily for calling in only one day before. Service was accommodating and friendly.  Food was mediocre. What's sad is that the side dishes stole the show for us when it really should have been the steaks. My boyfriend and I both asked for our steaks to be medium rare, but when it was presented to us, it was still raw in the middle. It was more rare than it was medium rare, so we had to send it back to cook a bit more. When it came back, it hit the point of no return. It was then medium well instead of what we orginially asked for... Bummer... My favorite dish that we ordered was actually the king crab gnocchi. It was so creamy and rich and the gnocchi was soft and melted in your mouth. I wish it had more king crab in it though. The creamed spinach was also pretty good. We also ordered the beef carpaccio and we thought it was okay.  Overall, for being such an expensive restaurant, we expected better quality food. You can honestly get way better steak at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse for a lower price. i would not recommend this steakhouse to anyone.	2star
Amazing thai ice tea, great bear, amazing red curry, great steak, roti canai is solid and chicken buns. 5 stars!! Amazing fast service too.... Didn't try the dessert but enjoyed the food greatly!	5star
Sorry, nowhere near as good as the other locations. Croquet were served cold in the middle! Tortilla was bland. Vibe here is much closer to a food court in a mall.	1star
#2 Lemongrass chicken - It was okay. Felt like it could've been better. #6 Kakuni pork belly -Very delicious. Lots of flavor, but a little too fatty. Although it's a little fatty, it's still my favorite sandwich from Joju so far. #17 Lin sanity - Way too spicy for me. It's also a very messy sandwich. Too wet. Sauce was dripping everywhere! Fries - Very very delicious. Crispy! Love it! Goes good with their spicy mayo sauce.	4star
I loveeee this place the salt and pepper shrimps are amazing.. The flavor and texture were a perfect combination with a tab of spice that I loved!!! And the foie gras was just as yummy nice and greasy with in egg that I must say was a great combo love this place and the drinks are not bad but I'm obsessed with the food - the waiter's and bus boys were very attentive alway a plus :))) I'm coming back with a s$&@of my friends	5star
One of the best brunch spots in Brooklyn. Their side Cheesy Grits is mouth watering. I just wish it came a couple sizes bigger. Their baked Mac n Cheese is another favorite of mine. My friend ordered the red velvet waffles with chicken, Chicken and waffles. I must say he was more excited about the Piece of Chicken and less about the Waffles. There is a back of the house area with a sun roof and it makes you feel like your out side without actually being outside which I love because I quiver at the sight of flying insects. Great Food, Amazing Ambiance, whether your Eating for 1,2 4 , 5 or more .... it's worth the wait. Happy Eating!	5star
Went here with a friend, at her recommendation, since she had tried it before with some of her friends and enjoyed it. We started with curry puffs and Thai steamed dumplings, followed by chicken Pad Thai and Kow Soy. I cannot say that any one of the dishes impressed us. We were both very disappointed and will probably not return. What I don't get is the place was packed, with a waiting line, when we left. Perhaps we should have ordered something else, but four out of four disappointments is too much. Service was good though.	2star
Their C grade is kinda obscured by the sliding door, and I was suckered by food press into forking over a ridiculous $17.45 for their fried chicken sandwich, which somehow took 18 minutes to emerge for takeout. Also wondering if you need to drop $20 here to deserve a napkin to go with the messy chicken sandwich.  Every member of the FOH staff was on their phone, so maybe that was the hold-up in the back too. A second star only because the sandwich was solid.	2star
Service is really tough ! We waited 30 minutes for appetizers. Another 30 minutes for our main entree. And another 30 minutes for dessert.  Literally 2 whole hours at this restaurant and not because we were talking simply service. The papa rellena was delicious come with 2 potatoes. Papa a la huacaina is not typical one as it comes in tri color potatoes which makes a difference. Unfortunately the Lomo was horrible. It was extremely salty ! The sauce is not the regular sauce. We have been to many Peruvian restaurants and that's not how it taste. Our waitress was very mean and it just felt like we were bothering her the whole time. Small request couldn't be done.  We mainly got filled with the plantain chip and drinks.  They need to be more descriptive on their menu.	2star
We tried 1803 with a group of 8. They seated us on balcony. Superior service from Karen. Shared many apps, especially enjoyed grilled oysters, ceviche, fried green tomatoes, spinach dip, chicken wings. Jambalaya (some got veggie version) very good. Catfish very good. Arugula salad tasty. Big burger. Most had wine and beer but one tried Hurricane for that New Orleans experience.  For us, a festive, yet comfortable spot with nice food tastes, pretty environment, and a very reasonable price point. We thought green sauce hotter than red!	4star
The décor is great and the outside in the back is a great place to have a convo with a friend. The drinks can be better but the bartenders are super nice. Also, the seafood is amazing and the guys cooking are sweet.  Great Neighborhood bar :)	3star
"I spent $1000+ dollars for a dinner reservation with friends on New Years Eve. They changed some of the menu items on me without telling me ahead of time but we were there to have a good time and we never mentioned it to the reservationists. Food was good and the staff was nice.  I came back on a slow Wednesday night in June with two friends for a drink at the bar. The Doorman told us they were ""fully committed."" (Mind you it was a ghost town) He told us that you need to book tables for dinner months in advance. (Never asked) Open table says they have open availability the rest of the evening. The Maitre'd told me on the phone that they not only have open tables for reservations but that the bar was not at capacity. I work in hospitality and nightlife. I get it. The blatant lie and the added insult of false information is in poor taste of the establishment and more so to the people who spend money at the establishment frequently. We were adequately dressed for La Esquina and it was insulting after my previous patronage.  If you want to grab drinks, or try to, at a pretentious establishment with an ill-informed and egotistical doorman, then I would highly recommend La Esquina. My only regret is spending my money at this place and I promise to not make that mistake again. I will not be bringing guests back to La Esquina in the future."	1star
Have you ever yelp-ed another restaurant while you were sitting in a restaurant because your food and service was that terrible?  I have an egg allergy, understandable that certain things will be off the menu for me but, the service on top of it was terrible too. So, only thing I could have ordered other than salad were home fries and sausage links that were so dry it looked as if they were cooked yesterday. (Well, I can't speak for the home fries because she accidentally put in French fries and I just had to deal) The server could visibly see I was displeased so she never once came over to ask how my food was.  Avoiding the situation doesn't make it go away.  Hilariously enough, when she brought the check for food and saw how irritated I was she sent a bus boy to hand it back to me.  God I would do ANYTHING to have spent that $16.00 on a vodka martini instead of bad food. I rated it two stars for the ambience.	2star
Came here on a Sunday before President's Day for dinner with friends. We had a reservation for 6 pm, but unfortunately one of our companions was running a bit tardy. We requested to be seated at 6:30 with our friend's eta around 5 mins. We browsed the menu while we waited for our friend to arrive. Within a few minutes of menu browsing,  a dark haired shoulder length cut lady dressed in pants suit came to our table. Assuming she was a floor manager of some sort and kindly informed us that is our friend didn't arrive anytime soon she would need to have our table vacated by 8:45pm. Seriously lady? You felt the need to ruin our evening meal with friends by stating that?  I have dined at other Michelin rated restaurant's before and two thing stands out the most, Food and service. As a two star rated, this is very unprofessional to even mention that to your patrons. A paying patrons whose dinner bill is close to $1000!!! So thank you lady, you ruined the experience for me. I hope you roll your ankle somewhere. ***Woosaaahhhh*** For dinner we opted for the pre fixe menu and i chose the following. Tasting of three crudo: Polipo (octopus), Seppia (cuttlefish) and Sgombro(pacific jack mackerel) Polipi appetizer: Grilled octopus, smoked potatoes, radish with picked onions, chili and tomatoes Agnolotti: milk braised veal, sweetbreads and funghi Aragosta: butter poached lobster, root veggies, apples, leeks and lovage. Panna Cotta: coconut panna cotta, mango, kiwi passion fruit. The crudo were ok, nothing really stood out as something exceptional and found it under seasoned to almost bland.  The grill octopus was a winner, big portion and cooked to perfection. The veggie combinations worked beautifully to compliment the beautifully cooked octopus. it was a pleasure on the palate. This was followed by Agnolotti, silky smooth sweetbreads with mushrooms in a  rich creamy sauce. It was delicious without being too overbearing in flavor with the right amount of serving leaving you to crave for more.  Arragosta, tender succulent and perfectly cooked lobster balanced with root veggies. The offset of these hardy root veggies kept the richness of the butter poached lobster at bay without overwhelming the taste buds. Panna Cotta: Ordered mixed up and they brought espresso nougat instead. Had them replace it with the correct order. Clean tasting panna cotta with mango and passion fruit helps in rounding up the meal without being too filling. Overall, it was a nice meal with the grilled octopus being the stand out dish. Pet peeves: Why bother doing a pre fixe menu then start nickle and dime your patrons with supplementary charges on certain dishes? I'd rather have you increase the pre fixe price than do that. Even with the supplementary charges added to the pre fixe price, it is still a considerable savings and value. Don't cheapen the experience by nickle and diming.  Lastly, There was period in between our meals where we waited for 10 minutes , the tardiness of our party could have been made up in between servings, THERE WAS JUST NO JUSTIFICATION TO RUIN AN EXPERIENCE BY TELLING US WE WOULD NEED THE TABLE VACATED AT A PARTICULAR TIME!!!!!! Despite the delicious food I had that night at Marea, the unprofessional conduct of the floor manager left a bitter taste in my mouth.	2star
Place: the place is really narrow. It is a hallway of dining tables. It's different from most dimsum places that I've seen where workers would move around with carts of food. I guess with it's small space, they decide to just give you a paper menu and check off how much you want of each dish. Takes away from the cultural fun experience but is definitely a more efficient way. The good thing is that they have a lot of electrical outlets so you won't need to worry about charging your phone. Service: the man who took my order messed up my and another table's orders. He couldn't keep good track of who ordered what. Like dude, I get it. It's a lot of orders, but still, you could use a pencil and paper to write it down. Or just use the sheets we wrote on. The woman was more attentive; she refilled my water consistently and kept good track of me and other customers such as picking up our empty plates etc. Food: The food I have to say was pretty good. I ordered the turnip cake and the chicken feet. Both were pretty flavorful. I was a bit surprised about the chicken feet since a couple of places that I've eaten in didn't really serve good chicken feet. Theirs was pretty tasty and was juicy and more firm than other dimsum places I've got to.  Price: Unfortunately, compared to other dimsum places I've gone to, they're more pricey. It was off-putting since yes, the food tasted pretty good, but not enough for me to overlook the price especially with the small quantities. Conclusion: Honestly, I probably won't come back here. I've had way better experiences at other dimsum places. The only way, I'll probably come here is when I'm in the mood for a dose of chicken feet.	3star
This place was super cute and I would probably be a a regular if we lived in NY. Beautiful building and ambiance. The music was great and the drink the best one I've had out here!	5star
The ambience at Tabaré is gorgeous and the outdoor dining option in the back is cute and quaint. The food was OK. I didn't have a main but my dining partner thought her skirt steak was divine. All was going well until post-dinner/check payment. You see, Tabaré is cash only and since we had the exact change to cover the check - imagine that! - we summoned the waiter over to collect payment. We sat there a few minutes more - wrapping up - when, to our surprise, the waiter (or manager) walked over to notify us that our 'payment did not include a tip' and that we gave them 'the exact change for the bill.' Say what? Completely surprised and flummoxed, we managed to stammer a response: we are plannning to leave the tip ON the the table. We may draw conclusions on why she assumed we would not reward them for their service, but there are numerous restaurant in this great city at which to dine. Needless to say, I will not be returning.	2star
I simply can't figure out the high ratings of this place on Yelp.  Food and service were both mediocre and value is non-existent.  The pasta dishes we tried were the pappardelle with wild mushrooms and the spaghetti Limon. The pappardelle was overcooked and the dish was overloaded with butter, which is basically what you do when you can't create good flavor.  Thankfully, the wild mushroom saved the dish.  At $25, this was a total fail.  The spaghetti limon was not memorable. The pasta was cooked fine but it was dry and one note.  The risotto of the day came with pancetta and mushroom with a fried egg on top. It would have been nice to actually get a bite of the pancetta but it was infused into the risotto so all we got was the saltiness. The fried egg added nothing to the dish and they used too much butter in the risotto as well.   Last but not least, the fillet of branzino. Firstly, they don't tell you it's a fillet (our mistake, we should have asked). Secondly, it's the size of the Donald Trump's hands.  We had 4 bites and it was done.  Third, we found bones in it. I have no issues with fish bones but I do have issues with fish bones in a fillet. Clean that sh*t properly. On top of everything, they are cash only. Great, we just ate some overpriced, underwhelming food and I can't even get points on my credit card.  We are definitely not coming back. Why would we come here when we can walk into Lupa and get pasta dishes that are way better for under $20? I can't recommend it even if you are in the area.  For good Italian, you will get better value for your money if you take a cab to the other side of town.	2star
Sorry but I will not be eating here again. French toast. hated it!! no flavor. very bland. bacon was pretty dang good. My daughter didn't like it either. what kid hates French toast and syrup? well moving on... I also had the fried pork chop and eggs. and let me tell you I loved the eggs but that butterfly shaped fried pork chop had no flavor at all . I even put salt and pepper on it to give it a chance but I just didn't do any good. the salad that came with it had more flavor than the meat. lol I am not kidding. I was so very disappointed with this restaurant. 2 different breakfast dishes on the table and both were bad. come on ..... let me tell you  the host decided to give us a cinnamon bun treat on the house. it was served  in one of those small cast iron skillets with white frosting on top. and that was just ok. not sweet and delicious like Pillsbury cinnamon buns but whatcha gonna do.  So there you have it. I didn't  like the breakfast food. and will not be going back to check it out again.  maybe the evening chef is better. something to think about. sparkling wine was delicious. I will go back for that. Stay well and eat well bye my friends and later people.	2star
The various dishes we ordered for the table were pretty hit or miss. I usually love dumplings and can eat nothing but them for a meal, but they were dry and not very enjoyable here. The kalbi, japchae and kimchi fried rice were all very good. The place was packed but service was still pretty good.  My main complaint regarding this place is they clean the tables with some kind of bleach. It's particularly nasty when you're trying to enjoy your meal and a staff member is cleaning the table of the party who just left next to you. I also got a weak hint of a bleach smell while drinking the water served in their cups. I can appreciate they're trying to keep things clean, but they really need to do something about that because that smell can easily ruin a meal. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience, but I don't think it was one that has me excited to come back again anytime soon.	3star
I want to give this place a 5* rate because of its nice food. However, they have a fatal deficit at their service. We came on a Friday night and they had a classic mistake which is when we came, we have no server to ask about our orders for 10 minutes. Apart from its service, the food was good tho. Spicy pork hotstone bowl was my favorite. The spicy pork has a little sweet taste in it which naturalize te spicy tastes. In addition, crispy chicken buns and crunchy tofu are also worth trying.  Anyway, this place is a nice place to visit for late night dinner.	4star
I'll be honest, I wanted to go eat next door. That's where everyone recomended I go. However their over was closed, and it was raining, so I found myself next door. It turns out that was a great choice because of the history of Juliana's, and I was getting close to the same product, some may even argue better. I can't compare, but I can tell you that Juliana's pie is absolutely amazing. One of my favorite pizzas I have ever eaten, and I have eaten a ton of pizza. A+	5star
I told my boyfriend that the udon here was great so he had to try it. He got the chikara udon (chicken, mochi, negi) and I got the kamonan udon (duck, negi).  The duck meat was OK. Not overcooked, but I like eating my duck with the skin still attached. The broth that came with the kamonan udon was way too fishy tasting. I didn't like it. The chicken in my boyfriend's udon was pretty plain. Both the duck and chicken were not seasoned or anything, just boiled I think. Duck meat has a distinctive taste and texture so that was fine, but the chicken was very bland. The mochi was also not what I expected. I'm used to the rice balls that comes in chinese cuisine, which are rolled into neat little spheres. The mochi that came in the udon was just a roll of mochi that was kind of gooey and sticky everywhere. Taste wise, it was fine, but aesthetically, I feel like they could have done better. The udon noodles themselves were still great, and my boyfriend, the udon lover, agrees. However, that's really about it. The meat/vegetables that come with the udon were not bad, but not great. The broth is hit or miss.	3star
Food here is pretty mediocre and not that cheap. This is a sub-3-star review but to be fair, it's still a good spot for lunch if you're busy, don't want delivery, or can't get out of FiDi. The ingredients for the noodles, stir fry etc are pretty basic and the food ends up lathered in sauce, especially if you get the ready-made stuff at the counter. I'd compare my satisfaction to going to an average food truck near my office. Those are at least cheaper.	2star
We were looking for some good Colombian Food. I Googled it and I saw the Good reviews in Yelp and Good and we decided to go there On Friday January 22, 2016. For our surprise it was not as we expected. We ordered a Bandeja Paisa nothing compare to what I had before in other Colombian Restaurants. That's the worse money ever spent. Their portion are small and overpriced. We took our food to go and it was such a disappointment that if we were checked it there we would just return it.	1star
I didn't really expect this place to be this good. Coming from someone who loves Tex mex food, I was shocked by how much I enjoyed my chicken quesadilla (which had very little cheese btw). The meat is seasoned very well I wish it wasn't so small I ate it way too fast. Getting on the line is definitely worth it. Will I be back? Hell yeah. Already came back for another one.	4star
Had lunch at Queens Bully. The venue is very nice and inviting.  Loved how much light comes into the place from the windows and glass doors.  I ordered the half chicken and it comes with coleslaw, corn bread and french fries.  The chicken was perfectly cooked but I wasn't impressed with the rub but I think it's my personal preference and taste.  I would love to see smaller options for lunch on the menu and well as more salads.  While $16.00 for half a chicken and all the sides the order comes with is not a lot, for lunch it's bit much in my opinion.  The service was good and the waiter and bus boy were attentive. All in all I liked the place and will come back, possibly for happy hour since I work in the neighborhood.	4star
I stopped by upon discovering this place on yelp - good thing I did cause it definitely did not disappoint! It functions sort of like a fast food restaurant, which is great because it's also near NYU where students can conveniently stop by to munch. You basically order your food and then pick a seat to wait until your order is ready. The whole process took less than 20 minutes even when the lines were relatively long (and only 10 minutes to eat cause it was too yummy).  I ordered the braised beef noodle soup and regular pork dumplings. I must say, both the noodle soup and pork dumplings were delicious especially eaten on a chilly winter day to warm you up. The soup was tasty that I drank a lot of it! It made me quite thirsty afterwards though, so it probably consisted a lot of msg. As for the dumplings, they were very juicy! You know dumplings are going to be good when you take a bite and a lot of soup squirts out! The skin was neither thick nor thin, somewhere in between. Overall, it was a pretty satisfying experience! Great place to grab some quick food!!	4star
Went here tonight for my GF birthday solely based on the reviews I read. To be honest the restaurants I passed up to come to Olio was a mistake. First the waiter was kind of non personality having so his vibe alone was a bad start for us. We got things rolling with a couple of appetizers and a salad that was saltier than the Dead Sea ...who wants a salty salad? Not me buddy!  Want to make this quick the rest of the food was pretty good but, I won't go out of my way to eat here...City Cake and Empire saved the night for us.	2star
We celebrated my sister's birthday here. Thanks to my yelp friend Kevin C. for telling me that the best way to reserved a table here is to go there than calling them. I tried calling them a lot of times & didn't get any answer. So I went there 2 weekd before my sister's birthday & got a reservation for 8:45pm. Very easy!  We got there 10mins before the reservation time & good thing they have their own parking lot. We walked in & got seated right away. Our server was really nice. He let us take our time to decide.  Food:  2 pieces thick cut bacon- omg! The best bacon ever. Me & my bf loves it. Its juicy & tender. I can eat this without anything. Yum! Steak for 3- theirs 3 of us & we thought its gonna be enough. Enough in the sense that we will finished everything but were wrong. The steak for 3 can be shared for 4 to 5 people especially if you get side dish. Its really big. We didn't even finished it & bring some home. Its juicy, perfectly medium well cooked. The sauce adds up more flavor. Creamed spinach- very good! Creamy & tasty. Taste well with the steak.  Onion rings- not really into onion rings. I tried a piece since my bf loves it. Its sweet & crispy.  It was a great dinner. We enjoyed the food. My sister was happy. We got hot fudge sundae for dessert to share & they sang happy birthday to her.	4star
Terrible hostess, makes a party of 2 wait for no reason and seats 2 other groups that came after	1star
Came here last night with friends.  Make sure your whole party is with you because they won't seat you unless they are all present. It was a 30 minute wait at first as well for a table for 3. The atmosphere is nice and the space is cozy. My friends and I sat at the round table up front so compared to the back o think we had more room. It's good for a part of 1 too, there are bar seats. We ordered a bottle of Chardonnay. Don't get it. It was bad. I forgot what the brand was but it was a twist top.  For appetizers we got the vegetable spring rolls and the beef buns. The spring rolls lacked flavor unfortunately but the buns were pretty good. Def add the sauce they have on the side though. It's a tiny bit dry without it. As for the main dish, I got the Pad See Moa with chicken (with medium spice). It was delish!!! The medium spice was perfect for me and for this dish. My friend got the pad Thai with medium spice but his didn't have the same amount kick that I had (close to none actually). So...yeah...but my dish was great!haha.  The service was amazing though!!!! Everyone was super nice and attentive. There was one guy who was extra friendly and made sure our food was good and we were enjoying our dinner.  1 bottle of wine, 2 apps, 3 main dishes came out to be around $94 (excluding tip).  Overall: 3.5 :)  I would want to try the noodle soups next time!	4star
If you want to come here for bottomless brunch they are awful. They were so unaccommodating and hardly ever refilled our drinks. DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU WANT BOTTOMLESS.	1star
"walked in and was greeted, as one should be. My co worker was going to order a chicken taco, the girl suggested a steak one, thanks for the suggestion. During the transaction, I picked up a flyer/postcard kind of thing that on the bottom of it in fine print it said 10% off with the next order with the flyer. So I told the girl while showing her, but she looked lost and hesitated said she would ask and didn't try so she proceeded charged my coworker anyhow and said next purchase we could use it, cool.  As we're waiting she offers us water we said no thanks. So my co worker orders a guac and sour cream, the girl says it's a side order which also, cool. But my co worker asked about the 10% off for that with the flyer since it was an extra $4 for the sides.  The girl once again looks clueless and actually asks but the manager on the clock and told her no that was for November(we're a week away from March )so I kindly told her she should take it off the counter if they won't honor is and she said ""well usually people take them to remember the place they don't really look at that""...not cool.  We get back to work and the guac is literally smashed avocados with CHUNKS of red onion, this isn't chipotle. Guac wasn't all that much served or taste worthy for 2 bucks if you ask me."	2star
I've been to so many restaurants during my visit in NYC. And I must have to say that Joe's Shanghai was THE best - cheap yet extremely delicious!! The restaurant is tucked inside Chinatown, so it was quite difficult to find it. I enjoyed sight seeing the many things in Chinatown on the way to the restaurant though. I've heard so many good reviews about this restaurant; hence, I thought there was going to be a long wait. But my boyfriend and I literally got a table within few seconds after we arrived! As soon as we got seated, we were given hot tea (no extra charge!). We ordered xiao long bao (pork soup dumplings), braised beef noodle soup, and a scallion pancake for appetizers. I thought the scallion pancake was too oily. But oh my goodness - the soup dumplings are so freaking delicious! They're better than the ones from Din Tai Fung! If only I wasn't full, I would've ordered another dish of the soup dumplings. My boyfriend enjoyed the braised beef noddle soup as well. Meat were tender and juicy. The broth was perfectly made - not too salty. Restaurant seems pretty fast-paced and loud. But that was what made my experience better here. Seating is limited, so I would suggest you to visit here with only one person. Try to avoid coming in with a group here unless you don't mind waiting for a long time. When we got out of the restaurant, we noticed a long line for this restaurant. I guess we came pretty early (around 11am) and were lucky enough to get a table right away. All in all, Joe's Shanghai is definitely a must if you are in NYC. The thousands of Yelp reviews explain how popular this restaurant is. It deserves a 5 star!	5star

I really like this place. The drinks are strong and inexpensive. They have a really vast menu. I was with a party of 11 people so we spilt the alligator bites, calamari and hush puppies. All very good. I ordered the grilled oysters and the crab bucket with garlic Sauce and corn. Really Good! The only complaint I have is that it was so so so hot inside. Not sure if the ac was working or not but that's my only complaint.	4star
"Before our departure back to ATL, our food squad had one last spot to cross off our NYC food adventures, Nom Wah Tea Parlor. We gave the restaurant a try on Dec. 11, 2016. We joined the masses as we all waited outside for a table for 45 minutes. Once the estimated time was up we were finally able to get seated.  Inside was crowded and the ambiance was baddd... (not bad as in bad but bad meaning good). The tiles on the floor, pictures hanging against the wall, and the coat hangers reminded me of how older Hong Kong tea parlors actually look like (AWESOME). We were starving after 45 minute of wait time, so we wasted no time and started marking our choices: -Ha-Gow (Shrimp Dumpling) -Siu-Mai (Pork and Shrimp) -Phong-Jow (Chicken Feet) - The only item that was pretty good -Ha-Churn-Fun (Shrimp Crepe) -OG Eggroll  -Stuff Eggplant (Eggplant was fresh, but hoped for more flavor inside the filling) -Spare Rib with Black Bean Sauce All the items came out hot and fresh which was the only positives of what I experienced. The dim-sum here was okay, nothing really in regards to taste that stood out to me. I would say the taste is borderline average. As for the service, not the friendliest and professional of the bunch. We didn't even get our tea until the end of the meal (kind of defeats the purpose of yum-cha or dim-sum). Our table was next to the server's work station. We can over-hear the servers cursing and complaining about a customer in Chinese as a table returned a dish with a hair in it.  We expected a very awesome experience as this joint was established in 1920, however it was all hype and overrated. It hurts me so bad to give this place a 2-star review but I have to keep it real for real dim-sum heads. I felt like the restaurant is living off of ""the oldest tea parlor in NYC"" name just to trap tourist / dim-sum virgins and perhaps a reason to over-price their items."	2star
The food was really good, I went for breakfast with my family. However, they were not gluten or dairy free. The service was okay, and it was a bit pricey.	3star
Small, overpriced portions and a somehow limited menu. The place is nice and quiet though and the food is tasty; 3 stars! Ps: I'm from northern Italy so I had plenty of polenta, porchetta, pecorino, tomato sauces, panini and pesto in my life. Maybe that's why I'm not as impressed as the other yelpers	3star
"I've heard so many people simply rave about Pig Beach over the summer - I was greatly disappointed that it did not live up to the expectations ... the location is great, the set up is nice, and on a good-weather day, it's a nice place to relax with a couple of beers; however, ""the couple of beers"" part depends on what day it is as the selection changes (and the day we visited, it wasn't all that great for our taste buds) and more importantly, the food - definitely fell short.  We tried a variety of things - ribs, pork, and sliders; the meat was just too dry - granted, it was end of the day Sunday but .. well, just disappointing ... and due to the inconsistency of how ""well"" the sliders were prepared, the staff (who by the way are super nice, helpful, and friendly!) were kind enough to offer us an alternative and so we also tried the turkey and tri tip.  The turkey (shockingly) was the only thing that wasn't completely dry and actually tasted nice.  Perhaps there may be an update to this in the future - while I won't be rushing back, I would consider a second chance as some point."	3star
I visited this restaurant on a Saturday with a friend recently based on the recommendation of a fellow elite yelper. First off this spot is not easy to get to and very hidden. But the views from this restaurant are worth the trip/search. It can get very crowded as it gets later on the evening and musicians played throughout the night. This is a bar setting but I observed quite a few small children with their families.  The menu mainly consists of various types of sausages. I tried the kielbasa and my friend had the chorizo which were both very good. The sides consisted of pita bread as well as onions with the chorizo and sauerkraut with the keilbasa. Each plate of sausage cost us $10.00 which I think is alot for just plain grilled meat with out even a side salad. Everything is served fast food style where you place your order at one counter and pick it at another once your number is called.  There is NO table service of any kind that I observed during my visit and purchases are cash only. There is an ATM on site but the fee is $3.00 so come prepared with cash.	3star
Perfect pick. Got lucky cause we wanted ramen on a rainy chilly day. At noon on a Monday the place was packed but ordering and food was quick. Like 10 minutes total and magically two spots to sit opened up. In and out crowd. And the ramen and hand spicy tuna roll... perfect	5star
First time to Thai Villa. Was busy but they gave us a table in 5 minutes... next time I'll make a reservation. Friendly and ultra attentive but not intrusive service. The decor was warm, exotic and magically delightful. Highly recommend. Pad See Ew was excellent.	5star
Thanks for the replying. As for the soup Yan du xian (腌笃鲜) , if u did use cured ham, the soup would have the flavor of Yan . But I tasted none in my soup. Since you removed the cured ham, I had no clue about how well the ham is cured. Based on the taste of the soup, I have my question mark on that. For the fried prawns(油爆虾), the whole frying process should be as short as possible. The shells become crispy and separate from the prawns when frying in the oil. The whole process happens under one minute. That's why the size of prawn matters a lot. When you use large prawns, you have to cut the shell open before frying in order to get flavor in. The dish is nothing like any fried prawns(油爆虾)I had in my hometown. When you name a dish 油爆虾, people who know Shanghai cuisine will have certain expectations. While I understand the dish is limited by the material supply, you can either inform customer you use different materials or change you dish name to something else like fried prawns in *** sauce.(葱爆大虾/红烧大虾） I add one star because the owner takes the time to listen and explain.	2star
I do see the appeal. The place is cute, no doubt about it. Service is amicable and attentive. The whole concept is spot-on which accounts for the long lines at times. But the food is uninspired and sorta below average to be honest. Not much I can add to that. It's not a place we would go to again.	2star
Awesome service and a nice restaurant decor that feels like a Parisian cafe. We had brunch here and we're pleased to find a decent brunch menu without a crowd waiting to be seated.  With the following this place has, I'm shocked that we were seated immediately, but the torrential downpour might have helped with that.  The food highlight was the goat cheese ball - it was surprisingly delicious! The traditional eggs benedict held its own, but I've had better. The English Muffin was disappointing. Nevertheless, the presentation was excellent and price was exactly what it should have been. I might try one of their eggs benedict variations when I return.	4star
Went here for a business lunch on 12/23/2016 with a few colleagues. Food: had the burrata appetizer and pasta with squash and sausage ragout.  Overall, good quality food; burrata was fresh and well made, nice accompanying fig relish, entree had fresh pasta, nice ingredients in the sauce, but perhaps a bit over priced (although maybe not for this neighborhood). Service: attentive and polite - no complaints Space: Well decorated, however noticed what appeared to be mold stains above the bar, which was actually quite distracting during the meal.  Especially considering the image that Da Claudio is striving for, they should really address whatever issue is causing the unsightliness above the bar area. Overall: would come back here again, solid Italian and a little off the beaten path from the Brookfield chains.	3star
Oh how I miss you already. Please please please let us know where you are opening next. Best stand alone dumpling in NYC. No joke. And what a deal!!	5star
Excellent food and a friendly atmosphere. Four of us shared some appetizer plates of grilled octopus, fried stuffed zucchini flowers and a mixed cold antipasto platter. Everything was great although the zucchini flowers and the grilled octopus plates were small portions; not really meant for sharing more than 2 people. Pasta dishes were all delicious. My linguine with tomato sauce, grape tomatoes, mussels, clams, shrimp and squid was just like my mom would make. The spaghetti with arugula and avocado pesto & shrimp was very garlicky and tasty. We didn't have any main courses. The desserts (tiramisu', panna cotta and affogato gelato with espresso) were really good too. A bottle, actually two, of Prosecco wine completed a fine meal. The atmosphere is fun and lively. The wood tables and benches are interesting as long as you're not sitting on those benches too long. They are a bit hard and uncomfortable to sit at for a long time. I would return here for dinner or possibly a nice weekend brunch to take in the nearby views on the water.	4star
"I've been here several times but my most recent trip will for sure be my last. It was a nightmare from beginning to end.  To start, we were seated next to the bus station when there were several other tables available. When we gently asked to switch, we were greeted with a sigh and an eyeroll from the hostess, who could not have been older than 18. I'm not sure what training she's had, but it's absolutely unacceptable to roll your eyes and sigh in the face of a customer, especially when their request is one as simple and polite as ours was.  After moving, we had to have waited 45 minutes for our food, which wouldn't have been that bad if the events immediately following hadn't occurred. (by the way- the food really isn't great but you're paying for the beautiful location. There are literally thousands of better restaurants in Manhattan but none can beat this location). The first problem that we encountered after our food arrived was that my mom, who was wearing a black dress, was given a white napkin and it had left residue on her dress. We asked for a black napkin, which is customary for guests wearing black attire, and our waiter told us he would get the manager. Too bad the manager was busy flirting with a woman at the next table over and hadn't moved for about 20 minutes. I don't really care about what the manager does with his love life, but it might be a good idea for him to attend to patrons' needs instead of flirting with a random woman while her children sit next to her.  Once the manager finally came over- which had to have taken at least another 15 minutes- we'd finished eating. Regardless, he told my mom she must be imagining the white residue on her dress (which was clearly visible) because they ""paid for this not to happen"" with the white napkins. I'm not sure what that means, but it's rude to accuse a customer of making something up and tell them that they're wrong instead of just apologizing. I know that these problems are minuscule, but the entire experience was ruined by the way the staff at the Boathouse treated us. It's clearly a tourist trap, but don't treat your customers like trash just because you know they won't return."	1star
A laid-back chic space conveniently located in the heart of Chelsea. The roominess is a welcome change from the normal elbow to elbow seating at other establishments in the area. Service is friendly and prompt. Went for brunch the other day. Coffee was good. Do not skip the beignets! They are completely amazing. I had the oven baked sunny side up eggs with bacon and cinnamon raisin toast. It was okay but nothing spectacular. The bacon was very well cooked though so I'd definitely get a side. My friend was happy with their fried egg sandwich.  Overall, it's a little overpriced for what you're getting but what you get is pretty good. Will be back!	4star
Saw the good reviews so I figured I'd try this place. We ordered for pickup, preparation and pick up was fast and easy. However, when I got home I was super disappointed. I ordered the mussels as my appetizer, about $9, and was so disappointed to find only about 6 actual mussels in it. Also got the tom yum soup (had a lot of mushrooms which was good) but not even filled to the top. What a ripoff. The drunken noodle and pad Thai were okay but never coming again. Again, a rip off.	1star
Very cute little spot with a great backyard. Drinks are good. I would have liked to have tried their deserts but when I went there at 10:20pm on Sunday they had already had last call. Which I thought was a bit early if they closed at 11pm. Also this was President's day weekend so I thought they might be open a bit later. I would recommend to go here but make sure to go on the early side on Sunday.	3star
Came here to do some work and use the wifi.  The iced coffee I ordered was good. The chairs were uncomfortable for prolonged use and the wifi wasn't working. When I asked our waitress about it she said there were too many people using it...there were probably 10 laptops there. We used the wifi for the coffee shop next door and it worked fine.	2star
TLDR you really can't go wrong with anything here. - Tonkatau, great. - Tokyo, great. - *special that is apparently frequently on the menu* Duck ramen, great. - Tsukemen, great The lunch special is a great value.	4star
I don't think this place is ready to open until they have their servers trained, workflow fixed, and construction finished.  Guess you are right, birds of different feathers don't stick together. I will not be back. In response to the comment below: 1. No idea what to do after entering the restaurant, wasn't greeted, and no instructions on ordering etc. 2. Today, Just a few hours ago. Ladder was still up.	1star
I would like to start off with the fact that the food is pretty good here. Only problem is you get very little of it and it's extremely overpriced for the portions. Be prepared to leave hungry! I went here with my boyfriend and a group of friends last night and ordered the carrots, the heirloom tomato salad and the pasta with goat cheese, sans the lamb as I don't heat meat. Everything was TINY. 5 carrots, literally. Even coming out on the ceramic plate with all the garnish, it looked pathetically small. The portion of the pasta was laughably small. It would have been sufficient for a 2 year old. I am not exaggerating. Not to mention that when we received our bill, they charged us full price for the pasta even though it was not smothered in lamb! I think that is highway robbery and plainly unfair. When my boyfriend asked the waiter about that, he stated, in a not particularly nice way that they don't lower the price. Was not gracious or even slightly accomodating. I will not be going back.	2star
Went here for a pre-Barclay dinner. It was a very relaxed atmosphere with communal seating. We order some drinks (margarita and pina colada- both good margarita was on the sweet side) tacos and some Mexican corn. The corn was on point! It will bring be back for sure. Overall it's a great spot if you want to be low key and not afraid to mingle with strangers.	4star
such a nice day. I wasn't expecting to spend 3 1/2hours in a restaurant waiting for food and mimosas. I saw people just walking out. They literally have you waiting forever. When I got there, they didn't even put the pitcher on the table. We had no food or drinks. Worst customer service. I'm not one to complain but I'd probably never recommend this place to anyone. People were going to other tables asking if they got served yet. It was terrible.'you need to hire more staff. I had other waiter telling wait for your waiter. I paid 100!for terrible service. Stuck it it out because my friend felt bad that everyone left.  This place is horrible.	1star
One of the better establishments in sunnyside, restaurants here are mostly disappointing. Limited seating so may have to be lucky or come early and beat the crowds.  Pretty decent selection of beers with some options from various Queens brewers. Supporting local is always a welcomed move. Mojitos are average, I can do without.  Standout would definitely be the food here. Cheese platter with select cheeses from Stinky Brooklyn. The honeyed raisins that came with the cheeses were amazing. Colombian board came with a sausage that wasn't disgustingly salty! Guacamole was a rough cut, still got chunks of avocado (personal preference thing here, but I do prefer a rougher cut than a total puree). Fries was the only average appetizer we ordered. Standard fries with some cheese and bacon, nothing stood out.  The best app we had was the steak lollipop, basically skewered steak slices. Grilled excellently, topped with greens and onions and not sauced aggressively, blah blah blah delicious etc. What made it stand out was the cherry tomatoes, odd to say, but try it.	5star
While I love the interior and the concept, the food really didn't stand out. The portions were fairly small and flavors were weak. Expect a wait during weekend brunch hours.	3star
One of the greatest restaurant disappointments. I always wanted to go to Slanted Door in SF. I didn't want to believe the review here that said to save your $$ and spend it at one of the usual good, cheap Vietnamese restaurants.  That Yelper was right on. Very nice back patio and service was fine, place was empty 5:30 on an August Saturday.  That's where the good ends.   Maybe the real chef went on vacation? Papaya salad looked incredible but was the worst I've ever had.  ZERO flavor.  I have no idea how this could have turned out so tasteless.  It was like making yourself eat raw, tasteless white radishes.  $20 chicken claypot- I've had much better for half the price.  Chicken quality needed to be better- more tender.  Sauce had next to no flavor.    Only got some flavor with the one sprig of cilantro.    You get rice if you ask for it and it is a half filled bowl and blah.  Grilled lemongrass pork chops- looked incredible.  Large portion but served with way too much arugula.   Pork was DRY, chewy and FLAVORLESS. Sorry for the caps but at $27.00 for this dish, it really is wrong that you are charged triple the price of so many other Viet. places where you could have delicious, tender pork with real lemongrass flavor. Chocolate lava cake with blue cheese--- interesting/different - was decent.  Have had much better lava cakes.  I could melt a little blue cheese in the center of a Trader Joe lava cake and it would taste the same.  100 bucks later (with tip and one beer)-  I completely give up on over-hyped Park Slope area restaurants	1star
This is a really cute brunch spot on a nice day. The wait wasn't extremely long, which works since they do not take reservations. They provide unlimited mimosa, Bloody Mary or Beer brunch. Definitely worth it. The serving sizes for the drinks are HUGE. I was only able to finish two mimosas.  I had the French toast with banana foster which was ok. It wasn't quite banana foster, as much as it was slices of bananas inside of maple syrup. My friends had the jambalaya and the crab egg Benedict, those were definitely a must try.  Definitely not my first boozy brunch option, but worth a shot.	3star
Ehhh. It's all about the atmosphere. Food was nothing special & over priced. I ordered the eggplant sandwich-I do not recommend. My Friend said her onion soup was ok but over priced. I recommend ordering a drink or glass of wine if you really want to have the experience of eating here without having to pay for the mediocre over priced food. I also had the smallest most expensive latte ever here. Service, however, was fabulous.	2star
"2 stars for the food, 1 for the service. You gotta jump through hoops to get the free appetizer.  We showed the waitress the promo and she said they don't honor it. So after we ordered, I went up to the counter and asked another lady and she told me you must have a $20 minimum (which isn't stated on yelp). But after she looked at our order, she said, ""fine ok choose an appetizer"".  I almost thought they'd charge for it in the end anyway but luckily they didn't."	1star
Nice place with great food quality and taste. We like this place for weekends.	4star
I went here for a friend's birthday and the restaurant was very accommodating of our large group. The decor was nice with dark wood and a full bar. Service was quick, with a casual friendliness that felt very genuine. My section of the group ordered the Sengalese spring rolls to start and these were great. They had a surprising heat to them and we wound up ordering another round. I ordered a beer cocktail that was basically a Corona mixed with a spicy, Old Bay like concoction. I would not recommend this drink, it just wasn't my bag. For my entree I had the Branzino with couscous. It came with plantains and onions. All in all it was a nice dish, but it didn't blow me away. I was a little let down since the appetizers had been so good. I would give this place another try because my companions all really enjoyed their food and overall it was a very nice dining experience. It is a smaller place so I would definitely recommend calling ahead if you have a large party. Otherwise people seemed to just walk up and be seated on a Saturday evening.	3star
A landmark establishment that stands the test of time due to great service, good cocktails, and terrific food in a great atmosphere.	5star
I tried the chicken biscuit it was decent but nothing to write home about. I also tried the fried chicken which although it was crispy it was lacking flavor. I honestly don't get what the rave is all about. One thing I will say is that the banana cream pie is really good. I don't see myself returning again the food really was nothing special.	3star
I don't get it? The food was very underwhelming.... and we tried a lot. The lobster Mac and cheese?? I was so excited to try this, it was just okay. The scallops appetizer? Just okay. Tuna special of the day wasn't fresh. Crab cake was a good sized portion but tasted off. Alaskan king crabs were great- but what preparation does that really take? Branzino tasted off too. The food quality did not stand up to the establishment. A lot of meh with the food. However, service was fantastic and the desserts very phenomenal. We tried the molten cake, the key lime pie, and creme brûlée and pecan pie- yea fat I know but considering I'm not into sweets these were the highlight of the meal. Would I return? Not on my own dime....	2star
"I WISH YELP HAD NEGATIVE STARS.  I was at Claw Daddy's for the Claw Fest promotion and I'm extremely upset about the advertisement of this promotional deal. I was super excited to go to claw fest and planned to go back 3 more times (with different groups of friends). The reason I'm upset is that the advertisement is very misleading. Even though it doesn't say that the $30 or $35 price (as the one on your page advertises) is all you can eat, I had mistakenly thought it was. A bunch of my friends also thought the same way and they were very surprised when I showed them the final bill at the end. Looking at the advertisement after, I see that you did not write that its all you can eat. But you also didn't state that it wasn't and didn't specify how much you get. The blurb that the price doesn't include taxes or gratuity is again misleading. There is also a ""2 hour time limit"" which made me believe it was AYCE.  I'm also upset because my friends and I waited about 2.5 hours for the table and we were hanging out at the bar (talking with the owner) and it never came up. I don't plan on returning to Claw Daddy's for the claw fest and to be honest I don't think I will be returning to Claw Daddy's in general (at least not for a while). The food is good and the claw daddy sauce is delicious I'm just extremely upset about what happened and I wanted to let my fellow Yelpers know to prevent future disappointed customers."	1star
Great place! Owner is very personable.  Haven't had the food yet but def will be back to try it out.  Solid Happy Hour Specials that run all night! Nice looking spot and they should be opening the first floor soon.	5star
Was looking forward to more a FUSION FUSION kinda restaurant but a lot of it was simple Chinese dishes. Kinda sad I had to pay almost 3x for these dishes that I would've paid much less for in Chinatown.  We had the dungeonness fried rice. I didn't taste any of the crab nor where there really any crab chunks. And I thought it lacked in salt and pepper.  Lobster egg rolls. Large. But most of it is veggies. Eh.  We liked the oxtail dumplings 10/10. Get that !!!! But only comes in 4 small dumplings. I'd still get that again though.  Overall great place for ambience and if you wanna impress your date with the classiness of it. But pricey for Chinese food	3star
First time visiting this part of Brooklyn and obviously, first time at Buttermilk Channel. My cousin and I went for brunch on Saturday around 10:30am and the place was already filled up (inside and outside), but luckily, we snagged a couple seats at the bar and were ready to chow down. I decided to go with the short rib hash; my cousin chose the mushroom scramble; we shared the buttermilk pancakes. The short rib hash with sunnyside eggs on top was delish and whatever they put on their mixed green side salad was so good and a perfect add to the whole dish. I didn't try my cousin's scramble, but she loved it and ate up the whole plate. The pancakes were HUGE to say the least. They were both heavy yet fluffy at the same time with a nice crisp on the outside and super soft on the inside. Overall, we were both extremely satisfied with our meal and left feeling happy and full. Coffee was pretty good, too! A little bit on the expensive side, but it's brunch, so whatevs. Definitely wouldn't mind returning if I ever decide to venture out to Brooklyn again!	4star
Walk in here on the weekend for brunch and it's literally a mad house. The entrance/front area to get to the hostess stand is the biggest disaster I've ever witnessed in a restaurant - a mob of people, loud, disorganized, no one knows where to stand. Once you get passed that point, it's a lovely experience here at Cookshop. The chaotic crowd is misleading, the wait is not as bad as it looks. Reservations are easy to get as well. The restaurant is fairly large AND they have outdoor seating! I didn't get a great look around the inside because thankfully we were seated outside. The set up is excellent and the service is attentive and kind. The food is delicious, fresh, and seasonal! Options changes daily....there's even a date at the top of the menu. That being said, the prices are definitely up there. There are a lot of great apps and things to start off with. We got biscuits and jam. Fluffy and warm. I had the flawlessly poached eggs and my friend had the breakfast bowl, both were perfectly made and tasted fresh and light, yet satisfyingly filling. The drink menu matches the food menu in that it is creative, thorough, and pricey. I would recommend! Definitely make a reservation to make the hectic entrance a little less hectic.	4star
Nice restaurant on St. Marks with a good concept and plenty of seating. The service, however, leaves something to be desired. I came around 8 PM with a friend after a long workday and was seated instantly. Took about 20 minutes for our server to take our order, and nearly an hour for the food to come out. I got the Greek salad with chicken, which was delicious (the feta was unreal). An extra $5 for 4 tiny pieces of chicken was a bit unnecessary though. My friend got the ratatouille and thought it was tasty, though not quite worth the $20 price tag. All in all, a decent visit and cool place. Not in any rush to come back (nor are they in any rush to serve their customers).	3star
Yummy Mexican food in LIC! You really can't go wrong here. The food is delicious, and I would say slightly elevated for Mexican, which makes sense. It is a Michelin starred restaurant.  It is more of a casual setting-- nice, simple interior. Service has always been pretty good when I was there and prices are reasonable. They do get very busy, so expect a wait if you don't have a reservation, or come during off hours.  It's a good spot for drinks with friends, or even date night. I won't say it's my favorite Mexican in the city (That's up in Spanish Harlem), but definitely the best in this area for sure!	4star
"My review is solely based on the short exchange with one of the waiters which caused me to walk out and find another place to eat.  My husband and I came to Set, very hungry, after being recommended to come here by a friend. We were convinced by pictures we saw on Instagram and was looking forward to having dinner here. We walked in with our 6 month old daughter, a little after 6, still sunlight outside, bar completely empty.  A waiter greeted us then a waitress told us to sit wherever we liked. As we started to go toward a table a third waiter asked us how long we planned on staying, to which my husband answered, however long it takes us to eat. The waiter responds with, ""Just saying, because you know it's a bar""  I immediately got turned off, once again, it was a little after 6, on a Thursday, still broad daylight outside, and the bar was empty save for two other parties.  I have enough common sense to: 1) not go into a bar with a baby that was packed 2) not go into a bar past a certain time 3) sit in a bar with my infant and drink.  We were there solely for food. I've been in other bars, eaten and left.  Questioning us on how long we'll take felt like we were being rushed to get out even before we'd taken a seat and it didn't make me feel welcomed. I refused to subject myself to feeling that way so therefore, we left."	1star
Buddakan is one of my favourite places of all time. If my friends and I are in the mood to share and splurge a bit, this is our go-to for great Asian-Fusion that doesn't completely break the bank. Unless of course you go with a certain friend for his Emperor-themed birthday who insists on ordering everything on the menu. I think the shrimp toast, edamame dumplings, oxtail dumplings, pork belly buns, duck fried rice, and the lamb are absolute must-haves. However, I have had almost everything on the menu and nothing has disappointed thus far.  It's always nice to peruse the Chelsea Market, which is directly next door, after dinner as well.	5star
We saw this place had a 4.5 and we were going into Chinatown and Soho. It was a trek from the subway but it was all worth it. The owner who was our waitress helped us with our first experience selecting. Wow!  We were not disappointed. Everything was fresh and delicious. This a spot I would recommend.	5star
I went here with a friend to grab a bite to eat on a weeknight. The place was pretty packed so it was a good thing that we had a reservation and were able to be seated right away. To start with, we went with an order of the guacamole. The guacamole was very average and even bordered on the side of not good--just bland and lacking a lot of flavor. For my meal, I decided to go with the cod dish--though it appeared to be cooked decently, it had a bit of fishiness to it that I was not expecting and sort of tainted the whole dish for me. Overall, this place is very loud, very expensive, very crowded and was very underwhelming food-wise--definitely not on my list of places to return.	2star
I was so so excited to dine here. I'm a life long New Yorker who has eaten at the most expensive to the cheapest restaurants. I just love great food and wait staff who are excited to serve the food. I had such expectations and none was meant here. I'm not sure why I've never eaten at Union Square Cafe in its old location but I made it a point to eat at this new location. I'm not sure why it's so hard to get an online reservation when I saw empty tables at my 6:00pm reservation.  First, my bf and I ordered a dozen oysters, which was just ok. Would not order it again. Go to grand central oyster bar or mermaid inn for that. Then we ordered the polenta and the honeynut  squash. Both good. I really liked the polenta which was the best thing about my enter dinner. For our entree I ordered the tagliatelle pasta, which was just ok. Nothing great. My bf had the swordfish which he was excited to eat. But it was so so so salty. We mentioned it to our waitress who said it may be the capers. Maybe it was the capers but it was too salty either way. We expected something really yummy for a $41 piece of fish. Disappointing.  Our waitress was nice enough to offer another piece of swordfish but we thought it would take too long to get to us. So we declined the offer. Overall, the food was just ok. Nothing great.  Now for the service. Our waitress was friendly but we found ourselves looking for her more than a few times. I ordered a certain beer which took too long to get and it was the wrong beer. I was trying to find out waitress who was nowhere to be found. Eventually she got me my right beer. The period of time between our oysters, apps and entree was too long.  I thought Union Square Cafe is known for its service and I found it to be lackluster. I will NOT go back. I'm so very disappointed. I want it to be great. I paid almost $200 for an uninspired food and just ok service. I'm sad. Too bad.	2star
I love fried chicken. PnT has great fried chicken. More often then not, the wait is long...I'm not a waiting in line kinda gal..but that being said, I really loved their chicken.  The collards were great...the mashed potatoes were super watery and disappointing. Maybe because it was takeout? Either way, the apple pie made me forget all about the potatoes.	4star
Last Friday evening, I was looking for a new place to try pizza in my neighborhood. I decided on this restaurant as I had never been. Upon arrival with a reservation, the very nice hostess attempted to seat me at a bar table near the front door. This option was unacceptable to me and I requested a table in the main dining room. The hostess informed me that one was not available and that it would be a 25 minute wait for another table. As my guest and I turned to leave, a table miraculously became available in the main dining room. Surprise, surprise. I really hate when restaurants play games with their seating.  In terms of the food, we shared a plate of the calamari, which was simply OK, but not great. We also split one of the pizzas which again was not bad, but not memorable either.  The bottle of red with the meal was acceptable.  In terms of the service, the timing was a tad off.  Since the overall experience was marginal at best, I left a little bit under 15% as my tip. The main reason that I am writing this review is that either the server or the manager added extra tip to my bill, bringing the total tip to 20%. I discovered this when I checked my AMEX statement online today. I immediately telephoned AMEX and was provided with a credit for the overcharge. In all honesty, the amount of additional overcharge was not significant. However, it is the principle. There is no way that this was an accident. I am writing this review to warn other patrons to be careful when dining at this restaurant. This type of behavior is totally unacceptable for a neighborhood establishment. People.....watch your credit card statements.  You've Been Warned!	2star
Pretty good. I think this is an ideal place for drinks and bun-snacks. IDK if I'd recommend going for dinner. Cool spot to hang though!	3star
Was around the area and decided to check it out! My friend actually recommended me this spot too. The interior made the ambiance very warm and comfy. I was surprised how small this place was, but it still fit a good amount of people I guess? Thankfully when I went, there was a wave of people leaving.  So to be perfectly honest, I was a little skeptical after looking at the prices and the sizes of their ramen ($16). I tried the Tonkatsu ramen which is a pork based broth ramen. When I took my first bite, I was pretty surprised!! The broth was super rich and flavorful, the noodles were cooked perfectly, and the pork jowl literally melted in my mouth! Also in terms of the portion, it was actually pretty filling because there were a lot of noodles in there and had 3-4 pieces of pork which is the average amount usually.  Overall, I would recommend trying this place out maybe if you're around the area or you feel like venturing out because there are also comparable ramen spots in the city.	4star
So it was my first time trying this place it was slightly busy but not too bad. We sat down ordered our apps one of the apps wasn't correct but we ate it anyway and then one of our apps came out after the food so we cancelled it .. our service not once asked if everything is okay if we want another drink nothing.. All and all the food was ok the vibe is nice but the service is terrible and no apology was made for the mistake nothing coming from a food and beverage background she Failed	3star
Had a quick lunch here today with my love and I must say service was quick and nice .. very tight space tho . We got very lucky with seating , we only waited two minutes.. so I'd suggest you get here by 12-12:30 ..( we were there on a Sunday ) , if u don't want to wait outside.  oh and bring your credit card , I realized they had two sides and the credit area was the one we got lucky with, since the cash side opens around 3pm.  Furthermore  after you're done, don't bother trying to mingle once they've seen that they have a line waiting and that you're done, here comes your bill and some guy ready to wipe your table lol  Two things stood out that I didn't like : (1). I had to share a lunch table with four people so u can't really be a big girl when it comes to being seated comfortably lol ( doesn't apply to me just saying from observation)  (2). I ordered the ramen soup with the egg .. the noodles tastes great but the broth was tooo floury for me .. I can't describe it but I couldn't finish the broth and they put way tooo much onions ... the atmosphere was great overall . Would I be back .. ehh I don't know..	3star
Excellent service and food. As soon as we walk inside I could feel the nice vibe this place has. We were sit down quickly and ask what we wanted to drink by an amazing waitress I really enjoyed my time here and the food was super delicious I ordered Cuban sandwich which was super delicious ans tasty. But my favorite of all was the patacones. I never had a more delicious patacon that the ones I had here. I really recommend you to order this if you are around. The coconut mojito was really good and I will definitely come back for a second time and tell everybody about this place.	5star
Excellent venue. Great food (good portions)  and very reasonable prices on specials. Prompt service and remarkably cosy given the location.	4star
On my 2nd visit to Gelso & Grand I was definitely more impressed with their food. I really enjoyed the duck ravioli special, and the calamari was quite good. The charcuterie platter had 1 cheese that was delicious and 1 that was blandly creamy, but both meats were frankly average. However, the service was just strange. My reviews are very rarely affected by service, but I have to knock a star here. Mostly, there is just too much service. Things like someone scraping the crumbs off your table felt unnecessary and over-the-top in a semi-casual setting like this. Our waiter was cloyingly attentive. Several times, he came and asked us how our dishes were before we'd even had a chance to have a bite. He collected our check 60 seconds after he'd put it on the table and (obviously) before we'd put down our payment. He asked us if we wanted a fresh basket of bread even though we had a full basket already. His attentive concern was so grandiose that it felt fake. The stream, too, of people refilling our water and whisking our plates away the second we'd finished was, frankly, annoying. Overall: the food is good, but the experience here was weird. I wouldn't necessarily avoid G&G because, for the area, the Italian food is good, but I certainly am not anxious to return.	3star
Went to Lupa with 4 friends to celebrate a birthday. We were expecting an amazing experience as we had heard so many great things. The food was average. I ordered the saltimbocca- it was plated so poorly. No color at all. Just a brown patty on my plate. Would not go back and would not recommend.	2star
I love me some Amy Ruth's! I've been trying to find the place to get the best soul food in NYC and I think I've found it! BONUS- the serve Lloyd's carrot cake!! You don't know what that is?!? You bettah ask somebody because it is literally the best carrot cake in the city and I'm a connoisseur  Pros- food! Location, price Cons- the actual setting (but this is largely personal preference) It's family style restaurant, not a fancy restaurant where you come, expects great modern decor, waiters who are poised etc. this isn't red rooster! But there are murals of famous black historical figures! The seating is like after church dinner in the church cafeteria (but I love this aspect because it reminds me of my childhood), the staff is always friendly, service is quick and the food is good. I've had the catfish which is delicious, my fiancé has had the beef ribs which he loved. I've come here with my mom who had the catfish and waffles which she bought were delicious. Oh, and the most important part, they got the Mac and cheese right!! Like his is so crucial and they did the damn thing. The greens are poppin (also the best I've had in the city) and the cornbread which they bring to the table when you sit is dynamite! This is my new go to soul food spot whether it's just me and my babe, friend late night after being in he area, or family. It's truly a space where all kinds of groups can come and enjoy a solid meal	5star
Please let it be known that I have been going to Dominick's since the early 1980's, when I started at Fordham U.  In 2001,  my friends held their wedding rehearsal dinner there, and we had a fabulous time.  I was there before the decor update, when the backdrop to the delicious Italian-American food was ugly simulated wood paneling, but no one cared, because the food was so good and the ambience was unique and lively.   Ever since they gussied up the place a few years ago, however, it's taken a downhill slide.  For the last few years, a Fordham friend and I have had an annual post-New Year's dinner there, but for the first time this year, we're going elsewhere (it pains me to say that!).  We've ordered pasta and tomato sauce with sausage, and on two different occasions, the sausage was waterlogged and tasteless. Last year, we got chicken marsala, which was topped with CANNED sliced mushrooms.    The bread is good, and everything else was passable, but it's not worth the hype anymore, IMHO.   I'm sure that others will disagree, but this has been my experience.	2star
"Went on a Saturday night around 6pm and the line wasn't so bad...however, it does move very slowly! The menu isn't very extensive and drinks are sold separately at the bar. Here's the breakdown: -brisket: a bit on the chewier (read: dry) side. meh, i've had better -lamb belly: pretty darn good. fatty, a little gamey. so yum! my fave of the meats. -chicken: a-okay. interestingly, it has a ginger/scallion sauce on the side that is very reminiscent of a Chinese ""white cut chicken."" -jamaican jerk ribs: pretty standard ribs. i liked them, would probably order again -sausage: you can definitely taste that they're homemade and very fresh (not smokey, and not over-seasoned with salt/nitrates).  -mac and cheese: bleh. way too salty and cheese is overwhelming. pass.  -potato salad: my fave side. just perfect.  -coleslaw: it's alright, just had to order some vegetables, because everything is fatty meat or carbs.  The bar had a nice variety of beers on tap. Got my six point sweet action and this mild cider that tastes like carbonated apple juice my brother really liked. :P"	4star
"So I'm in the area looking for BBQ.  This was the first place to pop up! 4 stars w/ 135 reviews... ""how bad could it be""... Dang it! You yelpers let me down!  Since I was solo, i just wanted a quick bite. I decided on the ""infamous"" Meat Candy and a side salad. Everyone raved about this damn Meat Candy...  The meat candy was not as large as I expected for $13. The first bite was pretty yummy.. it wasn't until bite 5-6 that I realized it was super super salty! Like drink water before and after each bite salty! My other issue w/ the dish was it was not very warm, more like room temperature warm.  I don't see what everyone was raving about! I've had burnt ends in the past and love them, but these just didn't win me over.   My Farmers Salad was like eating lettuce w/ nothing else. Thank goodness for the cranberries for giving this dish some kick.  Overall, I'm kind of disappointed... not sure if I wld be back. Maybe my taste buds were off tonight."	3star
Came here to celebrate my sister-in-law's birthday. We wanted to go to the best Thai restaurant in Queens because we were going to go laser tag afterward. Did not disappoint; food + service is AMAZING! They had speciality desserts and food that we never seen is other Thai restaurants.	4star
i've only been here once and i have to wonder if the high rating comes from the happy hour specials and not the tacos. came here for some lunch because gueros was closed and chavela's was on our way back towards the station. the waitress was extremely curt with us and our orders took forever to arrive, though all we ended up ordering were a few tacos each. i had the nopales and bistec, which were both terrible. the tortilla was dry, the filling was unspectacular and had no real special flavor. one of the bistec tacos that we ordered barely had three chunks of steak inside. we tried to salvage the meal with some flan and bread pudding for dessert, but a good lunch was just not in the cards - wayyy too sweet. i have friends who've cooked me better steak, flan, and bread pudding. not expensive but not worth it	1star
Yet another situation in which I really wish Yelp had the half star option...  3.5*: Is it me or does anyone else think this place looks a little janky inside? Upon entering, you have to walk through a narrow space between the bar and the open kitchen. It's a cute concept, except there were food scraps all over the floor. It's not visually appealing or sanitary.  That being said, the food was still delicious. I had to get the cheese wheel pasta, because why else would you come here? The cheese wheel dish did not disappoint (I added a lot of fresh ground pepper for a cacio e pepe-type upgrade) and it sure did make for a good Boomerang  That being said, the best thing I ate at Basta Pasta was NOT the cheese wheel pasta. It was the pumpkin gnocchi in a sage cream sauce- drooooooooool. We split this as an appetizer, but I wish I got three and had it as my entree.  I'm glad I came for the cheese wheel experience and pumpkin gnocchi, but other than that it's just pretty eh.	3star
Everyone else seemed to have a good experience so I'm not sure what happened. The host wrote us down on the list and seemingly forgot about us. After she seemed surprised when we asked how much longer it would be she told us another wait time. Pretty bummed out that we didn't get to try it.	1star
I really liked the food here. We had the baby ribs the rotisserie chicken and the spinach meatball pasta all three dishes were amazing. My only complain would be that it's a cash only restaurant so it's a bit inconvenient. Other than that great place to eat highly recommended	5star
Must read before going through an embarrassing situation.  First and foremost the food here is really good and we usually have family here all the time for special events. With that said we always leave a good tip.  Today unfortunately was the lowest I've ever seen any restaurant - while the food was exceptional, the guests service was not. Our waiter was kind and patient but the person handing out our food was not, when he gave out the first set of dishes I had asked if it was the Thai fried rice that I had ordered to be spicy and he just said yes and bluntly left our table. The second set he laid the plate in the middle without asking whose it was. That's when the confusion came about, I ended up eating half of my brothers dish without realizing until our waiter pointed it out. But the weird part was, they messed up the order anyways because the Thai fried rice I was eating was the only spicy dish. When our dessert came, I began handing my leftovers to make space on the table, the same food handler places it in front of me while knocking a dirty napkin on my lap and doesn't even take the dirty plate away! I had to awkwardly hand it to someone in my party that had space.  To add insult to injury, I leave a terrible tip only to find the lady stopping me from leaving and asking why I left such a small tip and almost forcing me to add more. Unbelievable! This has been the first time someone has ever done this to me in all my life. I explained everything and still she stood there eying for a better tip, you've got to be kidding me. From now on, I'll just stick to take-out but I hope they really learn NOT to go after people who tip lower than the suggested amount because there might be something wrong with the actual service.	1star
I would give this location 0 stars but since that's not possible 1 star it is. Came here on a Sunday to enjoy some lobster rolls after touring around Time Square, but was extremely disappointed. We arrived 10 minutes before opening hour hoping to be the first to order a lobster roll. Not only was the person opening up 20 minutes late, but she had a bad attitude when asked when they'll be taking orders. If you ever come to this location, I'll recommend going around 1PM since the workers there can't seem to wake up from their hangovers.	1star
Nothing good about this place told us wait is 20 mins but lasted 45 mins .. then the waitress never gave us menus at once .. it was six of us we all had to ask her for menus 6 separate times ... food came really .. food was very very oily .. it was dripping ... waitress kept eyeing one of my friends for no reason .. I wish I could even take the one star away	1star
I think this place is overhyped - I wasn't a huge fan of the food. My date and I ordered the calamari, linguine with clams, sweet potato fries and fish tacos. The only thing we really enjoyed were the calamari - it stayed crispy from start until finish. The linguine we had was way too salty and not enjoyable. The tacos were just ok but very over priced. Sweet potato fries came with ketchup - I thought that was strange. We were seated outside on a nice Friday night at 7pm but it smelled like garbage. There was garbage bags around the area - I think Management should be more aware of the smell going on out there. Service was good. Our waitress checked on us a few times and was very patient.	3star
Greek salad was really strange and NOT what is meant by a Greek salad in Greece or better NY restaurants. But the most sad thing was that I got severe food poisoning during the lunch here. Given that I didn't eat anything prior to that and after, this was clearly from this place. Avoid.	1star
"The food is okay here, but the décor is what steals the show. It's adorable and rustic and well thought out, even in the bathroom. The radio even. What a nice touch!  My friend and I got here at 10:30am on a Sunday, so we had no wait being seated. Had there been a line, we wouldn't have waited.  I got the eggs in purgatory. Get this if you're into grits. It was a bit too bland and forgettable for me. But it filled me up and it's pretty healthy if that's what you're looking for. My friend got the crab benedict, and she liked it. I had a bite and liked it too.  Service was good. Coffee kept being refilled. Food came out quickly. I say give it a shot if there's no wait. It's become one of those places that you ""have"" to try just because."	3star
A little on the pricey side for brunch. $14 just for one cocktail. The food was delicious, I particularly enjoyed the dutch apple pancake which was more like a breakfast version of apple brown betty or an apple crisp without the excess sugar. There was a bit of a wait but I would return if I was in the highline area.	4star
This is my second time at kyklades. The grilled octopus is what keeps on bringing my family back. Stuffed shrimp, lemon potatoes, salmon steak, swordfish. All of it is super yummy!  They had AMAZING Greek custard for dessert. It was the perfect end to our dinner. I won't even try to spell it even if I remembered what it was called, but it had cinnamon on it. I'm sure if you ask the waiter they would immediately tell you. It is a MUST try!!	4star
Stopped in here last night for a dinner date before heading to the cinema.  Was told 30 minutes wait for a table. (Open table was not working for their restaurant) 30 mints passed and was told another 20. We ended up eating at the bar. Glad we did because it ended up Being another 30 minutes wait for a table. Food was only okay. We ordered the cheesesteak spring rolls which were the highlight of the meal. My partner ordered the fish and chips which were okay. I ordered the salmon which was so bland and tasteless it was sad. Margarita was great, beer selection was good.  All in all... it's a decent spot. Try to find a way to make reservations because they clearly don't know how to seat anyone in a timely manner.	3star
Came here last night with a vegetarian friend of mine--I guess I can thank Vinegar Hill for reminding me of the valuable lesson to always check the menu before going to a new place (they offer virtually no vegetarian options). Aside from that, not much to speak of here. Snobby, pretentious crowd despite a warm and intimate ambiance. The only thing waitstaff seems to care less about than your dining experience is their manners.  I have to admit though, the asparagus with what tasted like basil and pine nuts was yummy--as well as the pistachio ice cream, which had a syrupy aftertaste and a velvety, homemade texture. Wine selection is great.  I've had much better and way worse, but overall if you're looking for a date/dinner spot, go to Superfine a few blocks away or take a 15 min walk to Brooklyn Heights and explore the eateries in that area. This is one of those places that gives you a meal at a price tag much higher than what your dining experience was actually worth.	2star
Get the cornmeal pancakes. They were amazing. Everything else was, meh. The potatoes were over fried and my eggs tasted like they were marinated in butter. Just not the type of cooking  I would expect from farm to table restaurant.	3star
I was not impressed.  Service was very sweet but average, nothing spectacular. The mac & cheese was delicious and so what this duck spread we tried. However, my scallops were bland with no seasoning and it all just tasted funny. the octopus had no seasoning as well and was barely one tentacle, mostly vegetables and fillers. The cauliflower, usually a favorite of mine was a salt bomb.. Really disappointed. I came in due to great reviews but I didn't taste what the other reviewers were tasting about..	2star
I had dinner at Calle Ocho with a few of my family members and we enjoyed everything we ordered. The menu has a lot of variety and I had a tough time choosing what to order because everything sounded good. Flavors are good, prices are reasonable, and portions are large -- lots of leftovers. Also they currently have a Yelp check-in special AND a Groupon so check that out before going!	4star
There was a line out the door for lunch so we decided to try it. The falafel sandwich was dry and mostly iceburg lettuce topped with watery sauce. The chicken souvlaki sandwich was bland and became mush from the watery lettuce and sauce. Took one bite and threw it away.	2star
My last night in NY and this place hit the spot. Seafood pasta and a glass of wine. Perfection.	5star
Everything started out wonderfully on this, my first and last visit.  Arrived at 10, I believe.  Maybe a bit before.  The waiter did tell us the kitchen closed at 10:30 and the restaurant at 11.  We didn't really think anything of it.  We ordered our appetizers and dinner within 20 minutes.   After we ordered food, we never saw the waiter again.  We were asked a couple of times if we needed anything else, but oddly this guy that worked there kept refilling our wine glasses from the bottle we had.  It was clear the 3rd time this was a rush job.  The check didn't show up and at like 11:00 sharp, the music was turned off and the bright lights turned on.  There had only been us and 2 other parties in the place.  Another several minutes passed before our check was brought to us.  The whole experience started off fine, but mostly was just awful.  We just couldn't relax and enjoy ourselves.  We spent about $140 on this dinner, so, I would expect to at least be able to finish our wine at our own pace, or at least get the check before the lights and music stopped.  Incidentally,  down the street, another place was very busy, was closed as well, but nobody was being rushed out.  I would say spend your money elsewhere.	1star
I live around the corner, miss the yoga studio that used to be here before this restaurant took over. Disappointing experience. Food was ok, not great. A bit slow. Tiny portions for the price, felt like a rip off :/	2star
Came in for lunch. There were only 3 other customers there and we placed our order for chicken curry and Lamb chops. The bread and soup were good (not sure if we were supposed to get salad too as part of the lunch special). 10 mins later 6 groups came in and they all got their food first (including a salad). When our order arrived 30 mins later they gave me a chicken kebab instead of my order and the lamb chops were tiny and were half bone.... the check came fast though.  Totally caught off guard because of the great reviews. Not worth the $28 lunch. We left hungry. Never going back.	1star
3.5-4 stars. I think my expectations for this place were set a tad bit high, but it was still a good experience overall. Really like the atmosphere here: It's trendy, fun, and slightly dark but in a completely non-creepy way. I also really like the big wheel you get to spin: we won a kimchi jar (literally kimchi in a jar), which was a great staple Korean appetizer to start with.  I ordered the uni bibimbap, which was definitely the most unique bibimbap I've ever had. I'm not sure how I felt about it though, to be honest. I really liked the individual ingredients (the roe, uni, etc.) but they didn't really come together in a way that I found pleasing. I think I prefer the traditional stone bowl bibimbap, but I'm glad I was able to have this extremely different experience at Barn Joo. Probably not going to replace my go-to places in K-town, but definitely worth a try!	4star
Have to admit, wasn't very happy to have to come here for a late night basketball game (whooo go warriors)  it's a bit further out on south street, smells pretty fishy but whatever right. Don't expect glam and modern chic, this is a good old fashion bar with a few tables.  You got a jukebox and big flatscreen tv and a smaller one on the side. The owner is pretty amazing I have to say, he gets to know you and socialize with you and yes, he is always bringing out the shots. The food is pretty good, definitely Asian.  I was told it was his mom that does all the cooking.  The shrimp and dry sausage fried rice tho, pretty darn good.  The yummy noodles - that was good too.  Curry and spicy, there were some seafood in it as well.  Not bad for a bar!	4star
The LAMB CHOPS. That's all I gotta say. Try them and you will see what I'm talking about. GREAT STAFF. Location is on the low hard to notice unless your looking for it. Great place reminds me of a movie. Harry potters hogwarts..I love this place great food.	5star
The place is Great 2 for 1 drink specials are great but The staff is a huge mess from the Managers to the servers and bartenders. I went on a Weds eve. Servers drinking at the bar and the bartenders serving them self drinks as well. I find it odd I was hit on by a man wearing a river walk T-shirt I assumed he was a bartender he was obsessed with the TV and the volume but rarely made a drink for anyone but himself. I came to find out that he was not a manager or bartender he is the owner. I overheard him comment on a guests breast and then a servers. This place is a frat house at best. I loved the food and the drinks 2 for 1 you can't beat it. I will keep myself and my breast away from this bar I am out for a good time but this place is a sexual harassment suit waiting to happen. I really felt bad for the waitress.	1star
We got the Mexican corn & roasted pork tacos. The corn was sooo delicious, tasted just like it does in Mexico! Very authentic. The tacos were so juicy, I recommend! The place is small like a San Diego taco shop, not fancy but so tasty.	4star
Catering to the Yelp generation, Chef Morimoto (yes, the Iron Chef) has truly outdone himself by slapping the Momosan name & logo on everything, including  the seaweed in your ramen. That being said...you know me, I soaked it all in. Like YAS let me tell all my friends where I'm eating at. Favorite of the evening: Peking duck ($5 a pop, also surprisingly one of the few menu items w/out a pic). A fusion twist on the traditional Peking duck that comes in a thin pancake wrap or bun, this appetizer comes in a crispy gyoza taco-like shell. The textures and flavors in each bite complemented each other so well. Chef Morimoto, you are a culinary genius #bless Honorable mentions: Tonkotsu ramen ($10 small, $13 large) and Zuke Don ($9). The noodles were perfectly chewy. The ramen broth was creamy, rich, and flavorful, albeit rather salty. Also where the meat at? Stingy. Zuke Don was well-seasoned yet similarly salty. While delicious,  -1 star because I legit downed 6 glasses of water by the end of dinner. Abnormal. Would I come again if I'm near Grand Central Station? Yes, of course. Will I hydrate throughout the day to prepare myself for the douse of sodium/MSG? Yes. Note: Seating only occurs once your entire party arrives.	4star
Horrible. Super long wait- was told 20-25 minutes and ended up waiting an hour. Small portions for the priced paid, patrons are RATCHET as hell. Would love to support a BOB but, fast service and decent sized portions are important to me. With that said, whenever I need my seafood fix, I'll go to the spot on Church and East 96th-where you're in and out in 15 and the potions are decent.	1star
This is my first review ever but these people are so unbelievable that I have to do it. I would never eat here simply because the people who run or work at this restaurant are so incredibly rude. They use a shared alley space to throw parties until 2am on work nights with huge speakers blaring music..in a tiny alley with multiple apartment buildings backed to it. As I speak they are shining a huge bright spotlight and working with a generator and loud power tools.. At 1am keeping all of the neighbors up. When multiple neighbors ask or yell in frustration and sleep deprivation for them to stop they yell and laugh and continue on doing whatever they want to do with no respect for their neighbors - some elderly, or with sleeping babies, or even just people who have to get up early for work. Shame on you for the reflection this has on your business and showing zero respect for your neighborhood.	1star
My girlfriend and I recently went here for brunch and honestly I was a little disappointed.  First of all I need to discuss the service, which ruined the experience more than anything else.  We arrived at 11am on a Satursay and there was only one waitress working, which didn't really faze me, as Kevin's is not a large place, but unfortunately the poor girl was totally overwhelmed.  She brought water over relatively promptly, and it was all downhill after that.  We waited probably 15 minutes to place our order, waited another 10 minutes for the French press of coffee (inexcusable for something that literally takes 10 seconds to prepare) and close to 30 minutes for our food.  That's where the adventure really started as I saw my girlfriends order head to someone else's table and had to grab the waitress and tell her.  She then brought out my order a few minutes later, and gave my father-in-law someone else's order (scrambled eggs instead of an omelet), which again we needed to inform her of and she corrected.  Going 1 out of 3 in getting the correct order to the table is just not acceptable.  Also my girlfriend asked several times for more water and only got it after we received the check.   So as you could imagine the food would have had to be something spectacular to make up for the service, and to be honest it just wasn't.  My girlfriend had the Eggs Chesapeake, which looked better on paper than it was, although the crab cake was decent.  I ordered the Challah French Toast and, whilst it was satisfying enough, it was just a little on the boring side and something that you can get at any number of places with much better service.  Finally my father-in-law had the omelet, which could have been had at any diner for half the price and equal quality. Overall, the food was just ok and the service was terrible so we will not be returning.	2star
OMG! This place is AH-MAZING!!!  My sis and I were seated (by request) in the garden area. I wasn't sure what to expect when she told me about it because the restaurant is located on a busy street; however, it was cute. (Hint: Nice date location!)  Service -Fantastic! Not much to say, because they were all on point! No complaints. Very friendly and attentive! Food - I ordered the Battuta Di Pollo (chicken breast) and subbed the mixed veggies for spinach. OMG! I literally almost made my stomach burst from lack of control of continuing to eat this meal! Thank God there is so much walking required in NYC, because I pretty much almost popped a seam. The chicken was juicy and seasoned perfectly. The spinach had a little perfect crunch, but was also tender at the same time. How is this even possible? It, too, was seasoned perfectly! My sis ordered a pasta dish (sorry, do not know the name). It looked plain, but she was was in heaven! She added some of my spinach to it and also complained of a hurt belly from the inability to stop eating the food. SO FREAKING DELICIOUS!!!!!!!! I do not think that I can say that Italian is my least favorite food anymore, because I will return to this restaurant EVERY time I visit NYC! Absolutely recommend! I am getting hungry just thinking about it...	5star
"The River Cafe definitely has its group of regulars. If not, slipping cash while forging a handshake can make you into one. I was not even shocked when a man slipped the maitre d a bunched-up bill before sliding into his window seat next to our table with his date for the night. Tourists: It doesn't get more New York than that if you're looking for an ""authentic"" experience.  Ambiance: I arrived with my mom (party of 2) for dinner early on a Saturday night. The crowd was much older than I expected, with elderly couples pining for the window seats. The views were great but you can also get the same view outside on a bench for free. If you're planning to come for the view or the general ambiance, I'd recommend another establishment.  Food: The only reason I rounded up to 3 stars is because the food was better than I thought it would be (although quite underwhelming) and definitely not at the level that it merits a Michelin star. The desserts, however, were on point. We had the Chocolate Brooklyn Bridge and the Sorbet Plate, which were perfect compliments to one another. The portion sizes are generous and we left stuffed even after just two courses each.  Service: Our food-runner was generally pleasant, and kindly explained each dish as it came out, but the server who took our order did not ask if we needed any recommendations, nor asked if we had any questions. The service was average compared to other New York restaurants, and sub-par compared to other Michelins.  THE HOSTESS AT THE FRONT TOTALLY RUINED THE EXPERIENCE FOR US IN THE BEGINNING. She greeted us, and when I said that we had a reservation, she asked if we were familiar with the menu. I said no, but I was fully aware that it was a fixed price dinner. She said she would bring it over anyway to make sure we were ""comfortable with it"" (aka the price).  Once she went over to call the matire d, I stared at the other hostess with a flat expression and said, ""I said, we have a reservation. Are you going to let me in or not?"" She looked flustered and apologized profusely, making an excuse that she didn't hear that the first time around.  Besides this slightly minor setback, the overall experience was good. Good but not great. I will not return."	3star
Decent brunch. I'm not sure why it is so hard to get a reservation here or why people wait so long. I got the avocado toast which I know is basic but it was nothing special. My husband got the Benedict which was also nothing to write home about. I like that a cocktail is included so I can't hate too much. I think this place would be good for groups	3star
Another diamond in a rough .. in Chinatown this time. One of the best rated taco joints in the area. Dine in area has high table set up with barstools. Once you order the food at the counter, they'll bring food to where you're seated. 3 tacos are about $10 but generously stuffed with meat/veggies, depending on what you get. Lots of Cholula hot sauces for you to utilize as well.	5star
MUMUMU! I love everything about this place!	5star
Wow! Really impressed with this little thai restaurant. We came on a Sunday night at 8pm and it was packed!! The wait was 1.5hrs, so we decided to get it to go and eat at home. Not a bad idea! (The food only took 15min to prepare). The pork and egg crab noodle was a really nice dish to start with especially if you pour in the sauce it comes with so it gives it that little sour taste. Really opens up your appetite.  The curry puffs were surprisingly yummy! I was expecting it to be super dry and since its take out for the puff part to not be very good anymore. But the puff was holding up really well! Very fluffy and not dry at all.  The crab fried rice was amazing! (We ended up having some left over and I heated it up in the microwave the next morning and still tasted superb). I'd recommend adding some chili flakes they give you and some lemon if you like it slightly sour.  The chicken wings were also good but not mind blowing so next time I would skip this one and try something else.  Affordable and authentic thai.	5star
Disappointed. The meat/salsa/everything was fine - but the tortilla wasn't great and fell apart almost instantly....forcing me to eat a taco with a fork. I've never felt more white.  The place was okay, a bit too full - the tables were too close together, making conversation awkward. Music was nice, staff was friendly enough.  Drinks were good, but I won't be coming back, a taco place with crappy tortillas just isn't worth a second visit.	2star
The champagne tipsy tea was delightful. Didnt realize it was iced tea until it arrived, but that was a pleasant surprise. Also LOVED my frisee salad (subbed feta, no blue cheese). My friend said his burger and beer were excellent. The venue is really interesting. There was live music for Sunday brunch.	5star
This was absolutely THE WORST experience I have ever had at a restaurant. EVER.  My boyfriend and I live in the area and this place came highly recommended to us by the owners at a local deli. We decided to go on a Friday night after work. The place itself wasn't that busy, there were quite a few tables open and available, but when we walked in, no one even acknowledged that we were there. In fact, we stood in front of what I assumed was the owner sitting at the front desk for about ten minutes before he even looked at us. He placed us at a table for four, even though our party was for two, and while I appreciated the extra space, it was in the front of the restaurant so the waiter didn't even acknowledge us for about 10 minutes after we sat down.  We ordered wine and some water, it took another 10 minutes just for that to come. The whole time we basically had to flag down a waiter if we wanted anything. They didn't even come to take our plates away! I can't even tell you which one was our waiter because of the four men manning the tables, not one of them came back to our table more than once. It was a different one each time. Clearly there was no organization going on. The best was when (what I assumed was) the owner ignored us when we wanted more water so that he could LITERALLY COUNT HIS MONEY at the host's table.  It seemed like the other patrons were being payed much more attention to than we were, and I wasn't sure why this was. I guess you have to know the owner in order to get decent service at this place.  The food itself was nothing to cry about. At times we even actually enjoyed it. The bread with the peppers and olive oil was good, but its nothing I couldn't make at home. We also ordered calamari and a bread with anchovies. I've had better calamari at Thai Village, up the street. Yes, I said I've had better calamari at a THAI place. As an Italian girl, I was pretty insulted by the calamari.  I had veal scallopini with mushrooms for the entree and my boyfriend had a roman veal dish. Both were rubbery and overcooked with salty sauces. Honestly, if I wanted to spend this much on Italian food, I'd just make it myself. It would definitely save me the aggravation of having to deal with old men ignoring me in a poorly decorated restaurant.	1star
This is a nice hangout spot. The corn is good and so are the tacos. I like the outside seating. It's more of an adult vibe, but I bring my kids and we have a good time.	4star
"Worst margarita pizza ever. I came to Little Italy to taste real Italian margarita but got pizza like from cheap fast food. Junk shit... One more - when I done my dinner and asked for check waiter said that they didn't accept ""discover"" credit cards. It was surprised for me because i didn't saw any note or signs that they didn't accept this type of card. Manager said that I can go and find some ATM to take cash and paid for my dinner. ""Perfect"" service and 1 star review, bitches."	1star
My favorite soup dumpling place in Chinatown! Pretty good service and friendly staff every time we visit. We usually get the crab meat soup dumplings and the shanghai lo mein which taste amazing. Most place makes it too greasy but this place makes it just right and will leave you wanting more!	5star
The food was good. Ordered the samplers. The fritters were good but the jerk chicken wings wernt as yummy. The dessert was below average, not tasty at all except the coconut icecream, that was good.	3star
So, I got an email from Burger and Lobster wanting to invite me back. LET ME BE CLEAR, even if they offered me 5 lbs of lobster for free, and for 20 of my closest friends, I WOULD NEVER go back.  The food was rancid. This was one of the worst, WORST, dining experiences EVER.  I have to say, I was really looking forward to coming to B&L. The hubby was excited because his BFF is coming to town soon, and the new of them love to dine out. But WOW. To be blunt, two bites into my burger and lobster called The Beast and I was wishing I was at Shake Shack, which I loathe and find repulsive. That's how bad this $30 piece of crap on a plate. This was the kind of burger I would expect to get from one of those street truck vendors, greasy and all kinds of wrong, and not in the good way. Seriously, if I didn't know better, I would have thought the lobster was some kind of imitation. I'll trust that it wasn't. There was nothing appetizing about it. Then there was the hubby's burger. The fois gras he described as fois dirt. I can not remember hating a restaurant as much as I hated this one. A horrible meal. The lobster bites were edible. But really, put something in a doughy filling, and it'll probably be doable. But, it seemed like something you'd find on sale in the supermarket frozen section. I'm not entirely sure they didn't get it there. If I could give no stars I would. The service was okay. Though, I'm not sure who our waiter was. It changed twice. And, not because it was busy. It was 5:30. The customers were pretty sparse. Just not sure they knew what was going on. There is nothing about this experience that I ever want to repeat. Don't get the hype. Though, we did go to a movie after, and  I gained an appreciation for concession stand food. I envied the lucky folks eating that crap. Even the fries were horrible. Who messes up fries? My recommendation, stay home and throw Velveeta on some Spam. It'll probably taste close to our meal.	1star
I needed to grab a quick bite before a movie and decided to venture over to Pig & Khao, as I've been wanting to try it for awhile now.  I ate at the bar and had a delicious (and filling) dinner of the peanuts and the pork jowl. The peanuts were absolutely delicious with deep flavors and a nice warm aroma to them. The pork jowl was right on-par with reviews I've read on it. Both were well cooked, full of flavor and a little out of the ordinary from what I'd normally select. So, it was a great little sampling of what this place has to offer.  All in all, the meal came out to under $20, which is what shocked me the most. I thought it would be about $10 more, after having glanced at a few of the prices on my walk over.  If I had any complaints about this place it would be that there was too much cilantro in the pork jowl. For most people it probably wouldn't be an issue. But, I'm one of those weirdos that can't eat it without tasting floral soap. I should also mention that every single person working there that night was amazing. The staff really is a highlight of the experience. They take great care to ensure you enjoy yourself.	4star
One of my favorite places to grab a bite. The food, especially the Thai Noodles are amazing. I would recommend getting them dry instead of wet, it gives a bit more flavor in my opinion. During lunch time it can get a bit busy and hectic. Only reason why it's not 5/5 is because of the size. It's a small little place, and during rush hour the wait can be a bit long. However, do not let that discourage you.  P.S. Try their specialty dessert!	4star
I have no idea how this place stays in business, but I am so glad it does. For brunch, you can received unlimited complimentary glasses of sangria. Granted, they pack a punch, so I could never really have more than two glasses if I want to accomplish anything else in that day. My boyfriend and I shared the Gallitos which says it can serve two. We both have big appetites, but there was enough food to have leftovers to take home! So for $36 we got a big meal, leftovers, and two glasses of sangria each. Such a great deal. The vibe is fun with colorful decorations and lively music.	5star
Friend brought me here to try my first bite of new York pizza! Wait time was a long 45 minutes but worth it! Had some of their rigatoni and their vodka pizza. My favorite of the two was honestly the pasta. I think I'll try another pizza next time. The small size  is more than enough for two people. It is HUGE. Ambiance was very noisy and the space is narrow. Didn't like that there was one unisex bathroom. Had to hold my pee for a bit until it cleared up. I think overall service was great.	4star
Really liked the food food at this place. It seemed like it is just kind of a standard bar with pub food but there is this small amount of Mediterranean food on the menu and that's what I ordered. The grilled octopus was great. Good size portions. The only thing I would comment negatively on is the decor. It was somewhat lacking, very plain with just wood everywhere. Also the servers could use a little more training.	4star
What an incredible handful of bites. I got the Tempura Fish and if you took a picture of it you could see the layers of a slaw with fried wontons and a fun orange spicy sauce. The fish didn't taste too fishy but was complimented by each layer.  Flour tortilla could not hold it all but I can live with that. Can not wait to come back and try more of the food.	5star
"Man, kind of sad about this one! While visiting NYC recently, the hubby and I were craving a NY style slice of pizza after a long and exhausting day at the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. Being the foodie that I am, I quickly turned to my other Yelpers for some help! I saw that this place had tons of reviews and good stars! What I didn't check was the ""type"" of pizza that was served here. It's not your traditional NY slice, that is large and thin and hanging off of the side of the plate. It's a thicker style, served square. In addition, I wasn't even thinking that what we WERE looking for, was pizza by the slice, which they also do not do.  This place is located in the financial district and gets a lot of traffic, especially on a Friday, from work-goers! I liked the outside setup and how all of the restaurants were lined up on the one street and all shared benches and covered areas. This saved our experience some. While we didn't get exactly what we were hoping for, at least we got to enjoy an ice-cold (over priced beer, lol) while sitting outside and enjoying the lovely day.  So, we ended up ordering the lasagna and splitting it. We decided to forego the pizza and keep on our search. Also, the pizzas were pricey here! Approximately $25 for a basic pizza and you had to pay additional fees to add toppings, even pepperoni!! Really? Pepperoni is not a staple? Yeah, it would have been close to a $30 pizza. It probably cost them $5 to make it! No thanks. But, let me talk about the lasagna. It was under $20 and a pretty large serving with a good amount of meat and cheese. I thought the texture was good and I enjoyed the sweetness of the marinara sauce. However, I did think the cheese was a bit on the salty side and I found myself in a desperate search for more sweet sauce to offset the saltiness. They give you a side of bread (slightly burnt... I guess that's the ""in"" way to do it?) which was a nice add.  Overall, just a 3 star rating from me. Very pricey and not your typical NY slice. Although I don't want to beat them up too much since I didn't actually give the pizza a try. It might be good, just not what we were looking for that day. Follow me on my way to Foodietown! "	3star
Seems like a good place for a lively and special occasion brunch, but is definitely overrated in my opinion. Some of the tapas were great, but others were a miss. My favorite dishes were the lemon ricotta pancakes, eggplant pizzetta, and braised chicken meatballs. The biggest disappointments were the grilled cheese tomato soup dumplings which came out completely cold... Totally unacceptable for soup to ever be served cold. You can definitely get better brunch in this area of Manhattan for a fraction of the price at other nice, trendy places.	3star
Went there Sunday night at around 8:30 pm. There was a wait time to be seated outside, but there were tables open inside. It was pretty packed in there, and you are seated closely with other diners. It has a nice, and dark ambiance. Candles, and fresh flowers in the middle of the table. We had the Braised Short Rib Sliders as the appetizer, Lemon Crusted Chilean Seabass, and Lamb Three Ways for our entree. Sliders were full of flavor. The patty was compile of many strings of tender meat. It was a treat! The Seabass's portion was relatively small for the price you pay, but the quality makes up for it. It literally melted in my mouth. Definitely requires some skills to prepare that dish. Lamb was amazing. Different parts were served, so you are exposed to different cuts of the lamb. The chickpea fries was a great compliment to go along with. This is a borderline $$$ location, but I felt that it was worth it at the end.	4star
If you guys going there then you have no idea what you eating . Was sitting at the bar and kitchen door was open , one of the cooks dropped plantain on the floor and after he picked it up to fry .... Who ever got that .... Sorry for them. Hopefully health department can close it down . So disgusting	1star
For my 200th review, I waited patiently to review the highly popular Ippudo NY on 4th avenue. As you can tell, this place is wildly popular. It was also recommended by my friend's sister, we decided to check out the ramen at this spot on a Saturday night. It was pretty busy on a Saturday night, and without reservations, we had about a 2 hour wait for 2 people. They put us on a waitlist, and we killed sometime strolling around. Unfortunately, they gave us an underestimated time when we first checked in so by time we got back we had to wait a while, but not a real big problem. Ippudo is actually setup pretty well. Right when you walk in past the curtains, there's a bar and waiting area for those looking to relax and get a drink or some appetizers. If you want to wait, they'll put your name down, party number, and take your number which they will text you as soon as your table's ready. There's table seating as well as bar seating. We were situated at a shared table with others. Service was very prompt and friendly, as soon as the host walks you in, the cooks shout out with enthusiasm, really bringing the whole place together. We were pretty hungry, and decided to go out for our first meal in the city. A couple of beers, pork bun and wings as appetizers, and two bowls of ramen with eggs ran about $95 for 2 people. I guess not terrible for the amount of quality food we got, but a little pricier for ramen. The pork bun was awesome, I would definitely recommend to everyone. The bun was super soft and tasty. The wings were pretty good, but for the price and since wings get pretty messy, I probably wouldn't get it again. On the plus side, they do give you a wet nap, which is a nice touch. Moving onto the ramen, I ordered the akumaru modern, which is basically tonkotsu ramen, with some slight changes. The broth was delicious, but I thought the noodles were just okay. It also came with their special miso paste, which was very savory. Overall, I wanted to like it more especially with all the hype and time it took for it to get to us. Of course, it filled me up especially on a cold night, and wouldn't hesitate to go again if I didn't have to wait 2 hours. Overall, this place gets about a 4.5 out of 5, but based on this visit, I'm rounding down. I would definitely recommend calling in for reservations so you don't have to wait. There were just small little things keeping this place from getting a 5, but nonetheless, definitely a place you have to check out if you're in NYC,	4star
I missed the lunch special which stops at 4pm since I arrived at 4:20pm! I really wanted to try seafood pasta but they don't offer lunch special menu after 4:00pm so I got chicken kebab and Greek style hamburger for our table. The beet and lemon potatoes side dishes were huge and the food was decent. The only reason why I'm leaving 4 star rating instead of 5 star rating is because while the food was good, I thought the price was expensive as I had similar Greek dishes with same quality for cheaper price elsewhere in Astoria.	4star
"I've always noticed Traif listed on Yelp's Best of Brooklyn feature, so one day on a whim I randomly asked my friend if he wanted to try it with me. We ended up getting a reservation for a Sunday night, surprisingly easy to book only a few days before. The interior of the restaurant feels kind of like a bar - dark, low-key, and a little cramped. The kitchen is completely open though, and features this abstract, colorful mural that spans the ceiling. My friend and I spent a while debating whether or not the open kitchen was the only kitchen in the restaurant... it was as far as we could tell, which makes it extra impressive how they're able to produce so much amazing food in such a small space! There's a really nice-looking patio in the back of the restaurant too, but it was unfortunately full by the time we got there. The menu consists entirely of small plates, and our server explained to us that the items are listed from lightest to heaviest. The concept of Traif is best described as ""eclectic,"" and we took literally forever to decide what to order because everything looked so interesting. We ended up getting-- 1) Chilled mint and pea soup (amuse-bouche) - Incredibly refreshing on a hot summer day, though a bit heavy on the salt. 2) Shannon's bacon fat focaccia - Came with a side of bacon marmalade and creamy buttermilk ricotta. The bacon marmalade was like a gritty, slightly sweet bacon paste, and paired so well with the focaccia. This was easily my favorite dish of the entire meal, and I normally don't even like bacon, so this is saying a lot! 3) Dayboat scallops - Served with snap and English pea risotto. The scallops were perfectly seared and buttered, and came topped with capers and bits of tomato. The risotto was nice and creamy, the flavor of pea subtly there. 4) Spicy bigeye tuna tartare - The tartare was served on top of slices of Japanese eggplant tempura and then drizzled with kecap manis (which I had to look up - apparently it's Indonesian sweet soy sauce.) Eaten together, they paired really well and tasted almost like Japanese curry.  5) Strawberry-cinnamon glazed Berkshire baby back ribs - The glaze was amazing and incredibly sweet, but this was the only dish I didn't love. The meat itself was dry and not very tender. The strawberry slices thrown in were a nice touch, though. 6) BBQ braised short rib sliders - The short rib was incredibly tender and juicy, and I easily polished off my slider in a couple of bites. The sweet potato fries with paprika aioli, served on the side, were also pretty good. This dish was another favorite of the night. 7) Buttermilk panna cotta - This was also amazing. The panna cotta was incredibly milky and smooth, and got a good kick of flavor from the pool of Meyer lemon cream it was sitting in. 8) Bacon doughnuts - Traif's famous doughnuts! The bacon flavor was surprisingly subtle - it was basically only in the bacon bits crumbled on top of the doughnuts. The coffee ice cream on the side was the perfect complement to the doughnuts. Our server presented us with complimentary pineapple with pomegranate sauce to end our meal. Having a piece of fruit was actually a really refreshing way to end our dinner, considering how much meat we'd just consumed. Conclusion: Dinner at Traif is easily one of the best meals I've had so far in New York, and I know I would come back in a heartbeat!"	5star
Have seen reviews and shows about this place, every time in NYC we forget to go here. NEVER AGAIN! Absolutely the best, if you are looking for amazing Italian food, great prices, great atmosphere & great staff look no further! You will not be disappointed, if you are I don't know what's wrong with you.  Make sure to get reservation, if not you will be waiting a while, but it's worth it. Head to the bar have a drink and appetizer while waiting.  Nice to see a place as absolutely packed as they were and the staff composer was like there was only a couple people eating.  We are in the city 4 or so times a year for 3-4 days at a time, finally found our go to place.	5star
Honestly came here for the light-up drinks I saw on Instagram, and I was pleasantly surprised that both the drinks and food were up to par.  Tip: the restaurant opens at 6, get there at around 5:45-5:50 to avoid wait time! If you get there past 6, you're guaranteed a wait of up to an hour & a half! Also, check into Yelp for a free beer!  Their menu is tapas-style, so 2-3 dishes per person is ideal. The dishes we got were: kimchi paella, chicharron, steak, ramyun, truffle mac & cheese and the Korean pancake. 6 dishes to split amongst 4 people, and we left pretty content. My favorites were the steak and truffle mac & cheese!  As for drinks, I got the Pure Jeremy. Besides the aesthetics for Instagram/Snapchat, the drink itself has a generous amount of alcohol!  Though it was crowded, service was good and the waiters described each dish and precisely what was on it as it came out.	5star
"Just don't even try this restaurant. Precious, preening menu (""leaves and leaves, brown paper bag,"" I believe was the name of one item - a salad) that wants to be like the track list of a Bon Iver album, far too dark and dim dining room with whatever bar tender's iTunes playlist blaring in the background, and, I really mean this, nearly inedibly bad food. The amount of cumin on some side of fried potatoes we ordered will forever remain a laugh out loud joke for me and my party. The other dishes were literal slop. Cocktail list is, admittedly, mercifully decent. Still a major disappointment."	2star
I was not impressed at all.  I don't quite get the system here.  The dumplings took the longest to make and they were no longer hit by the time they called us.  Maybe we got someone else's order?  I am also not a big fan of the thick skin which apparently is northern style.   The scallion pancake was also a really big disappointment.  They were cold so definitely not fresh and also very greasy. The noodles are the saving grace but not spectacular enough to make me come back.	2star
Love the Chino-Cuban mix, very unusual blend and the food combines the best of the two worlds. Decor is also quite interesting and the service is impeccable.  We definitely are coming back here!	5star
The service here was great; we were seated right away and drinks came out within ten minutes; and then our food came out within 15 minutes of sitting down.  The food was fresh, hot, quick, and delicious. The drinks were on the sweeter side, but still very good and even worth the cocktail price.  The atmosphere is impeccable with gold leaf chandeliers coating the ceiling and intimate booths with authentic decor.	5star
I've had lobster rolls all over the northeast. If it's on the menu, there's a better chance than not that I'll order it. Basically I'm saying I've had some lobster rolls in my day and Red Hook Lobster Pound is my favorite. It's just so perfect. To be fair I know it's hard to mess up a lobster roll. It's a delicious concoction by its very nature. The traditional Maine Style Lobster Roll, which is the only one I can comment on because it's the only one I keep getting, does the simple things so right. The bun is toasted and buttery. The lobster is lightly dressed so the fresh sweet lobster is without question the lead in the play. Speaking of lobster, I know it's advertised to be a quarter pound per roll, but it feels like way more. The lobster to bun ratio feels like 19 to 1. This is one of the qualities I like most about it, to be quite honest. I've been to Luke's and that famous cliffside lobster joint in Portland, Maine and I still heavily prefer Red Hook. I really can't even resist getting it when I pass by Urbanspace. The lobster roll is the best tasting, best value because it is unapologetically stuffed with lobster, and most memorable. Plus the sides are great too. I always get, and recommend you always get, the sweet potato fries with a side of chipotle mayo. I've recommended Red Hook Lobster Pound on more occasions that I can even count. The best lobster, and best seafood in general, is not at some jacket and tie establishment somewhere in Manhattan. It's at a quirky, unpretentious joint in Brooklyn called Red Hook Lobster Pound.	5star
Great place to go just to lounge out.  I enjoyed the food and I had kept the drinks coming for all my buds.  The décor show remnants of a garage so all I thought about was getting a motor oil changed.  The feeling was definitely quaint and unique from most of the barbeque spots I've frequented.  I'll definitely be back because of it's unique interior design.  Everything is self service so just pay for the food at the cashier.    I would stop by the wholefoods afterwards for dessert.	3star
Really mediocre food for the price. Service was terrible--I literally have no idea who our server even was. Just multiple guys who seemed like bus boys asking for our order in broken English and throwing the plates on the table when ready. The bathroom was an absolute disaster--covered in trash and completely unsanitary. Will not be returning.	2star
I would do many things different if I could start all over, but I will not make the same mistakes that I did on my next visit.  SKIP the appetizers, focus on the pastas here, that is what they are known for and easily the best part of the meal ORDER the special pasta dish, don't judge it based on the description, just get it. ORDER literally anything other than the olive oil cake, or just skip dessert and eat more pasta Here is a quick ordering rundown: Appetizer: Charred octopus - delicious, I mean the best I've had and I've had charred octopus seaside in Barcelona  Pastas: The daily special - ours was a vegetarian mushroom, but doesn't matter, just get the special, it was easily the best thing we ordered The gnocchi with oxtail - this is a very heavy dish, I would save this one for a cold winters night, taste is very meaty and not at all too salty The orecchiette with sausage - to me this was the most plain plate of food we got but something about it was addictive. The little pastas are a little chewy like a mix between a gnocchi and a pasta shell The bolognese - we were too stuffed to eat this at the restaurant so we took it home, I can't give as accurate a review but this was pretty salty, a bit over in our opinion ( I'd choose different) Dessert: Olive oil cake and ice cream - I just don't get it, I just don't. After rave reviews this was just bad. The cake was so dry it was honestly like eating cardboard with sugar and olive oil - this literally almost ruined the whole experience. Wine - can't remember it all but it was outstanding	4star
"The lamb chops special was more fat and bone than meet. The Rib eye was average at best. The pork Chop was 65% bone and very tough The ""spicy"" pumpkin soup was cold and bland. $4 for bread and butter that every other place gives for free. Just a terrible experience.  Would never go back or recommend."	2star
Rude rude rude. Food is okay. Expensive I think, not sure since I lost the mood to eat after a few bites. Will not visit again.	1star
I took a 3 year hiatus from this place in the hopes that they'd get their sh*t together but alas... the food still falls short. However, the service is MUCH improved (4 stars just for service, they make mistakes but they make up for it at least!). All the dishes sound great in concept (heirloom tomato salad, chilled gazpacho with crab, steamed porgy with yuzu garlic crisps, steak crudo) but the kitchen is overreaching and falls short on execution. Everything comes out tasting a bit heavy handed and clumsy. The only items that exceeded expectations were the carrot cake and the salted caramel pudding (more like vanilla pudding scented with caramel). I shall come here no more...	2star
"NEW EDIT: LOL, dude I'm more educated than what you'll ever be. Get back to running your bar. Hopefully you'll be in business for long or maybe not. And trust me, I won't be back.... #thatisall  Ordered a cheeseburger from here to go. Specifically told the server WELL done. Got back to the office with an almost blood running burger. YUCK!! . Also, my 13 year probably makes a better Mac and cheese than this place. Total loss of my $15. HAD TO EDIT THIS REVIEW after receiving a reply from the ""owner"" to my original review and other bad reviews!  What a lack of customer service and professionalism this dude has. You can stay with your DISGUSTING bloodied burger. I could care less where you get them from but at the end of the day the customer is always right. Didn't you learn that before you opened a business? Register for some people manner courses. La Guardia Community College is around the corner. Maybe they accept you there. So sad I spent my money there."	1star
No complaints. Stopped in for a quick drink to get away from the heat. Bar area was clean and bartender was friendly and provided quality service. Would stop back to try some food. Brunch menu looked decent.	4star
Was here with a group on a weekend for brunch. We had a reservation, a must here for brunch. Everyone in the group thought the place was whatever. Overpriced average food and service. I had the Porchetta Sandwich, it was fine but no impressive.   Maybe it was just us, so give them a try and see if it tickles your pickle.	3star
I come from Southern California, the undefeated capital of mexican food in america....therefore...this was great!..but not the best I've ever had.  The interior is so cool, they have an outside patio area and a pretty nice sized bar. Weirdly easy getting a reseravation for four..we got one for 8pm on the same day..but then were able to snag a table only after waiting for 20 minutes at the bar at around 6pm.  The service was great! The guacamole was incredible... best I've had in NYC. The fish tacos were also very very good. The lamb...also amazing..the sauce was a tad spicy and not to my taste..but cooked perfectly.  Overall, I think this is genuinely a really good place for dinner, I'm a little disappointed in the menu options, nothing particularly inventive and heavy on the meat options (only a couple fish options). Keep it on your list, but I wouldn't have my birthday party here.	4star
"Really wish I could give this place 3.5 stars instead of just 3. Service: I came here on rainy Saturday at 3pm. We were seated immediately. The service was very slow and there was barely anyone there. It was enough of a wait from the time that we ordered to the time that we got our food, that we noticed and I'm usually a very patient person. In addition, the waitress didn't 100% know the menu and had a weird tone when we asked why the burger said ""caballo"" under it. Caballo means horse in Spanish, but she didn't know and made it seem as if we were crazy for asking about horse meat. Food: I ordered the choclo, which was delicious, except it was cold. It had grilled marks, but seems like they let it sit a little too long. I also ordered two empanadas, also good, but a bit greasy. They were out of micheledas as well. Overall, good food but could focus on the improving the experience a bit."	3star
i came here on a saturday for a birthday brunch. part of the reason we chose cuba was for their bottomless option. for an additional $14 you get 1.5hrs of bottomless sangria (white or red), mimosas (mango or regular), sparkling mojito, or caipirinha. for me personally these options were all on the sweet side, couldve used an addition of bloody or even beer. and they were all just ok tasting, we primarily all ended up sticking to mimosas.  the food here was tasty. my entree of lechon asado con mojo campestr was tender and full of flavor. others got the benedict with smoked salmon and some rope vieja. all were very good. the portions on the sandwiches were a bit underwhelming. in the shrimp wrap there were only a few pieces of shrimp.  reason for just 3 stars came down to the mediocre bottomless drinks and having to wait almost 30mins past our reservation time to get seated. i guess the table we were waiting for had been overserved and were not getting up. understand theres only so much the restaurant can do, but maybe monitor how much booze you are giving people?  i really liked the food and would want to come back for dinner. it was pretty rowdy during brunch.	3star
Consistently terrible service...I hate to leave two stars because I've been coming here for years and love the oysters, drinks and back garden but the staff really is consistently awful and ruins the rest of the experience. At 4pm we were kept waiting about 15-20 minutes when there were many open tables inside and outside and only about 4 customers at the bar... and when no other customers were waiting. Literally the bar itself was 2/3 empty, ALL of the indoor tables were open and 4-5 tables were available in the back garden. They're more concerned about the place looking cool to passersby than with promptly seating and serving customers actually patronizing their business. We were kept waiting for everything SO long. We had to go up to the bar to order more drinks because our server was so aloof and absent. We ordered our second course of food from a busser rather than waiting on the server again. Seriously...get it together.	2star
I decided to try this place yesterday for the first time.  The place was crowded, but we were seated almost right way.  We waited for at least 20 minutes and NO-ONE came to our table.  Really?  If you go out to eat is because you want a good service, thats why you pay for it.  We felt totally mistreated and we decided to leave the restaurant.  We told the hostess and they didn't say a word to apologize.  It will take me several months to go back to that place.  Thats too bad since the place is actually nice.	2star
It's a good restaurant if you want some decent lobster roll for a good price. Although unfortunately, they raised their prices.. It's simple and straight to the point just like the name of the restaurant. You can either order a burger or lobster. You also have the option of choosing both for $33 if you have the apetite for it. All meals come with a generous amount of French fries, and and a small size of salad. I always order the original lobster roll and it never disappoints. Every time I go, the taste and quality has always been consistent. The bread itself is verr buttery and goes really well with the meat. There's a generous amount of lobster and with the sides of fries and salad, paying $20-25 is pretty worth it. The best part about it is the minimum wait. Since there's limited food options, I'm assuming kitchen moves pretty quickly so after about 5-10 minutes of ordering, our food was ready! YES! No waiting for another hour! However, the restaurant does tend to get crowded for dinner time so come early to beat the crowd, especially if you have a big party. It's a spacious restaurant with lots of seating, so  consider this place if you have a big party gathering.	4star
Came here on a whim after an early dinner. I ended up getting a white guy and I could finally confirm that the hype was real. I was planing to get the pizza to go but once I picked up my order I couldn't wait but to chow down a slice while it was still hot. The dough was light and flavorful. You heard it right, that dough tasted very garlicky and I never had that kind of dough elsewhere. The ricotta cheese was rich and went well with that dough. Overall, a very satisfying pie. I took off one star because it was a lot more oily than a normally pie and it was kinda messy to eat on the go.	4star
This place has definitely evolved over the years. It has become one of my favorite places for chicken and biscuits. The chicken is flavorful and the biscuits a late always fresh and flaky. I always have to get me a biscuit with sour cherry jam. It is awesome! Also make sure you save room for some pie and donuts. They are made fresh and they are super delicious! This place is on my top 5 list!	5star
Ehh... Stopped in here because the chalkboard on the sidewalk said happy hour. We went inside and the bar stools are the most uncomfortable chairs I've ever sat on. Then it turns out that happy hour was only Monday thru Friday, even though it was Saturday & they were advertising happy hour.	2star
Great music and good vibes at this unique spot. I had the red curry noodles and 'stinky pete' cocktail for brunch. All of the other dishes looked fantastic. Will definitely be back!	4star
It was a gloomy Sunday afternoon and we were hoping that the weather would discourage people from coming out. We were wrong! There was a line out the door and people seemed more than willing to stand out in the rain. Normally we would just give up and leave. But it was quite early in the day and neither one of us was starving. We decided to see how long the wait would be. While the waitress warned us the wait could be as long as an hour we were seated shortly, probably within 15 minutes.  Now, like most restaurants they try to maximize real estate and force as many tables and chairs in together as possible. But southern comfort doesn't mean hovering on top of the person seated at the table next to you.  Our waiter was quick to greet us and take our order. Not much of a conversationalist but that's fine. We opted for a side of macaroni and cheese and for entrees we went with the Crab Benedict and chicken and waffles.  Within 6 minutes (I timed it), our food was served. 6 minutes is absurdly fast. Either the food was sitting there or they just simply cook everything before hand and they simply pop it into the microwave.  Honestly I was never able to get over this fact and didn't find myself enjoying my meal. Also, when my girlfriend requested for ketchup, they brought out ketchup packets.  I probably would give this place anther change but not anytime soon.	3star
Alright I had some hope for this place. I was let down. I will make the review simple. Hipster+Italian food= the sosta. Menu is limited and not to flavorful. Bucatini weak, spaghetti weak. Not sure I will go back. Maybe I'll try the meat pasta but otherwise it's a lame spot with lame pasta. Don't come to little Italy with junk. Oh why two stars? It's decorated nice.	2star
We had brunch here on Sunday and it was just okay. First, I will say that the service is very good. As for the food, the food was just okay. There are better places for brunch in that area. However, our biggest issue is the amount of food that you get. I ordered the French onion soup and French toast and my wife got eggs, and the portions were tiny. My French toast was literally 2 tiny pieces of toast with probably 3 cut up strawberries. Needless to say, after we left, we were hungry again within 30 minutes and stopped elsewhere for a snack. Maybe we just got the wrong dishes, but we were not impressed.	3star
I used to love this restaurant. However, on my last visit this past Friday (the night before Christmas Eve) I went for dinner and my boyfriend and I ended up with food poisoning on Christmas Eve. I got sick 5 times and still was feeling ill on Christmas. I know it was the steak from St. Anselm because it was the only meal I shared with my boyfriend that day. I called the restaurant to let them know; they said a manager would contact me but then never got back to me. I will never go to St. Anselm again.	1star
"Almost ""walked away"" because there was no table for us. But, while standing outside on Park looking through Yelp to find an alternative, manager Mike M. came outside to bring us back in! Glad he did, because food was fantastic. Great fun. Business associate and I ordered a series of starter dishes to share. All of them were great. Standouts were: Artichoke dip with pita and the Pepperoni flat bread."	4star
Small restaurant, but full of energy and ambiance. Food and service was outstanding.  We ordered the pad Thai shrimp and the pad see ew. Both had nice flavor and tasted very fresh.  Prices are great for being in NYC. Will definitely come back.	5star
Excellent food and service. The music here are all hip hop. Just my type of jams. The main course I had a lb of shrimp, inspired me to cook more.	4star
Super friendly staff, very attentive and personable. The reason I give them 2 stars is because I am Confused about the $20 price tag on the chimichanga/burrito (and most of the menu). It was good, but I was expecting blow my mind delicious OR super gigante (giant). It was neither.  The rice and beans were barely warmer than the room, the burrito was average sized and only contained meat and cheese.  Overall very sub-par. My party of five left confused and taken advantage of. Why 4 stars and why so expensive? Mamacita you were so nice I am apprehensive of your character...	2star
"On 3/24/17 at approximately 1930 hours (sorry im military), my black GF and I (brown Hispanic) enter this place to have a drink because it looks interesting. Upon entering we find seats across from the bar and have a drink. I ask to see the menu and was interested in ordering some ham as an appetizer. $9 for one type and $32 for another type. I express interest in ordering some ham and ask for a small sliver of the more expensive one to see if the additional curing was worth the price. I was told ""no"" in a very condescending tone as if I could not afford it. I could afford it but am or was a little out off that the waiter would not offer a sample and just said trust me you will like it. If your white come here. I'm sure you will get a free sample before you buy. Spaniards are very racist and stereotyping of Puerto Rican Cubans with dark skin. Food and ham did look good though.  Garcia"	1star
My absolute favorite Thai place in the city. Service is always quick, very tasty food. I enjoy trying new dishes every time I go although I can't do without having their pad see ew. Their pad see ew and pad Thai are the best I've ever had in the US. Perfect amount of salt and sugar, not too greasy but not dry either. The ambiance is unique and perfect for a date or celebration or friend catch up. I've been here four times already and had a great time. Their specialty dishes are at least as good as the classics.  Their tapioca dumplings are also to die for. Unbelievably delicious! Please go to this place, I promise you you will fall in love with it :)	5star
Food is delicious, don't miss this place it's GREAT!	5star
The Singapore shrimp noodle does not look anything close to the pictures online.when u take out delivery actually count extra small shrimp 5.	2star
"I love Riko especially after a great workout, you get a lots of food with a cheap price. I came here twice ordering the individual combo with half chicken, rice and beans. You can't really go wrong with the chicken. With the price of 9 dollars, it's really worth it. I can't finish the whole combo and I always have to split into half. The second time I came here with a friend, we ordered a side of tostones. The tostones was really hot when it served and that's the way I like it. The first time I came here, the restaurant was almost empty and I got my food in less than 5 minutes. The second time I came here, the restaurant was full!! My friend was shocked because she came here quite often and never have to wait. It was a Monday night after 8.30pm. We waited 5 minutes for our table. I took off a star because the service was way too slow. They do not have enough staff for the entire restaurant. The menu wrote ""substitute any sides with additional $0.75"". My friend wanted to substitutes fries but they say they couldn't do it but she had ordered the same combo everytime. Maybe they are just way too busy. I don't know. We had to ask for the green sauce. The table behind us came later and hasn't order yet got the sauce and the fried corn but not us. Was quite disappointing. However, due to their price and food. I will return again. Maybe get it to go."	3star
Hands down one of my favorite places to eat in China town in Manhattan.  If you love cheap, delicious and no frills then this place is for you.  All the noodle dishes on them menu range from $6-7.  You can also get their 8 delicious dumplings fried or steamed for $3!  Keep in mind, they hand make all of their noodles and the dumplings for this cheap! Here is my go to order, you really can't go wrong: 1. I get number 11, the Zha Jiang Mian (black bean and meat sauce with noodles and vegetables). ($6) 2. One order of the fried dumplings ($3) 3. One bottle water ($1) Once you place your order, you can expect your food to arrive in 5 minutes or less.  Once you are done eating, flag the lady and it is cash only, so don't expect to pay using a credit card.  Enjoy!	5star
The food was fine (wonton mein), but not enough to overshadow the crappy experience I had when paying the bill. The lady who closed the bill for us blatantly asked for more tips; it felt pretty rude and I left pretty upset...	2star
Amali is another example of over-hyped eateries in NYC.  I live a few blocks from Amali so a few weeks ago on a Friday we decided to go there for date night.   The decor was quite cute though once I attempted to sit down at a seat against the wall, the reddish cloth looked so dingy that I immediately got a cringing sensation.  I didn't want to be difficult so I just let it go and sat down. We got the menu and it was quite short.  I figured they were good at what they did so I was excited for our food.  We ordered a salad that I don't remember the name of and a whole fish along with some sides.  I have never had such a bad salad in my life before.  It was just awful.  It was mildly seasoned with salt, pepper, oil and maybe some dressing (not sure if there was because I didn't taste any though there was supposed to be some sort of dressing) and it just didn't taste like anything at all that my husband stopped having it after one bite.  I convinced myself that it's good for me and I ate about half the salad. The fish was average without any imagination.   I'm shocked by the good reviews of this place.	2star
"After coming back here two more times I wasn't as impressed: Pros: 1) Live jazz still there 2) Loungey/chill atmosphere very relaxing...to the point I wanted to sleep 3) You can still buy an overpriced bottle of your choice and leave it in one of their cubbies, so the next time you return they'll pour you a drink from the same bottle (like your own little ""mini-bar"") Cons: 1) Portions were so small this time, not sure if they saw my review and said damn we're giving away too much food 2) Expensive for such little food $60+ per person for a party of 3, 20% tip, tax, and only 2 appetizers and 3 entrees and 1 dessert 3) The AC was set to sub-zero...they wanted to fatality me 4) The lighting was so dim, we had to use our iphone flashlights to see each other across the table Not as impressed as I was the first time"	3star
Food was all bland and flavorless for the most part. Eggplant po'boy had no seasoning on it -- good concept, bad execution. Really crappy quality bread too. Not worth the carbs. They have a menu of loaded fries that sounds promising but fails to deliver on so many levels. The sauce on the Mexican style one was flavorless, and the fries themselves look crispy but are actually kind of soft. Not quite soggy though.  Service was pretty bad. It was super slow when we got in, took forever to get our food, had to flag down the server anytime we needed something. She also wasn't very knowledgeable about food or drinks.	2star
"Given there is no shortage of quality pizzerias in NYC it may seem absurd to wait in line for one - but honestly, Juliana's is well worth it.  We went around 4pm on a Saturday and the line was beyond the cordons they have set up. In the end we waited about 45 mins, which is not that bad (when you compare to say waiting 2hrs for a milkshake at Black Tap or the Dumbo ride at Disney...). It's well organised and they check the party sizes in the line so that they can arrange the tables accordingly.  Once seated it's relatively cosy but not to the point where other tables are interfering with your enjoyment. The walls (or at least the one I was looking at) are covered in pictures of Sinatra.  You have a choice of classic pizzas that you can add extra toppings or their specialties, to which you can make no changes. We went for a Margherita with pepperoni (wife's pick) plus the No. 1 special (a white pizza with mozzarella, scamorza affumicata and pancetta). Both were great but the special was the stand out dish - so good - best pizza I've had. Didn't have specs for one of their ""sweets"" as we had two larges and I was stuffed - but I had the Brookie bridge (ice cream sandwich with brownies) a couple of years ago and if i remember correctly it was great.  Gotta shout out to our waiter Trimell - not just for being a great waiter, but also while we were waiting in line he ran after a customer that had left their card behind"	5star
This was my first time here, and I really like fresh seafood. We had a shrimp roll and a crab roll. I wasn't a fan of the crab roll, because I wish it was more seasoned. I liked the shrimp roll better because it had more flavor. The clam chowder was really good and the coleslaw was decent. I'm not sure that I would come back here, but it was decent food if you're looking for quick bite to eat!	3star
i could not comprehend how this spot had such great reviews we opted for a variety of their most popular items but they were either over-sauced or just bad (the squid ink pasta) we both agreed the ribs were the best but otherwise, it was sadly all hype	2star
This resturaunt needs to get its act back together. I've been here many times before and I don't know what happened. The food was bland and the portions were very small. They tried to be fancy with the chicken parmigiana by making it with fresh mozzarella- they should have just left it the way it is usually made. Besides the food, the view is very nice and the resturant is very clean. Service wasn't that great. I didn't really appreciate the fact that the waiter made a face when we said we only wanted water to drink. Also didn't appreciate the high prices for what we ate and the taste of the food. Even though the food wasn't very good I will probably be back just hoping that was an off night.	2star
Amy Ruth's is one of Harlem's gems. My wife, kids and I met up with a friend and his kids for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. The patrons were a diverse representation of what you would expect in NYC. It was great to see. The line was incredibly long, but it was worth the wait. Shortly after being seated, we had cornbread brought to our table. The cornbread was delicious. It was moist and cake-like, but not over the top sweet.  Mostly everyone ordered some type of waffle entree. You can't come to Amy Ruth's and not order waffles. My son ordered a cheeseburger. I still love him so I'll let it slide. His cheeseburger was massive. I ordered the Jennifer Holliday, which is waffles with fried shrimp. I truly do think they make the best waffles in NYC, maybe even the East coast. The waffles had a little crisp on the outside, but was nice and soft on the inside. It was just right. The shrimp was seasoned to perfection and was a perfect blend with the waffles. We ordered two sides of baked mac and cheese for the table. They were amazing. It has just the right amount of cheese and it just seemed to melt in your mouth. The wings were great as well. My friend's son ordered the Reggie Harris, which is southern honey-dipped fried chicken. I didn't get to try it, but he loved it. It looked sticky and sweet.  We all enjoyed our meals, which is a testament to the food at Amy Ruth's. I don't give five stars very often, but when a place warms my heart and leaves me wanting more just thinking about it, I've been won over and they're definitely doing something right.	5star
"too bad i can't give this place 0 stars, or even negative. and all because of the ridiculously terrible service. the food wasn't that good to forget about the service either.  my friend had her birthday here, table of 6, but a friend and i were late. was not greeted warmly. we came with our own cake. we asked if they could hold it until it was time for dessert. the waitress, with no emotion, told us it cost $25 to cut the cake. we asked total right? for all 6 of us. she said no per person. E X C U S E M E? $25 PER PERSON to cut a damn cake?! (i told my dad, who worked at a fancy restaurant, and he said that is UNHEARD of.) so we just took the cake with us and would cut later ourselves because there's no way in hell we'd give $25 pp for them to cut a cake into six slices.  we had the set menu. the food was alright.  after we finished the dishes, we were waiting for some time because we were expecting our dessert to come out. since i mean we did order the set menu which should come with dessert. so after waiting ~20 minutes, we decided to ask our rude waitress where our dessert was. with no emotion, she said ""oh the kitchen's closed."" we were like.. doesn't the set menu come with dessert? she walked away and came back shortly and said ok we'll give you guys a plate of churros. uhm you are SUPPOSED to give us churros because we ordered THE SET MENU. she acted as if she was doing us a favor for something that we paid for. when she brought out the one plate of churros, she went to bring us plates. my friend said we don't need any. she said 'okay' with SO much attitude.  unfortunately tip was included because we had 6 people because we wouldn't have tipped. this girl did not deserve ANY money from us from the disgusting service we received. the restaurant was empty. there was no one else she had to attend to. it was only 9:30 and the restaurant was supposed to close at 11:30, so i don't see what her problem was. i went to tell my dad about this horrendous experience he said and he said if he was there he wouldn't have even paid for the meal AT ALL let alone tip her.  *FYI* on the check her name said : Parker G never coming back here again."	1star
Really good! The eggplant and tofu dish was great and the duck noodle dish was also a standout. The vegetable spring rolls are homemade and tasty. The decor is lovely and the staff is attentive.	4star
I would never think to go to brooklyn heights for soup dumplings, but since I'm in the area for jury duty, I had to try it out because of its good reviews! This spot turned shanghai food into fast food which is pretty perfect. The regular pork soup dumplings were really good. It's $5 for 4 soup dumplings and while that doesn't compare well to chinatown prices, it's the perfect price and portion for 1 person. I also ordered the pork and bok choy wonton soup. It was light, but the broth was a little too salty for my taste. I wasn't that big of a fan. It was also $5 for a small portion, but once again- good for one. The bad part about this place is the service. The girl at the cash register today (Tuesday 4/11/2017 at around 12:45pm) looked super miserable like she hated life. She also took down my order wrong so I had to go back and pay a little extra and wait really long while she figured out how to work the computer to charge me for the right item. Not really an enjoyable experience. I wouldn't direct people to this place if they're wanting the best soup dumplings in NYC, but it is good if you work in the area and want something other than pizza or chinese takeout. It's an interesting gimmick with pretty good food.	3star
We were asked what time we had to leave, do you have theater plans. We said yes at 7:30 so we'd like to be out by 7:15. They asked us! I looked at my phone and it was 7:23. I panicked. I was furious. They were supposed to take care of this. So we didn't get our ordered and paid for dessert. This is unacceptable at a four star restaurant.	1star
As a first time patron at the iconic Red Rooster Harlem, I was very disappointed with the level of professionalism and customer service by the security team.  While sitting at the bar, a fight broke out between two men. Security immediately came to rectify the situation between the guests who were in an arguement. However, one thing led to another and before you know it, three security guards were dragging a man sweeping him through the whole restaurant out the door.  Not only was this situation poorly handled by security, but it also put the patrons in danger. Someone could have gotten injured. This really put a bad taste in my mouth, as I had very high expectations for Red Rooster. Very disappointing. In terms of the food, we only ordered drinks and an appetizer (we went during late hours). I must say the deviled eggs were very delicious!	1star
Worst service I've ever received especially giving the area. Waited 40 mins for a salad. Got up and walked out. Horrible	1star
I was very impressed by the entire experience and particularly inspired by the honest and professional demeanor of our server named Steven.  He stayed with our needs and wants and was only extraordinarily patient with my elderly parent who was not sure what was going to get given dietary restrictions and other considerations.   Given Steven's fine human approach and genuine caring I will be going back with more frequency.  Wild lobsters from Canada, need I say more.  I do not need chlorine laden beasts that have little flavor and a great deal of harmful chemicals.  I also forgot to add that the last time I had a grilled lobster was when I visited Joe's Stone Crab restaurant in Miami Beach, Florida.  I personally do not know other places in the city that give you that option.  Great job!	5star
We dropped in for brunch today on a whim - having only been to Sweet Afton for dinner and drinks, we were excited to try out the brunch menu. Now, I usually love Sweet Afton, but we were really bummed out at how poor the food was on the brunch menu - from the limited selection to the disappointing plates we received at our table.  I got the fried chicken biscuit + gravy, and my boyfriend got the Chorizo hash. The chicken was fine, though not very large, the biscuit dry, and the gravy just so-so. My boyfriend's hash wasn't fully cooked through, and there was nothing crisp or spicy about the sautéed peppers, onion, or chorizo. Neither plate had much flavor. I On top of that we had two coffees and two cocktails - beware the super small mimosas (@ $8) - and the total bill came to $51, pre-tip.  Our server was friendly, and the service not bad, but we were just wildly disappointed with the overall experience. I'll be back for drinks and dinner, but will definitely pass on brunch. If your price point is near Burnside Biscuits and Sugar Freak, you'd better deliver food at that level; those places warrant a wait at brunch. Sadly, that wasn't the case today at Sweet Afton. Pass. I'd definitely recommend brunch elsewhere on 30th Ave. :(	2star
Nice place.  Decor is opulent, exotic, but kind of modern, gold + dark wood everything.  Food plating is also visually impressive overall.  Fun upscale Thai experience. Food is good.  I keep ordering their royal pad Thai which is a fancily decorated version of normal pad Thai wrapped in a net made from fried egg, on top of a giant leaf, and big prawns on top.  Appetizers were really good too.  (They always gave us a complimentary one to whet the appetite, piece of pineapple with a meatball or something on a toothpick.). The seafood curry in a coconut shell was just ok, a little too rich (but I'm not a huge fan of Thai curry so could just be me). I liked their lemongrass juice and pandan juice.  Both are light and fragrant, come unsweetened with syrup on the side.  Go very well with the food. Service - depends on the day..  in the times I've visited, have ranged from amazing (super attentive, luxury hotel-quality waiters, replaced a dropped utensil almost as quickly as I noticed, waitress crouched to table level to speak, great recommendations, etc) to downright hostile (super understaffed, waitress barely tried to hide annoyance when asked any question - to the point our party was a little afraid to interact with her.. to my embarrassment since I recommended the place for its good service in the past; forgot one of the dishes, not helpful with menu, etc).  Chalking it to a one off for now... Make sure to reserve ahead of time if possible.  Last time I went they ran out of resies for the day and our group waited in the front for like an hour.	4star
"Just like the legendary show Review, I can't give this no stars. However, tonight definitely warrants that. Upon ordering the sausage roll it came ""garnished"" with an uncooked, skewered whole heart shaped potato with the words ""Roy y Eduardo""  added in amateur Sharpie.  The tasteless gay joke (though the dish was stricken from the bill) did little to to leave me wanting more, ever."	1star
Have to pay for chips and salsa. The service was slow, and even getting our margaritas room a long time. The food was just ok.	2star
"Two stars for decor. Atmosphere is really nice. Very well done. Service is fine. Staff pleasant. A few good beers on the menu.  HOWEVER: $16 for a burger and they serve it with frozen fries.  Despite knowing they were frozen simply by looking at them, I bit into one anyway and had flashbacks of crazy nights sitting on the living room floor watching Different Strokes (when it originally aired, even). There are fast, casual dining restaurants that do not serve anything frozen. I cannot imagine why this joint would.  The burger was also not great. Cooked fine but weirdly sweet and the bun was almost stale. I'll take the hit for not knowing the ""signature sauce"" was a sweet one as I did not ask, but still.   I don't expect to be wowed by a $16 meal in LIC but this was just legit inadequate and unsatisfying."	2star
We had a 20+ minute wait around 7 pm on a Thursday. Once inside, we discovered the space was deceptively large-- bilevel with a dramatic view. The decor is much cooler than what their online presence would suggest. Acoustics are pretty bad, crowd was a little touristy. Drink list looks standard for Midtown, with sangria and mojitos. The food list tends towards large rice and meat plates. My friend and I both had the shrimp. They were plump and cooked well, but nothing that special. The sauce on it was slightly cheesy, which I didn't love. Potatoes were good. Portion was huge, so the price ($18?) wasn't bad. Food came out quick but service was absent when we wanted to leave. This is one of those standard large-plate South American spots that I keep finding myself in at Midtown. It's done competently, but you leave stuffed and not overly impressed.	3star
"Have you ever read ""The Emperor's New Clothes""???? Maybe people can not admit that this place is insane, it is not a restaurant that serves food, just an idea that they do, hence the story. Atmosphere was nice, food not so great or not existent!!!!!! the crawfish chips were like pork rinds with old bay seasoning,and there were 6 chips in the order. We tried all of the small plates, only the cauliflower was decent. Mains were so small and unsatisfying, pasta dish wasn't pasta but a raw, spiralized root with sauce. everyone was disappointed. The scallops were shark tips and not scallops at all.  not worth the $400 tab. There was no food!!!!!! just remnants of what we thought food was. The food was very strange, we all left starving also. Dessert was good, we had apple donuts."	1star
I have never been to a restaurant that tells you that you can't have an appetizer before your meal?  The waitress kept telling us that the restaurant is so full and therefore we would not be able to get appetizers before our meal.  (The restaurant was empty.) We had a dinner set up for 10 female doctors to get to know one another.  Was meant to me a fun night. We  had to leave because of the service and their inability to be accommodating.  Found a wonderful restaurant around the corner.  But overall very dissatisfied with the service.  The restaurant is otherwise beautiful.	1star
I've been to la vara many times, and really liked this place. I went back again looking forward to it, knowing that it will probably be a good experience. It wasn't. To be fair, the drinks were good and the staff nice, yet not engaging. I am writing this review for the owner/chef who I know is amazing and probably isn't there as much to pay attention for small details in the kitchen which have made the food go downhill. After ordering, we were presented with a small amuse bouche of carrot juice and cumin in a sherry glass. This alone started the meal off poorly, the opposite of the amuse point. It was flavorless and cold. We wish it just didn't come out at all. We started with the fried eggplant with honey and cheese which was one of my favorites previously. There was too much cheese, the eggplant was not crispy and not sweet enough. The chicken hearts were good but it was a very small bite more of a snack than an appetizer and not worth $13. The migas (also one we raved about in past visits) had too much paprika and not enough grapes; it was not exciting. The croquettes of the day which were described as Serrano ham were actually some bland potato/cheese fried mush.. Not distinguishable and definitely no ham involved. The last dish, Lingua special was the worst of all. Arrived after 45 min sitting and wasn't sure it was even the right cut. It tasted like regular beef and was very chewy. The carrots were undercooked as well. Also small for the price, $18 for a tiny stew.  We really like this place in the neighborhood and this review is not to put la vara down but as a push to make it better and like how it was before.	2star
Great vibe and whiskey selection! Ciera is great, come see her- she's in Tuesday thru Saturday.	4star
I came here on a Monday afternoon 5pm, travelled all the way from uptown and when I showed up they were closed, chairs up and dark inside. It's says both on their website and Yelp that they are opened and there was no sign or explanation on the door to explain why. VERY disappointed Union, I'd like to thank Boqueria for being close by and OPEN, I'm enjoying happy hour thoroughly, get it together or go home Union	1star
I was really disappointed here, I'm sorry to say. There's few things that I ever leave less than 3 stars but cleanliness is one of them. We came right when the place opened for brunch on a Saturday after reading great things. The first table we were placed at, next to the windows in front, smelled like old seafood. I get it, seafood restaurants smell a little salty, but this was gross. I looked over on the windowsill to find pieces of old crab meat littering the sill, plus caked on grime and some hair. It had obviously not been cleaned in weeks and makes me wonder what else in the place is being overlooked.  We moved tables and ordered breakfast which was tasty. The crab cake was excellent, but I was disappointed in the lox and whitefish platter. The lox had obviously just been removed from a package and placed on the plate. I'm sure the other food is pretty good but I was already grossed out from the place being dirty. I won't be trying it again.	2star
This review is long over due. I was here two weeks ago when the temperature dropped to the lowest point this winter. But the hospitality and the warm sake at Benemon warmed me up :) In case you are curious if is not related to Wasan, another fav izakaya of mine next door. I came in right after they opened on Sat so was fairly quiet. But it fell up by the time I left around 8. So do make a reservation.  Decoration was warm industrial , think big Edison light balls hanging off the ceiling and wood benches. Perfect for a date or friends catch up. I was sitting at the bar. Promptly i was served the warm sake of choice and chatted up with the friendly bar tender. Since I was not super hungry so I opted for two smaller plates - tuna tataki and the soba salad . Both were good tho not necessary memorable. Have to give bonus star for the proper portion; perfect portion for share or solo. The tuna was lightly seared with a hint of smoke . The Cajun miso dressing delivered a mild spicy hit.light and umami-ny.  The soba salad served along avocado and veggies in light soya dressing was refreshing. Prob better in summer but not a bottom-freezing cold winter day. Service was friendly and sufficient. Will stop by again when I am near the hood.	4star
I'm from Texas I know tacos and I Love this place for a quick bite. Tacos were amazing!!! Guacamole fresh, drinks were cold, service was quick, restaurant was clean. Loved it so much we went twice!	5star
Awesome lobster rolls, whole claws and chunks of tail. They're lightly dressed so that it really highlights the lobster. I always trended towards less is more when it comes to real quality ingredients. Hiding it in mayo, butter, and salt is totally a trick to hide things going bad. But Luke's Lobster has superb quality ingredients. It was so so delicious that I'm already craving another one. We got one as a snack while my mom and I were walking around Manhattan after a week of dreary weather, the sun finally broke through and we wanted to take advantage of it. This was the perfect snack!	5star
This is the most decent Ramen place in the FIDI area and I come here quiet often for lunch.  However, today I did not have a good experience.  Usually I always ask for two hot sauces since they come in tiny containers and no one has ever gave me an issue about it.  Today, the girl gives me one and tells me its one per order.  Really?!? Not going back, and no I don't want to buy the big bottle of hot sauce that you sell.	3star
Very expensive for a small amount of kind of bland food. The atmosphere was cute but I had to wait a long time despite being one of the only people in the shop. My stomach did not feel great that evening, could have been something else but I don't think I'll go back.	2star
Went here for dinner last night.  Nice ambiance and layout. Arrived 10 minutes early for reservation and we were seated immediately.  They do a 3 course price fixe menu which was a pretty good deal.   Food: Pork bolognese: fresh pasta,  perfectly al dente,  rich hearty sauce.  Finely chopped carrots gave it a great crunch. A- Seafood stew: decent,  but somewhat bland and lacking significant substance.  My least favorite entree. C Pork loin and belly: loin perfectly cooked and belly tasted like candy. B+ Striped bass: great portion,  seasoned perfectly,  seared for a great crust,  yet perfectly delicate middle.  My favorite entree.  A Strawberry dessert: fresh strawberries,  whipped cheesecake,  and flavored ice. Flavors were all fresh and bright.  Whipped cheesecake was light and delicious.   Overall, decent dinner,  great service. Not sure that I would go back.  Reservations are advised,  it was very crowded.	3star
Good selection of both hot and cold soba noodles. I tried the Kamo Nanbon, hot soba with slices of duck in clear broth. I found the noodles were a little soggy and broken and the flavor of the broth a little weak. Good atmosphere for dinner and drinks, but lacking in quality of soba, which is what they are known for!	3star
Okay, this place is really more of a 3.5. It was good but I wasn't overwhelmed and I didn't entirely get all the hype. The atmosphere is cool and the service was awesome. The server was incredibly helpful with giving recommendations. We got the squash toast which was a seasonal item. I thought that it was good and all of the flavors on it went together nicely. The mushroom pizza was good as well but fairly simple. The angel hair pasta was under he helming - it was somewhat dry and lacking in flavor. Overall, I liked ABC kitchen but I didn't LOVE it like I wanted to considering all the hype.	3star
The service was exceptional and they were very attentive. Felt like a great place to destress and enjoy end of week gathering. The bartender was an all around great guy and catered to us first hand while we sat outside. We had a prime table and enjoyed the tapas tacos, skirt steak skewers and plantain dish. Honestly I would highly recommend to anyone wanting to enjoy a night of fun.	5star
If you want a waiter who ignores you, a maitre d who spills water on your guests and table (not once but twice), overall poor service with below average food, you've come to the right place.  We decided to eat here before the marathon and it was the worst experience ever. The waiter was rude and rolled his eyes when we expressed our concerns. We had to beg for water the whole meal. The lasagna I ordered was burnt and lacked flavor. I will never come back here! On the plus side, their pizza was actually pretty good.	1star
The Korean bowl bbq short rib is not authentic, few pieces of over seasoned meat, the grilled chicken taco is not flavorful as expected. The kimchi fried rice is not even fried, instead it is boiled and mixed with kimchi. Very disappointed meal. Will not recommend anyone to try it.	2star
Such a cute spot, great food but terrible service. Our server only gave us one menu between 4 of us and we waited a considerable length of time for him to take our orders. The rest of the party had got there earlier and already had drinks so I ordered a glass of wine with my food. When the food came I had to ask again for the wine, no apology. Slow service in between courses taking away our plates. Before dessert our wine glasses were take away without being asked if we cared for more. After around 15mins we had to ask for the dessert menu which took a further 10mins to arrive and then another 10mins for us to get the servers attention to order. Such a shame as aside from the terrible service everything else was great. We went on a Sunday night, although it was busy at times there were several empty tables around us so either the place is understaffed or the servers need more training.	3star
I went here for brunch on a Sunday early afternoon, and it was amazing. Had the breakfast sandwich (made with cheddar waffles, fried chicken, fried egg, and bacon! Decadent and delicious) and two sangrias, which CANNOT be underestimated. Truly delicious, a shame they don't do pitchers of it.  I'd love to come back for dinner or drinks sometime. A little pricey, but standard for the neighborhood. Good work, Uglyduckling.	5star
Definitely a cute Sunday brunch spot! Love the modern feel of it and the servers with the French accents! Definitely a plus lol! Started off with the wine and cheese platter which was to die for then moved on the the steak and eggs and a burger! Steaks were cooked very well, super juicy but slightly bloody for my liking. Eggs were beautifully runny for dipping. My burger were also cooked to perfection and definitely inhaled every last bite. Next time I will definitely be going back to try a few of their delicious looking drinks and a few different items on the menu. Decent size but smaller groups are probably more ideal. Friendly staff who are quick to wait on your hungry needs! Would definitely recommend this place.	4star
Hands down one of mine and the boy's favorite places to frequent. We actually accidentally stumbled upon this place and have just kept coming back. I've been here for lunch, dinner and drinks. The bruschette are really delicious (my favorite is the ricotta with honey and truffle oil) and they haven't missed with any of the pasta dishes I've had. The cocktails are also great, my favorite being the Italian Sour (a twist on a whiskey sour). I also love the decor: simple with wood and metal elements. On top of these positives, a huge reason we keep going back is the service! From the door to the table, it's professional, friendly and welcoming. We've usually opted for sitting at the bar. The bartender (Dani? We're both terrible with names and keep forgetting! Or maybe it's the delicious drinks haha) is awesome. She is super sweet, attentive and makes awesome drinks. We also came for NYE, which was fun in itself. There was a buffet of mouthwatering bites, unlimited drinks and was just a really fun crowd. Personally I feel like this is a place for dates or girls night out but I have seen families here as well.  The only gripe I have is that it is a cash only establishment. And also that it seems to have gotten more popular/crowded since I first started coming here (but now that's just me being selfish lol).	5star
Terrific cocktails! This bar is very close to our garage in the city so I come here for a drink whenever I need to kill time waiting for my fiance. I've found the quality of the cocktails to be above what I initially expected and my favorite drink so far is their take on the Grey Garden cocktail. Earl grey infused gin, Saint Germain, lemon juice and Angostura. So good!	4star
I was disappointed by my meal at Beso.  Given the other reviews, I was expecting an excellent dinner and great evening.  But it really fell short. First of all, the hostess is at best, unpleasant - at worst, somewhat hostile.  Not the friendly face you want to see when you walk in. Second, the server was basically pleasant but only appeared about 4 times in 3 hours.  No one brought us water until we requested it about halfway through the meal, and then they were rarely (if ever) refilled.   The food was also disappointing - we had about 5 of the tapas and I can't even remember everything we ate (and it was last night) except for the shrimp wrapped in a plantain, which was very starchy and tasteless.  Chips and guac were pretty good, although a little greasy.  The calamari were average. The paella was the only remarkable (in a good way) dish - rice was moist, almost creamy, and flavorful, and there was lots of seafood.  The other entree we had (chicken) was bland.  The white sangria was very good and the bartender was nice.   Overall it was disappointing and I would not go back.	2star
I'll be honest, I was going in expecting to be blown away and I wasn't. I've had this place bookmarked for a while due to the popularity of their oyster happy hour and their overwhelmingly positive reviews on Yelp. I think the biggest issue I had was the seafood wasn't really the star of the show, it seemed like there was too much going on in the way of the seafood, it also didn't help that the seafood couldn't stand on it's own. I was expecting more of a pronounced seafood flavor, I think really great seafood doesn't really need much to make it fantastic except freshness. Also, the restaurant is minuscule and the waits can be painful.  The food: Oysters- Overall, I think I prefer West Coast, they are usually higher in salinity and flavor. Kumamoto from Washington State are excellent as they should be, Kumamotos are prob my all time fav oysters. Shigoku Samish Bay from Washington were good as well but a tad too salty for me. Katama Martha's Vineyard, I didn't really care for these, they looked like deflated oysters and they had very little taste.  Burrata Salad- Fresh Italian cheese made from mozzarella and cream with rocket arugula and balsamic reduction. This is a safe dish but still a good one, the burrata was nice, it had a nice creamy texture and a very pleasant mozzarella flavor. The arugula with balsamic was a nice way to tie everything together, only thing I didn't care for was the stale bread. Fettuccine with clams- Al dente tossed lightly with parmesan & olive oil. I think Italians around the world would have a heart attack, the idea of cheese and seafood... lol I thought this was a good dish, there were a ton of clams and the flavor of the clams were great. The noodles had a great chew and the sauce was very garlicky and very cheesy but it was on the greasy side. I did like this dish and it is one of their more popular dishes but I think this is a dish you share, it is kinda too heavy for one persons.  Cioppino- Fish of the day, scallops, head on shrimp, clams and mussels in a red wine tomato broth. So this a very San Francisco dish and the one here was alright. The broth was nice, it was so light but had such a nice essence of the sea and a little sweetness from the tomato. The fish was just OK, it didn't offer a lot of flavor and it was overcooked. The head on shrimp and mussels were just OK as well, they were both meaty but lacked flavor like the broth didn't cook into the seafood. Kinda tasted like they boiled the seafood and the broth separately. There was also a ton of sliced onions which added a touch of flavor.  Beer Steamed Mussels- 1lb of Maine mussels steamed in beer, served with toast points. I was super excited to try this dish but it was kind of a let down. The mussels were so plump and meaty but sadly they lacked flavor. The mussels did have a ton of onions as well which went nice.	3star
1st time here and it was my dates pick.. First impressions: the space is really nice/cool, bartenders and staff were pleasant and laid back, loved the open kitchen concept and the aesthetic. it was very hot Wednesday and they didn't have A/C pumping good enough and the fans were on a slow crawl lol.  Food: they have these specials on the chalkboards, so I orders the Hanger Steak+Frites ($20 special), it comes with chimichurri, and succotash that has a char to it: the delivery of the dish is problematic, as it's brought out on a sizzling fajita like cast iron skillet, so when I order my steak medium or medium rare, it's well done by the time it makes it to me; we all know food continues to cook after you take it off the grill etc. the steak portion was small and drowned in the chimichurri I had to dig for it, literally lol. The frites were good, the succotash had a char to it that overpowered the taste, I only tasted char the whole time and because the skillet was piping hot forever it took me a long time to eat, the food was too hot temperature wise to eat it. My date was almost done by time I could eat. Happy Hour: well drinks, draft beers $5, great deal!! The guy with the beard poured nicely lol also the pineapple beer was good and refreshing, the Montauk watermelon was a no, you don't taste any watermelon.  High note: my dates pork-belly tacos were great!! You get 3 I ate one of them, since they claim they were spicy, either the drizzle or the pickled cabbage has the spice, i liked them!  3.5 stars, I'll come back to try something else and or atleast to drink, but it's summer in NYC turn on your damn a/c.	3star
I assumed this was like a sit down style restaurant... it's not! But what it is - cheap and cheerful with a few high benches and quality comfort food with a Mexican take... the food was good... full of flavour it's byob so went around the corner to the store... it's not a place to linger with a beer but it is a satisfying food pit stop!	5star
I go here at least once a week. The minced pork noodle soup and dumpling combo is the way to go. Get both and bask in the glory that is this this majestic hole-in-the-wall.	5star
This is a review of the even by Tasting Collective that we attended. It was a 10-Course Globally Inspired Feast. Ever since I joined Tasting Collective, the name Traif kept coming up as everyone's favorite restaurant event. And this is a diners club of food lovers, I had to go and try it out! The interior is simple and industrial, chilled, and with very cool, modern, abstract art decor throughout. I liked the mix of straight and curved lines, minimal but yet distinctive colors, simple furniture and warm, soft light inviting customers in. They had a very lovely patio in the back. I really liked it here, it had more natural light coming in before the Sun went down, and then lit up with festive string lights. They had good amount of greenery around it that made the space even more relaxing. We started off with a couple of drinks. We chose Yuzu Kosho and Drink Like its Spring. They were both very tasty, high quality and strong. For food, we got to try Crispy Sweetbreads, Cured Fluke Sashimi, Dry-Aged Venison, Roasted Berkshire Pork Belly, Roasted Rainbow Carrots, Salt & Pepper Hamachi Collar Wraps, Seared Scallops & Risotto, Smoked Lamb Puttanesca Cavatelli, Toasted Pistachio Budino, and Warm Sugar Maple Pie. All these dishes, one word: Amazing!!! I now know the reason why this is the most popular spot among the Tasting Collective members. My taste buds were having the time of their lives the entire night! I would love to go back again for more of their amazing dishes! Read my full review of the restaurant and food on my food blog, foodlovergirl.	5star
I was looking for some good Malay food in New York and came here with my family. We ordered the more Chinese dishes, which we all found pretty good. The roti canai was crispy and dry; I wish it were softer and thicker.	4star
We hadn't been here in almost 8 months before having dinner last week.  While the service was excellent the changes to the menu were decidedly for the worse.  My daughter had the carbonara, which advertised cream as traditionally prepared, but which was a buttery broth smothered in Parmesan.  The flavor was overwhelmingly Parmesan and butter, and difficult to eat. The pancetta was also odd - big chewy chunks, like ham - not traditional smoked small bites.  I had the di Mare, which had a marinara sauce that was like a thick soup.  It overwhelmed the seafood and pasta.  The shrimp was rubbery and dry, looked like it had been cooked that afternoon.  This was one of my daughters favorite places to eat because it had gluten free options but she left very disappointed and said the Olive Garden near her friends in Jersey was better.	2star
Make a reservation!  This place seems to always be packed and a lot of times isn't even accepting walk-ins.  It's a family style restaurant which means portions are HUUUGGEEE (*said in Donald Trump voice).  Each menu item is enough to feed at least 3 people.  Yes, even very hungry adults.  I was with one other person and we got 2 appetizers and 1 entree and it was embarrassing how much food was in front of us.  It could have fed a family of 6.   All of the food was delicious and they will happily pack up your leftovers in an aluminum catering pan (that's how much food there is).	4star
I went to Cha-An with my sis. We waited for a while and we didn't mind. Once we got our seats and waited 10mins. A waitress came and took out menu away. Other people came after us and they got their order and water. We were sitting there with no water or server to ask us if we ordered. I never had this bad experience before in Cha-An.	1star
"HH M-F 4-6 pm only at the bar  We got there around 5 and the restaurant was near empty. We asked if we could get HH outside. Request denied. I don't understand why when you can literally hear crickets we HAVE to sit at the bar for HH. In the end, we just ordered our drinks at the bar, closed out and sat outside.  We got Golden sachet-chicken and crab meat- ""A-u"" better not fall for the cutesy presentation of this dish. This dish was so adorable, but it was just ok. I wouldn't get it again.  Fried chicken dumplings- you're a ""chicken"" if a little bit of extra calories from being fried scares you in to choosing steamed dumplings instead. This was ok, but I've had better for cheaper Crab Rangoon-his was the worst of the three. It has SOO much sour cream. They were being so ""shellfish"" with skimping us on the crab.  All in all, just a cute little restaurant."	2star
Solid place to get wine and have a light bite with friends. They have a good wine selection and the service is awesome. It's not classy nor fancy, but it's nice in that your group can be loud without feeling rude. The entree portion is a bit small for its price. We ordered the duck confit and it was well done.  The charcuterie is awesome. It came with pickles, grapes, dry eggplants, jams, etc	3star
We visited NYC one weekend and were super excited for the food. Cookshop was at the top of our list. We made reservations for 7:00 on a Saturday night two months ahead of time. Overall, we had a great experience. At first, it was a little iffy. We arrived at 6:50 for our rez but ended up not being seated until 7:15. It wasn't a huge deal, but after noticing several other people with reservations who still hadn't been seated 15 minutes after their scheduled times, it was hard to ignore. Wine and cocktail selections were solid. They also had some nice scotches. We started with the roasted cauliflower, which I would say was the highlight of our meal. For entrees, I got the seafood bordetto and my fiancé ordered the wagyu steak. We loved both, but neither made us anymore excited than what we can get here in Portland. For dessert, we did the sticky toffee pudding and the Swiss cake roll. I highly recommend the stick toffee pudding. The ice cream it came with was phenomenal.  Great atmosphere and great service, just not quite the 5 star review I expected.	4star
Awful for takeout. Hainanese chicken was cold, dry and had some yellow food coloring on the skin. The stuffed vegetables with fish meat was undercooked in the Young tofu curry soup. Waited for 25 min and paid cash to pick up under cooked food. Very disappointed.	2star
4.5 STARS TL;DR: Overall (4.5 star): It's no fluke most revere Peter Luger's as NY's best steakhouse. It could be argued best in East coast. But with the reverence comes hubris and it shows. The steak is phenomenal, ambiance is impeccable, and the service is immaculate but you get the sense of smug and unnecessary opulence of their experience. FULL REVIEW: Service (1 star): A place of high society and prestigious undertaking and so the service treats you such.  Excellent, proper and more importantly fitting. Menu (1 star): Classy, clutter-free and just the essentials. You have your famous cuts in addition to sides and few other things to satisfy everyone else. Pricing (0.5 star): I am aware of the price matching the place and history but that doesn't mean it's right. Has room to be more affordable for more people to enjoy the experience. Presentation/Atmosphere (1 star): Pristine. It's a show you see and taste. It's orchestrated, undisturbed and places you in a more simpler, classier time. Everyone's in on the agenda and you should come equally prepared and with a respectful mindset.  Taste (1 star): Unquestionably great. I'm sure people will come with their on pretenses (e.g. preferring a wellness higher than what's recommended) but you should trust the establishment when they suggest you eat it in a particular way. You get to really taste the meat and it's a world of difference between what you eat here and what you've had in most other places. FYI asking for it well done is almost a little disrespectful and the waiters will take offense to that. Bill: $700 (with 20% gratuity at our own discretion). Porterhouse for 8 with sides and two bottles of red. Enjoy!	4star
This review is for food only. I don't understand all the great reviews for this place raving about avocado fries and lamb burger. We tried both and they were not good. We also had the flatbread with lamb sausage, it was made with zero effort and barely any sausage in it. Our waitress was great and the service was good but the food was a disappointment. I won't eat here again but may stop by for drinks only next time.	2star
Pros: everything; the Cajun special sauce - get the spicy. The shrimp and lobster and crab legs, the really good draft beer selections, getting a bib tied around your neck like a boss. Casually gesturing to your dining mate while wearing bright blue surgical gloves, the mac n cheese, getting sat much sooner than you'd expect. Get 3 pounds for 2 people! Yum! Cons: they don't take reservations! They always say it's like a 35 minute wait, so I go next door to the shady taxidermy bar - home sweet home - for some four dollar terrible cocktails, numerous dead animals on the walls, and an aggressive disco ball dance floor for 7pm, and by the time I get my well vodka with flat soda, boom! My table is ready and I'm chugging and hustling back to the Boil!  It's also not super cheap, but it is really good!	5star
This review should be more of a 3 1/2 star review but Yelp won't let me do that.  Really cute place with friendly and accommodating staff. It did take our waiter a little long to notice us but it was super packed.  I went for brunch and got the kale salad and huevos rancheros with a mimosa. Drinks were a little more expensive than I would've liked. Around $8-$9. No brunch deals here. Kale salad was meh didn't really taste like much. Huevos were really go I wouldn't totally write this place off it's just not my favorite. It's worth a try though!	3star
Wonderful oysters!  The best I have had outside of Normandy.  Very friendly staff and the rest of the menu is outstanding as well.  We shared a cioppino: very fresh, plump clams and mussels, scallop and fish.  Not over cooked and simple.  Looking forward to coming back for the rest of the menu.	5star
Food is hit and miss, service is painfully slow. Even the deserts took 30 minutes. Hummus Tzatziki & Babaganooj were good. The calamari was two large calamari with a very large piece  of feta in between, all broiled together and awful. felafel were good. Israeli salad was clearly old--soggy with a tang.  The $35 fish pushed by the waiter was over-cooked and tough.  For $50/person and only one of us ordered a main dish as the main dish, we won't be back anytime soon which is a shame since the Upper Westside is saturated with Italian and Japanese restaurants and is badly in need of other cuisines.	2star
"Very rude staff. We asked to split the bill by paying half cash and half on card and he said that was fine,  he accepts the cash money then brings back the receipt and he has charged the full amount. I told him if he could refund and he was so angry and raised his voice saying ""he doesn't split bills"" and ""[I] need to understand that because it's a small neighborhood bar"". I wanted to tell him he should've mentioned that before accepting double payment but instead just waited for my refund and he goes ""fine can I just give you cash?"" I said sure, he takes out cash and slams it on the bar. Horrible service, never coming back."	1star
Decided to try a new place in Chelsea Market & I can't believe I've never gotten tacos here before! I got the Carne Asada & Adobado (i can't spell it) tacos & they were delicious! The meat was so soft and extremely well marinated. Now I know where to get tacos when I'm craving them!	4star
Everything we ordered was extremely salty. Waitress highly recommended the Tebasaki Gyoza which is deep fried chicken wings stuffed with foie and brioche. Chicken wings were salty, undercooked and pink. Waitress said the chicken is checked for temperature before being served to customers. We showed her the undercooked chicken.  We ordered 2 bowls of Tonkatsu Ramen. It was extremely salty. Our waitress recommended adding a poach egg. Poached egg was raw. Waitress just basically cracked a raw egg into each ramen bowl. Our poached eggs doesn't look anything like their pictures on instagram. Everything the waitress suggested was a diaster. Now I have a stomachache. I won't be going back!!!!	1star
Went with a couple friends on a Friday night. I have heard about this place for a while now and was excited to finally try it. It is difficult as I don't venture into bk often. We shared the Stuffed Squid (delicious), truffle bulgogi mac & cheese (delicious), duck confit (done exactly at the right amount so the meat was very tender), Wagyu beef burger (it was average) and the mushroom bibimbap (good). For dessert, we had the chocolate dome which was delicious.  We stayed there for a while and they never really kicked us out. It was busy but not packed. Cool decor and vibe. I recommend it if you are in the neighborhood.	4star
Left the restaurant last night disappointed  They were busy so I asked the waitress if they take names. They didn't take names, so I couldn't leave. Instead I was supposed to just stand in front of the crowded area with the heat blasting in front of me and my girlfriend. If they took names and number I can come back and not be crowding the front door blocking people from coming in ... Bad restaurant decision  went to another restaurant...	2star
Food was great, but every week when I'm walking by late, I'm seeing  a rat by they garbage. I think that they can be on a kitchen as well. It stopped me go to that place	1star
Great place to hang out and have a couple drinks. Its a cool chill spot. The food was ok i just don't think its worth  it for the price.	4star
"Ugly indeed. While the place was jam packed and they were busy, I can't excuse shitty service /poor hygiene/and bland/underwhelming food. Tue Ka Ko fried little coconut milk cakes with black bean & taro - I thought this would be flavorful but no. The cake itself was bland. The sauce that accompanied it helped but even after drowning the cake in it - it didn't help it enough.  Kanom Jean Nam - rice vermicelli, green curry chicken, chilies - no complexity in the curry - it was a pile of vermicelli noodles with pieces of chicken. It was spicy to the point where no other flavor could be detected. I don't mind food being spicy but as long as all the other flavors still pull through. Gratuitous spice is just as bad as someone yelling ""fuck"" over and over again to get their point across. It's futile.  Service: chaotic. unorganized. not aware of their own space. sneezing into their hands and not washing after. not taking my order until flagging someone down. requested extra sauce: took about 5 minutes to receive while they attended to other things. Just a lack of common sense in their steps of service.  They deliver as well. By the amount of to go boxes piling up, I imagine many of their problems are due to expanding to delivery without having enough bandwidth to take it all on.  Also: efficiency would be stepped up if they would invest in a POS device instead of handwriting orders. Waste of time."	2star
So... the BBQ is good (have high standards after returning from Memphis) however, it took an hour to stand in line for already cooked food. Was very confused about the slowness of the line... and I'm super patient! The brisket was moist and melted in my mouth, but I'm not sure I'd wait in line for an hour next time...  If you do go, order the baked beans. They were da bomb.	3star
This place was pretty good. Very flavorful dishes. If you're really hungry, I wouldn't suggest it as the individual portions are somewhat small. Why not order more portions, you ask? Well, the prices are rather steep in my opinion. Do what I did and go get your meal on a colleague's expense account.	4star
"Because of the high rating on Yelp, I had a high expectation. Atmosphere was nice, but the food and service were just okay.  It opens at 10:30 am on weekends. I arrived just on time and people already started to come in pairs and groups. NOTICE that all the parties need to be present in order to be seated for groups of 3 or more. Around 10:50, the restaurant was full. I saw a photo of biscuits and non-sausage gravy on Yelp, so I asked about it. Our server coldly responded:"" All I have is on here (the menu) and there (the specials menu on the wall)."" She even didn't consult the kitchen and see if they can do a vegan style, which is fine since I understand that they were likely not able to accommodate this request. I was just annoyed by her attitude and the way she talks!!! Even worse, she did NOT check on us, or refill our water, or asked if we need our check when she passed by at the point of time we OBVIOUSLY had finished our food. We had to call her up, and the only communication she had with us after ordering was asked if everything was good, when she collected our plates. No greetings when we left, like nobody cared. My Biscuit Egg and Cheddar Sandwich (white cheddar) was so so. It came with salad and fried potatoes. They were all okay, but I did not like their biscuits because they were sweet. And very little cheddar cheese and it was barely melted.  Overall, lovely interior design, ambiance, and quick service, but average food and disappointing service quality."	3star
Josh was theee best server! Traif has been on my list for years at this point, but I never found myself willing to trek to the Billy Burg just to try it. Shame on me. We came for our anniversary and sat inside. My boyfriend was able to get reservations just a day in advance. Having scoured Yelp already for all the good dishes to try, I already had a pretty good idea of what I wanted.  We ordered the Tuna Tartare, Cinnamon Ribs, Gnocchi, Pork Belly, and Scallops. The tuna tartare was amazing and easily the best thing we ate the entire night. I wish we had ordered two of them. Our second favorite dish was the scallops with corn risotto. It was also delicious, and the scallops were perfect! Everything was great and if I could re-do my entire meal, it would be only to order less drinks and more food so I could have tried more. I'm definitely coming back, Traif!	4star
First time here.Loved my dish and they are not stingy with the food. Hubby said food was good. I had the French toast meal. Lady at the bar kept my beverage coming without having to ask.	4star
Juliana's Pizza lives up to the hype. Being a born and raised in Brooklyn you get to know your pizza places very fast. It was the first time visiting Juliana's Pizza. After you walk in to Juliana's Pizza you are greeted with a nice welcome. As we arrived right before the peak of the lunch hour. After being seated you drink orders are taken. Our server came over after couple minutes to see if we had any questions on the menu. As we already knew what to order. So we started off with an appetizer. The meatballs with tomato sauce. For the pizza we had Margherita Pizza.  If you are a true pizza lover and never had NY pizza you are in for a real treat. Living on the west coast you really miss NY pizza. On my visit to NY it was a must to have pizza. The meatballs were truly amazing. Very fresh and perfect flavoring. I have to admit it was the best Margherita Pizza I had in town. You can be the judge about the pizza. No questions the next time I am back in NY I will be visiting Juliana's Pizza. From the minute you arrive to the minute you leave Juliana's Pizza the customer service is first class. If you live or visiting NY Juliana's Pizza is a must.	5star
Extremely disappointed in this place, they dress and somewhat cook like the Tijuana tacos but they are definitely are not even close! A bit overpriced too....oh and they have no seats so be prepared to stand.	2star
Delicious!! Felt like I was back in New Orleans. Friendly staff and awesome atmosphere. If I could give this place six stars, I would. Definitely recommend!!  Ps - the biscuits, praline bacon and hash browns (off the brunch menu) are out of this world!!!	5star
I came here with my mother based on recommendation of it being a great American based restaurant. When I arrived it was mostly a seafood based menu, so I ordered calamari (fried and also sauteed in a salad). Unfortunately, the salad's calamari made me extremely sick. Although no one else I know has had food poisoning from Jane, and their food is good otherwise, the waiters were slow. The location is nice and there is much to do in the area. The music was also nice and the restaurant itself is very upscale.	2star
The food is typical Thai ok. The service is terribly slow and the place isn't even packed. If you're in a rush to get some food before a show, don't come here!	3star
"This is the story of one restaurant experience ruined by horrible patrons and terrible management.  We were there as a big group and things went well. Nice drinks, tasty food. But it was a big group, a birthday celebration so it took us a little longer than usual to settle things down, figure the check out, pay, and leave. While all this was happening, it also started pouring rain which left us more reluctant to hurry out. Until we were verbally harassed by a bunch of drunk patrons. They were promised our table and could not hold their patience (and obviously their liquor) until we left.  It started by making sarcastic remarks like pulling out some of our chairs as we stood up and saying if it took this long for us to leave, there should be some reason for it. We let it wash over us. Then they move towards the table, shouting and ""making jokes"" about how much they can't wait for us to leave. And then when we protested, they used the c word towards a woman in our group.  What did the management do? Other than introducing themselves by name (as if it changes what they are letting happen in their restaurants) and ushering us out of the space by some fake apology, nothing. They told us they also didn't want rude patrons like that, and we were amazingly understanding, and yada yada yada. When I protested saying in such distasteful event, it was kind of odd that we were ushered out of the restaurant with a bad taste in our mouth while drunk people verbally harassing ""amazingly understanding"" people were still given their tables and service. The management said he was going to ask them to leave but had to wait until we left the venue. When the last pair of our group left the environs of the restaurant, the patron who shouted the c word was doing shots and ordering his food. I guess he is more welcome than us, amazingly understanding people of this story. Don't go there unless you will ""fight for your place."" Period."	1star
Love love love Sugar Freak. I have been here a few times for their brunch. I also went to the last brunch that they had as the location has been closed. The wait at this spot sometimes can be ridiculous but it is so worth it. The food is so delicious. I love their grits and the biscuits don't disappoint. I really am hoping that this spot opens up again because I will def miss all the great food I had here. Portions are pretty big, so it may be best to not get any appetizers for brunch. An entrée is more than enough food. The décor is very southern and it makes you feel like you are in the South surrounded by antique lights, wall decorations etc. Highly recommended if it opens up again!!	5star
"Our excursion to Milk and Roses came to be by way of Groupon:  ""$19 Wine and Cheese Pairing: Includes 2 Platters of Your Choice from Caciocavallo , Caprino, Crotonese, and 2  Glasses of wine from Merlot, Dolcetto, Chianti and Aglianico."" Just getting to Milk & Roses can be a daunting task. If you're not a Brooklyn resident that lives in close proximity to the location, you're going to have to do some walking if not taking a taxi. We arrived in the neighborhood via the subway system, and the station, sadly, was not located within a convenient distance. Nevertheless, I was determined to redeem the Groupon before departing NYC; therefore, we hoofed it across the lengthy frigid roads, in spite of being vexed by our irksome predicament.  Milk & Roses (M&R) exudes a personality all it's own. Dim lighting, full bookshelves, students typing on laptops, flea-infested canines tied up outside the door, and filthy, B.O.-ridden hippies/transients making out on the sofa are all characteristics that make M&R unique. Indeed, it's a shame that upon entering the doorway that our excitement was tempered by being asphyxiated by the foul, offensive stench of two refugees from the street. Nevertheless, we were determined to make the best of the situation. The waitress was extremely sweet, hospitable and accommodating. We couldn't have asked for a better person to wait on us. We both enjoyed our wine selections, and also loved the cheese board that was presented. All in all, the value for what was provided was superb. Most of all, the extraordinary attention given to us by the waitress to ensure we were content was the best part of the evening. I probably won't be returning to M&R on future trips, but that has to do with convenience more than anything. If you're a local, it's certainly worth a visit."	3star
I was so excited to try Mario Batali's restaurants and Babbo did not disappoint.  We were seated upstairs at 5:30pm since it was either that or 9pm.  Note: good reservations are hard to come by so book in advance.  We were brought to a table upstairs where there was a lot of light and window dressed mirrors which made the space look large and open.  Although upstairs was nice, I definitely recommend being seated downstairs as it is more romantic and cozy with the booth seating.  Now onto the food... Compliments of the chef: Chickpea crostini was so tastyyy starting off the meal on a positive note    Appetizers: Caprese salad with buffalo mozzarella was SO delicious - the cheese was melt in your mouth good and salted on point.  Beet tartre served with mustard and anchovies was surprisingly interesting.  Grilled octopus was so tender and delicious, I recommend trying this!    Pasta: Bolognese (we split an order and it was so delicioussssssss I would order this as a main) Mains: Scallops with corn salsa was very unique and tasy, Lamb chops SO delicious would definitely recommend this, and Branzino was also amazing and a large portion   Dessert: Pistachio Chocolate Semifreddo one of their signature desserts was amazing and satisfied my large sweet tooth which is hard to accompish.  The Cheese cake with coconut SOoooo delicious I would get this again next time as well.   The only bad thing I have to say about this restaurant is the price of the wine, which was kind of outrageous, and there are so many bus boys you don't know who is helping you or who will show up next. I wouldn't deduct a star for this as I thought the food was wonderful and the service amazing.  I will most certainly be back for a special occasion of some sort and would recommend you going !	5star
The big V-Day. Should spice the love up with some french food right? Might get some brownie points hopefully.  V-day menu $169 - 4 course: salad, app., main, dessert.  We got: Salad - basic with some mango Escargots a la Bourguignone - very tender and good! Caviar Argenté d'Esturgeon Americain (15gr) + extra $20 - meh not worth it Kassulet Toulousain de la Maison (Signature) - heavy, but good Tournedos Rossini - over cooked and smaller than a baby's hand, you will probably go hungry... doesn't come with much.  Came with a tray of 4 veggies - string beans, squash, mash carrot, and forgot the last one - veggies was like eating baby food, mushy and underseasoned.  Dessert - mixed - Sorbet, Ice cream, and Banana Brule - pretty decent with the banana brule being the highlight. +1 bottle of wine $60 - good wine Total $325  Sounds like an okay evening right? Terrible service!  - didn't offer us any bread - took forever to take our order, this was at 5pm on v-day and it wasn't jam packed.  - did not ask how I would like my steak cooked... why get a filet mignon at all!  - Website had a banner running with BYOB yet at the restaurant, it was rejected, feel bad for the couples that had to carry the bottle in the freezing weather - dirty tables and glass - Lastly, space! For a $$$ they mike the hell out of this space. Never have I felt so squeezed and uncomfortable. Especially when 7pm comes and you get that crowd rushing in and their ass is literally in your face. -P.S they should probably clean their bathroom more, Saw 2 couples coming out of the bathroom... pre-game fun?   - NOTE THEY ONLY TAKE AMEX or CASH! (They got an ATM right at the entrance). So leave those good old master card at home they're not welcomed.  Overall, is it definitely not worth $$$ and the food was just ok. For that price, there are many other great french restaurants with better service and atmosphere!	2star
Had a fabulous dinner with Kathy and Chris. We started with the clams oreganata which were wonderful. Then Kathy had the endive salad which was best I've had. Also had the meatballs. Great. For dinner we had the carbanara and was really good and so filling. Christopher had the Alfredo and Kathy a delicious macaroni  Service was great.	5star
New favorite bar - wish we lived closer! Bartenders are super friendly, great ambiance, great music, great cocktails. Lots of space and can actually just hang out for hours and chill with your friends and hear each other talk! Love. Such a refreshing space.	5star
A nice looking place with decent chicken and little else. The service was overbearing at the beginning and completely lacking at the end. The watermelon salad was a mixed of artificial sweetness and acidic pickle taste. The mac and cheese was sour and at the same time tasteless. My Arnold Palmer was too sharp. So maybe come here for a drink and get some chicken or just don't come here.	2star
We went in to eat but they refused to seat us because one of the party members was under 21. We didn't request to sit at the bar, and pointed out that there's a child sitting in the finding room. The host just laughed. If you're a bar, why is there a kid there? That's pretty illegal. If you're a restaurant, you just discriminated. Get your story straight.	1star
Nice place to stop by as a brunch option if you live in the neighborhood!  Sliders, Mac&Cheese, Fried chicken and waffles are all dishes I would get again. I didn't like the crab cake- it had red peppers or something in it and the crunch and slight sour taste you don't normally find in a crab cake was throwing me off a bit.	4star
I had a hard time deciding what rating to give this place. It was an unusual ambiance where I sat, which was in the area that is actually part of their sister restaurant. Food was good, but not great. I wouldn't tell someone not to come but I wouldn't recommend it either. Servers were very friendly and probably the highlight of the experience. Unfortunately, with so many places in the city, this one is not one I would consider trying again.	3star
Walked in at 11:10 for 3 people they said 30-35 minutes.  It took over an hour for them to seat us 12:15.  We ate and we out by 12:30. Food wasn't that great either.	2star
Still writing a 5 star review for this food joint.  We got the bulgogi banh mi with runny egg and kimchi loaded fries.  HEAVENLY GOOD The beef was flavorful and easy to chew. The fries was cooked upon order so it was fresh and hot. I can't say anything bad about it. Nothing. Nada. None.  Seriously, it's that good.  Check in using the yelp app, for a free egg, but you have to purchase one food with egg before you can claim the offer. Still good.	5star
Awful service, waiter barely attended to the table. Pasta was undercooked and waiter did not apologize. Will not be going back. On a side note, their meat plate is terrible.	1star
We visited New York City for my birthday and we lost track of time before our Broadway show. Realising how busy restaurants would be without a reservation, we opted for delivery from OBAO since their menu appealed to all three of us and they had the least delivery time. We ordered three items from their dinner menu: some roasted duck noodles, cashew chili chicken, and a minced chicken dish called Kra Pow Gai Kai Dad. The food arrived quickly within the promised time to our hotel room. My husband enjoyed the sautéed sesame noodles with shredded oven roasted duck, scallion, and cilantro. My cashew chili chicken was crisp with yellow and green onions, and red bell peppers. Our friend really enjoyed his minced chicken seasoned with holy basil, bird's eye chili, garlic, and onion. The dish also came with a fried egg served over rice and veg. While my husband enjoyed his meal, he didn't feel it was worth the $14 price. We also ordered Thai ice tea that came in plastic takeaway soup containers which made it awkward to sip without straws. If we were in town again at the same hotel, I'd order from them again to try different things from their menu.	4star
Went for brunch a few weeks ago. Great table and they took us right away.  Food was good but two big factors lead to a 2 star. They forgot my meal (serviced the rest of table) and when I got my fried chicken sandwich, the was cold. Kinda just felt like they poorly microwaved a Tyson chicken cutlet.	2star
What an experience.  Billy Durney has managed to take BBQ to a whole new level.  We had a tasting of every item on the menu and to be really honest it did not disappoint. Out of the whole menu the faves are as follows.   (Take in consideration I am a Texan and BBQ is not only my hobby but also my business.  And was not expecting to be blown away.  )  Thick slab Pastrami Bacon is a religious experience , wood fired chicken is unlike and chicken at any BBQ spot ever.  Hot Wings are to die for and the Korean Sticky ribs are incredible    The pork spare ribs were also right on point.   Beef Brisket , and Beef Rib are really excellent especially for NY.  The sides all rock.  The Texas Style Queso Mac is exceptional, the Potato salad is really good as well.  Don't forget the Pickles! The slaw was also pretty awesome.   The Corn Bread and the Banana Cream Pudding are both a must!  On the not my favorite side was the jerk ribs , they are good but not phenomenal, and the smoked pit beans were also good but more along the side of a baked bean.  Overall experience was a 10 with the food , staff and ambiance.   I'll be back again for sure.	5star
Waited all that time and didn't try the pork dumplings. Do they make the same mistake. A neighbor let me try one and holy moly they're moist, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. Be aware that if you come with a small group (there were two of us), you might be seated with other pairs. Our table was a 6 person party of strangers and at first it was awkward but we got over it. I think we were just glad to finally be seated.  The sesame chicken was good but nothing out of the ordinary. My advice is to check the menu and the reviews prior to going there--the waiters aren't the most helpful and you'll be rushed so know what you want. Cool place. I'll be back for the dumplings.	4star
Don't understand the hype. I always love bone-marrow, in any shape or form, but this one was doused in peanut sauce to the point where I didn't exactly taste the marrow anymore. Yellow curry noodle... ok, with a huge amounts of fish-sauce/paste that comes on the side (otherwise somewhat bland). Crab fried rice... decent - but again, more on the bland side. But why does this cost 2.5x of what fried rice costs at most other places? Honestly don't get why everyone raves about it.	2star
I'm reluctant to write this because I don't want the word to get out lol  I adore this restaurant. I've been here more than 10 times and have never been disappointed with a single dish. The soup dumplings are great. I always get the hot and sour soup and the shrimp in spicy Szechuan sauce. I have had other dishes as well, none of them failed to please.  I will certainly be back	5star
"Unsure what the craze is about this place.  It just tasted like a normal thai restaurant.  I had the curries and they weren't too great -- a bit too salty if you ask me.   The good mood was already ruined when we didn't know that there was seating in the back when you first walk in.  The staff member said she asked us if we wanted take out or eat in -- but my friend and I both did not hear her ask that.  We were ordering assuming that we can just eat in the front area, not knowing there was waiting service in the tables in the back.  We wanted to sit around, so we had to ask her to change the order to a sit-in.  Weird vibes.. and weird atmosphere came around and I especially felt guilty about making her change the order.  Then it was even more weird when my friend already paid for the ""Take out "" order and I didn't ...  I hope they didn't spit in my food :) I wasn't trying to be difficult! But I guess they should make sure people know there is an option to sit in and have waiting service in the back -- it is quite hidden. Probably won't come back here to sit in -- eh.. weird vibes.. weird vibes.  It was pretty pricey too. I was hungry the next moment."	3star
UPDATE: I don't know what happened. Overall, the food was extremely bland and did not have that homemade flavor as in the past. The spinach and candied yams tasted as if they came straight from a can. The catfish strips were so salty I couldn't finish them. Even the mac and cheese missed the mark. Where was the cheese?  No one in my party finished their food. My friend ate the catfish strips and immediately started to have an allergic reaction. She's only allergic to tilapia so I don't know how this happened. Luckily another person in our party carries Benadryl with them! Thoroughly disappointed with Melba's. My appetite was not satisfied. They'll be on the back burner for a minute.	2star
"They do have a beautiful view and a nice decoration inside but if you are like me and care about your reputation recommending places to friends believe me you would rather not choose this one. In most of my reviews I give 5 stars because it's way to say ""thumps up"" go there, however this place is a ""no no"" therefore my harsh 1 star. Before going there I had checked the menu and prices and thought they had pizzas and other Italian items that I might like. However because we were a large group of 8 they didn't let us choose individual items and forced us to go for the $40 pre-fixed menu. The pre-fix is basically 3 appetizers and 3 entrees. None of the choices looked appealing to me, yet I had to go for those. To be fair, my Italian friend said the Burrata was above average for New York, but that's it; as the eggs that followed were very average and the overall quantity of food in the pre-fix proved to be light. I left the table still hungry not daring adding a $17 pizza to my already pricey $40 brunch food items. I was super embarrassed for my friends who wanted to keep this under a small budget but they couldn't. In addition, when the bill came they added the tip to our cards without asking our permission. I myself regularly spend $60 to $80 on brunches without giving it a second thought, but them removing spending control from us really made me angry. In summary, this place is very expensive for what you get and their strategy is to optimize on squeezing money out of you with prefixed and tip already included. Ok that was about the restaurant generally speaking... Now let's talk about this very bad incident that happened to the Italian friend I brought with me. The following Monday of that weekend she noticed a $645 transaction whereas we were all given ticket receipt of $90 per person. The bill was split equally among the 8 of us. My friend called them complaining, they kept saying that the manager will call her back and solve the problem, but no action was being taken after multiple attempts throughout the week. Then on the Friday she reached someone who told her that they won't give her money back unless we gather the money from the other individuals who didn't get charged, unbelievable... Can you imagine us what we had to do? Contacting individually everyone, checking if they actually got charged, collecting the money, etc... all this to solve a transaction they illegally executed (ticket receipt was not showing $645). Facing this BS, my friend and I went in person on our own free time to the restaurant so we solve the problem. There it took us 30 minutes to be finally put in touch with the relevant person, they were still playing us hoping we'd give up. It's like they wanted us to make a scene and finally be heard; or otherwise it's assumed you don't care enough about the money. When the manager came the interaction was succinct. He just asked us the transaction we wanted to go away and fixed it immediately, no explanation whatsoever provided. Very weird. I suspect the staff fucked up and tried to cover their mistake hoping we won't care enough about $645 and challenged us to it. In the end, I didn't even pay for that meal so it's not all bad but god I won't ever go back there... So much time and energy wasted for little reason..."	1star
"Came in, got 5 waters with 1 spilled all over us. Waiter, said ""it wasn't me"" so he wasn't willing to make amends. The bus boy as well as the waiter implied that he was going to give us a round a shots and then told us we would be charged afterwards. First time here, terrible experience."	1star
Great restaurant for a nice date or dinner with friends. They definitely focus on the freshness and deliciousness of the produce. we found that the proteins were a little lacking in comparison.   Space is dimly lit but well decorated and modern. Like any other restaurant in New York space is tight but the restaurant makes you feel comfortable and it's cozy enough.  We had the mushroom pizza and fish course both of which were good. The pizza has mushrooms, truffle oil, a fried egg and some other things that all make it a delicious umami bomb. Fish was a little overcooked and not particularly flavorful but the greens and tomato saved it. Expect to spend about $50 per person if you get a couple things. Great fresh food, particularly anything veggie. Not sure the service is up to par for the nice restaurant tier they're in. A little slow getting people's attention, no check ins, small stuff like that is lacking.	4star
Came here for my best friends birthday GNO in September. They don't take reservations but we only had to wait 30 minutes for a party of 3 on a Thursday night. Definitely try to come for happy hour 5-7pm. Its $12 for 6 oysters & a beer OR 6 oysters & a glass of wine.  Upstate has a great selection of east & west coast oysters & beers/wines that changes daily. Its easy to reorder another round as the restaurant is small, & the waiters attend to you quickly. Our food came out fast, as well. Drinks: They had a tangerine beer my bf loved & I fully enjoyed my stout (if you're into dark beers). Food: I recommend the fettuccine with clams. SIMPLE but so flavorful in garlic & came with lots of clams. I felt it needed a dash of salt nothing crazy but once we added some, it was phenomenal-- I could've licked the plate clean. We also had the scallops which were cooked perfectly. Presentation and flavors were on point.  For my girlfriends birthday, they brought out a few thin slices of bourbon pound cake on the house. It was..... absolutely HEAVENLY. We scarfed it down in seconds and asked if we could actually order some. The waitress said they dont serve it on the menu----they make a certain amount everyday for customers celebrating special occasions birthdays, etc. and its always out by the end of the night. We begged her, said we would pay for it and luckily for us, it was the waitresses birthday too!! She was feeling extra generous & she gave us another plate of some more slices & told us to enjoy it on her behalf. She was so awesome!  Food, ambiance, service was top notch. Definitely recommend!	5star
Every weekend it is packed here! In order to get a table for a Sunday brunch, one has to wait at least 40-50 minutes. We came around 2pm to avoid the line, but we still had to wait for ~20min to get a table.  But the food was worth it. We were greeted with some complementary hot and fluffy homemade corn bread. It immediately felt like we were at someone's kitchen. We ordered the classic chicken and waffle (Reverend Al Sharpton). The fried chicken breast and thigh had a very crispy coat. However, I was hoping for some impressive seasoning/flavor on the coat to make Amy Ruth's unforgettable. Don't get me wrong. It was great fried chicken, but a little more flavor would have hit the spot! The waffle was fluffy and light in texture, making the whole dish a hearty and fulfilling meal. Their proportions are bigger than most of the other places in downtown.  I would definitely come here again if I ever crave for a decent chicken and waffle dish.	4star
Cafe Habana is kind of like a Cuban diner.  It's casual. It's cheap. And has drool worthy comfort food.  I was so excited to pay my first visit to this Cuban gem on a cold, snowy day for some late Saturday brunch.  We were seated in about 15 minutes, much shorter than a typical wait I am told, though we were crammed in the front of the restaurant waiting for a few other parties to be seated as well. The place is definitely becoming more touristy though - overheard lots of visitors saying they read about this place... We got a great corner booth seat but super tight quarters, so we had no choice but to make friends with the other lovely couple dining with us. I began my meal with a Mexican Hot Chocolate - which was amazing and wish was a standard at my local coffee shop, or Starbucks.  Shared some of the famous Grilled Mexican Style Corn which I have to say was pretty tasty and a little spicy...though while it was great, I must say it was not completely out of the ordinary for this dish.  For my main, I had the Molletes - a hero with refried black beans, melted mozzarella, pico and salsa verde.  And of course added chorizo. Ginormous and delicious.  Overall, we were more than satisfied with our $25 brunch and have certainly not seen the last of this Soho staple.	4star
"My last experience with this place really makes me not want to venture out here anymore.  They literally had us wait an hour when they told us 30min. In the end, we were on the last few people waiting to be seated. Meanwhile, there were at least 4 tables that were clearly done and they didn't even mention anything to them. There's nothing wrong with dropping off a bill and just saying ""Please pay whenever you are ready."" It's Chinatown, the tables are tourists, and there are other patrons waiting while they are preparing to close. We finally get seated and at that point, we were so annoyed that we barely even wanted anymore. But it was already late and we couldn't go anywhere else now. With the last 3 groups remaining, they told us we had to order at the register because the kitchen was closing! Unbelievable! We've been waiting an hour and now you're telling order right there with menus in hands for 30 seconds? That's not our fault. We order hastily, get seated and the waiter hands us menus. Are you serious? We said they made us order at the front and so he took the menus back. After the drinks came out, we were asked if there's anything else we wanted because the kitchen was closing. What!? Why were were forced to order at the front then, when in those 10 minutes between sitting down and getting the drinks we could've gotten a better chance to look over the menu. No apologies, no comps, nothing. I love the food here, but the way we were treated was just plain BS."	1star
Do's: 1. Lamb chops  2. Shrimp linguine  3. Fish branzino  4. Michelada 5. Empanadas with Senegalese hot sauce    Dont's: I don't recommended the chicken sandwich. It was chargrilled to the point where it was tough dry and tasted burnt. The ciabatta bread was difficult to chew. French fries needed a pinch more of salt.  Enjoyed watching the World Cup match on the big (projector) screen.	3star
Made a reservation and we're seated quickly upon our arrival.  Took a bit of time try to decide on what to order. Enjoyed the fresh Italian bread as i tried to make up my mind.  I finally decided on the veal piccata. The veal was tender and delicious.  The restaurant decor was simple and very basic in a rougher part of town, but i would make the trek back to try something different. The pricing was very reasonable and the service was good.	4star
Hole in the wall, diamond in the rubble type of place. The food is amazing. Venue isn't all that but food makes up for it!  They don't usually ID for beer. Haha	5star
Came here on a Friday night to find a large crowd waiting out front. However, we only waited about twenty minutes before we were seated (as a party of two it wasn't too hard to do). Something to note, you will have to be assertive with the waitstaff, especially during busy times. I am lucky to have a partner who will do just that. However, the table next to us sat down when our first dishes were coming out and didn't order until we got our check.  We ordered a number of the best dishes including the Hainese chicken. However, my favorite was the pork belly with taro. It was sweet and starchy with fantastically soft pork belly.  The restaurant has an upscale feel with a high-density layout. Be ready for a large crowd but it is certainly worth while. Malaysian food is worth seeking out and is a good alternative to Chinatown and Little Italy nearby. I certainly recommend Nyonya.	4star
Excellent ramen. Worth the hype. The small dishes and apetizers are also very good. We had a sushi fish of uni and salmon for that we unbelievablely fresh and tasty.	4star
My visit was during brunch hours on a Saturday and was solely based on Thrillist rating Mesa Coyoacan's the Best Margaritas in Williamsburg. We ordered the strawberry and watermelon margaritas. It's served in a highball glass for $11and I honestly felt a tad ripped off.  The flavor wasn't impressive and in my opinion lacked alcohol--my novice liver would've noticed. I ordered the juevos ranchos special with salsa verde and rojo sauces and preferred the green sauce as it was well-seasoned and boosted the taste of their brunch special platter of steak which unfortunately lacked seasoning.  Our server was great and attentive to our needs but the flavor boost is needed for the margaritas and steak. With that said, I'll give them another try as it could've been an off day for the cook however sans the margaritas.	3star
Solid dinner. It was packed on a Tuesday at 7, but I guess that can be expected given the location. My 2 friends and I shared the Korean BBQ wings to start, which were delicious, and they each got flatbreads for their main, which they enjoyed. I got the Tavern burger, which comes with gorgonzola cheese and aioli, and to be honest I thought it was a little bland for such strong-tasting ingredients. I think it was the burger itself that just wasn't fantastic. That was the only let down though - the rest of the food was very good and the service was good.	4star
"There are a few things you can do to get an ""automatic 1,"" no matter how good your food. The Smith did just one of those things. What was it, pray tell? Read on, fair... uh, reader. We were looking for a ""light"" meal and had some brunch stuff. I had an eggs benedict and home fries, both pretty bland. Eggs benedict sauce didn't stand out, even though that's the best part of this dish typically.  On the plus side, the internal decor is nice. Lots of hustle and bustle, great if you like watching people interact with one another and feed off crowd energy, which I do. So why one star?! When I went to the bathroom, I saw a Smith staffer exit after using the restroom and NOT washing his hands. This was after I ate.  Maybe I should be glad the eggs benedict wasn't very ""rich."" Who knows what more ""extensive"" preparation might have done to the dish. I didn't get sick, and I did a Wardell ""Steph"" Curry index finger acknowledgment of my man, the Notorious G.O.D. GROSS!"	1star
"I went there for lunch on a beautiful summer day. Great space. Lots of light. Very airy. My and my two colleagues are greeted at the entrance by a smiling hostess. She greets us, turns around and walks into the restaurant. The she stops to chat with another hostess. And they chat. And chat. Until we realize that she never intended to seat us... Ok. We manage to get a table. Place is about half empty. Not too terribly busy. Service is a little bit on the slow side. But we manage to order three sandwiches. I take a Chicken Aioli Sandwich. And then the great wait begins. We literally wait 45 minutes. For a sandwich. During lunch. Only when I indicate to the waitress that we will have to leave soon (we are pedestrians who work for a living and don't have unlimited lunchtime) does the food eventually surface. My sandwich is a thin fried chicken cutlet with a heap of cole slaw on top. That's it. 14 bucks. I ordered it with a side salad and a side of fries. I get no salad. But two orders of fries. We wolf down the food because we really need to get back to work. However apparently nobody wants to take our money. I flag down three waiters. All three tell us they will send the appropriate person. After another 10 minutes or so I went up to the front counter and said ""here is the money, take it or leave it because I have to go"". The entire place seems terribly disorganized. The food is not worth the money."	1star
"Disappointed with this overhyped place. I am a big fan of ramen and have tried a lot of ramen in NYC but this place is just average ramen with very high price tag. Let's start with how salty the soup was. I had a sip and then poured half a glass of water into the bowl and it tasted a lot better.  The chashu pork was very fatty and wasn't cooked long enough. The meat doesn't really break apart in your mouth. I had to ""chew"" it. Soft boiled egg was for additional $2 dollars (what?!) but was good. Normally it comes with ramen but here they charge you for that on top of the expensive ramen. My bill came to around $21 including tax and tip for a bowl of overly salty ramen and not-so-good chashu? Try totto or momosan, they are much better."	3star
This is a NY MUST! Coming from the south, this is hands down some of the best chicken I've ever had. Their honey butter chicken biscuit sandwich is absolutely incredible. But come with an empty stomach! The portions are great for sharing!!!	5star
LOVE their food. I always get the joju sandwhich so tasty love it with the fresh jalapeno peppers. The kimchi fries are also to die for. Been here several times and they have always been fast and friendly with their service. I want to try the joju bowl downstairs too!	4star
New spot with convenient bus and train access! With a huge variety of craft beers and good food, you can't go wrong. I ordered an Alphabet City Easy Blonde Ale and then an Ithica Apricot Wheat, both good! Also ordered the Ridgewood BLT which had chipotle mayo AND pesto...uh-ma-zing (not to mention that it comes with French fries w/ a side of garlic aioli.) I highly recommend!! Super friendly and knowledgeable staff as well. With spacious and comfortable seating, I will definitely be coming back!	5star
Ordered the bacon appetizer which was crispy tender and juicy with just the right amount of salt sweet flavor.  Loved it.  Ordered the Porterhouse for 3 persons - medium rare.  It came on a very hot plate which unfortunately made the steak medium well done during the final stage of the meal.  Also had the fries cooked in tallow - nice crisp outside and tender interior.  Spinach was bland.  $300 for 3 persons, which included tax and tip.	3star
Brought my birthday twin yesterday for lunch. It was his first visit and he thoroughly enjoyed it. We ordered broiled Fillet and grilled Calamari with beets and lemon potatoes. Everything was on point! Delicious as always.	5star
"Brunch in Brooklyn on Sunday + Mother's Day 2017 = one hour wait but worth the taste, sense the flavor of American cuisine.  One hour wait, at the bar counter, going solo as an independent spirit was no exception to the wait.  My bill states ""solo"" for one guest.  I am weary from a hard and difficult work week but my spirit was strong, positive and unbreakable with great defense.  I search for a deeper meaning in life as I continue this journey.  Upon my departure I overheard from a patron who was standing outside waiting ""the wait is two hours"" as getting here early is a greater chance for a lesser wait.  Buttermilk Channel has a country feel, cozy phlegmatic ambiance which is very bright, homey during the daytime of white wall panels and exposed brick.  I can imagine be it very intimate for couples at night.  Customer service and hospitality is attentive and professional.  The hostess was very informative and kept cool to triage the wait and new arrivals in an orderly matter with a tablet.  Brunch classic staples as eggs Benedict, chicken and waffles, French Toast, rib hash, hash browns, fries are offered and, of course, Mimosa and Bellini.  Buttermilk Channel modified the classics by upgrading chicken and waffles with cheddar waffles and fried pork chops covered in maple syrup while poached eggs, biscuit, ham and Hollandaise are a delicious upgrade to the traditional eggs Benedict. Pecan Pie French Toast $13 - Bourbon, molasses and toasted pecans A southern version of bread pudding which I believed it tasted spiked with bourbon and sweetened with molasses topped with toasted pecans.  The bread was harden on the outside which my knife was unable to cut through. The toast is pie shaped of triangle dimension.  There are no fresh fruit accompanied with this entrée. Hash browns $5 - an addition of two round slightly burnt hash browns with ketchup accompanied.  The inner potato filling was comforting. Bellini $10 - perfect pairing for brunch. One unisex facility is available for the entire business, thus watch your time and be mindful of the line.  All major credit cards are accepted.  Business cards are available and pstrons receive a comment card to make any critical comments as well as the option to be on their email list.  Buttermilk Channel is refines brunch where folks flock to respond the calling.  Come for the biscuits, come for the French toast, come for the eggs - stay for a quality meal."	4star
We stopped at Almar for brunch on a Saturday while looking for an alternative spot to Atrium, due to the really long wait. I like the layout and decor of Almar. It's very inviting. We started at the bar, grabbing a cocktail while we waited. The menu is quite interesting and the cocktails we tried were all tasty. I especially like the New Fashioned, different take on a classic. After a short wait, we were seated and ordered. For brunch we had the Burger and the Eggs in a Cloud. Both were good, tasty and the presentation were very nice, especially the Eggs in a Cloud, which prepred egg whites in a way I have never seen before. You may be asking why I didn't score this higher? Well, while everything looked nice, nothing blew us away flavor wise. It was all very tasty, but I think we were expecting more in terms of flavors. Nothing was bad, just nothing was amazing. Since they are Italian themed, we may come back here for dinner to try out their proper faire. When I do, I will update this review then. Other things of note, Almar is actually rather reasonable price wise and the staff are great. If you happen to be in DUMBO and looking for a chill spot to have a bit, Almar is a good place to check out.	3star
Been here for brunch and dinner, left happy every time. Egg sandwich is amazing(!) and very well priced! Huevos rancheros great, as well. Pesto mashed potatoes, broccoli, pulled pork, everything is very good. Haven't tried many of their cocktails but the blueberry fizz (or whatever it is named) is delish. Huge menu that carnivores, veggies, and vegans alike could all be satisfied. Three stars for the less than stellar delivery and crowds at brunch.	3star
"I think I've had some pretty good XLB in my life, but nothing was as good as joes crab and pork XLB. My bf and I were making our way through all the popular dining spots in NYC, and we stopped by there for a mid afternoon ""snack"". First, the size of the dumplings are ridiculously big. Second, the juice inside was so flavorful. Next time I'm in NYC, I'll be coming here for XLB and other things!"	5star
Great value Ramen, but get there early. We lined up in the rain at 4:40pm Christmas eve and got straight in when they opened at 5pm. Food was delicious and not expensive	5star
"Holy cannoli I can not believe I have lived 15-20 minutes away from this place since forever and I haven't ever eaten here. Vegetarian egg roll x2- super crispy and delicious egg roll definitely not the crappy egg rolls you come across on the day to day it's loaded with flavorful and yummy veggies. Loaded JoJu Bánh Mì Fries w/bulgogi- I don't even know where to begin as I can't stop thinking about it. Sure maybe my tastebuds were enhanced because I hadn't eaten anything but a piece of toast, but was it really just my desperate tastebuds ?? Nah because even when I was so full I wanted to die I wanted every last bit. The ratios are excellent and it's just so well put together it's really magical and spiritual. The fries are perfectly crispy with the lovely shredded and delicates veg a yummy fried egg cooked to perfection with a supple and runny yolk and then the bulgogi just took it to heaven along with the delicate and perfect sprinkles of sauce, hot peppers and cilantro this dish is my ideal food. I can't talk about it anymore cause I will wait till the food settles and be back again.  #7 vegetarian ham with a runny egg - super flavorful and full of depth with the right amount of spice, if you have a bit of trouble with spice I'd say maybe It's a no go but my sweet Latino vegetarian husband was widdit. The bread was crunchy and the ""ham"" tasted and looked like ham to the point that my husband began to question if it was too good to be true. Point is this place does sexy, dirty, magical things. Flan -guaoooo, more witchcraft this flan was perfect not too sweet and the caramel sexiness it comes in is not burnt but delicately bitter and it's just a perfect combo, clearly they are flavor wizards. Frozen Vietnamese coffee- My husband died for this he loved the delicate coffee flavors and the creaminess he also loved that they asked if he wanted whipped cream. My man never turns town whipped cream or a caffeinated beverage he's a coffee slut. 10 out of 10 would eat here again, maybe even tomorrow? Don't tempt me!!  Great service with lines practically out the door. The space is small but if there's a seat and you have a second take a seat and live a little.  The wait time was so minimal it was truly a magical experience. EAT HERE."	5star
Hidden Jem....off the beaten path to some extent. Amazing food for taste and presentation. I recommend going with the chief selection 100%. Let them choose or add to it.	5star
My assessment is based on the average of all the elements of a dining experience. My brother, whose review is further below, was more generous than I am. It was a disgusting meal and I wish I could give them 0 stars. This is a real shame because we live a few blocks away and dine out often in Forest Hills.  Ambience: 1 star - I like the exposed brick, wood, big windows/doors. I HATED how loud it was - 8 p.m. on a Thursday night, sitting right by the open door and I still couldn't hear my mom who was sitting in the chair next to me. Couldn't hear what my brother or sister in law were saying to me across a four-top. After 10 minutes of raising her voice to be heard, my mom just stopped talking because the shouting was too much of an effort. Service: 0 stars - We got to the restaurant and were seated around 7:40. Our app arrived at 8. Our mains? 8:45. It took 1 hour from being seated to having my main course? Around half hour after our app arrived, our waitress finally came to check on us. She asked how we were doing. I said, I'd like to have my dinner? Where is it? That's when she realized we had been sitting there with no food on our table for some time. She went to check on our food and returned to tell us it was coming immediately. 10 minutes later our dinners finally showed up.  I had ordered a burger and traditionally at a sitdown non-counter service restaurant my experience is that the server will ask how I'd like the meat cooked. She didn't ask, which I didn't realize until 30 minutes later. So I assumed maybe this restaurant only prepares burger one way. When a manager (Mark) came to apologize for the slow service, I asked whether I was supposed to be able to choose the doneness of said burger. Apparently I was supposed to have been asked. So between not being served food in a timely manner +the forgetful waitress   (0 stars) and two managers coming over to apologize and offer us a dessert (1 star), the score averaged to a 0.5, skewing to 0 on account of the overall failure to provide the main service of a restaurant, ie feed the customer the food they want.   Food: a solid 0 stars. Of all culinary outings in my home borough, this was the worst meal I'd ever had in Queens. My review is only based on what I ate/tasted, though my mom will tell you that the pulled pork shoulder was the most disgusting thing she'd ever eaten. We ordered the poutine app, which arrived more like disco fries. Shoestring fries with melted cheese on top and way too much BBQ sauce. Doesnt poutine involve thick cut fries, gravy and cheese curds? Please don't call this a poutine, because it is an insult to real poutine.  Way too much sauce is a recurring theme here. I got the lamb burger, which as I mentioned I did not get to specify as medium rare. What I got was an overcooked extremely dry lamb patty with a lot of sauce on it. I couldn't actually taste lamb; I just tasted the saltiness of the sauce. (similar to the so-called poutine; it just tasted like I was eating BBQ sauce on top of melted cheese) The side salad was overdressed with a thick creamy dressing. That too was overly salty. From my experience, when one orders a salad instead of a side of fries, it is usually to reap a health benefit. I felt I was eating salad dressing with a side of leaves. I am mostly vegetarian so I am incline to eat all the vegetables in a meal. I couldn't finish my side salad because I was too overloaded with dressing, even after I tried to wipe it off the sides of the plate. As I mentioned, a manager offered to compensate the poor service with a free dessert. Before any of this had happened, I had been excited to try the smores dessert. But after that poutine and the main course, I couldn't bear to continue to torture myself with more food from this kitchen. I was swelling up from all the salt I'd just eaten, and I was bloated from all the water that I drank during the meal to wash down the saltiness. I can't imagine what one of their desserts could have done to me. At this point, I just wanted to go home and forget this whole dinner ever happened.  For the record, I had been meaning to try this place since it opened in July but I thought I'd wait it out for a few months for the opening kinks to work themselves out. At this point, issues like staff training and kitchen scheduling/food preparation should have been resolved. So I am going to take this as a sign that this restaurant has problems beyond opening hiccups and decline to return, especially since there's plenty of similar bar-food choices within walking distance. We would have had better burgers and better, faster service at Shake Shack, and at half the price.	1star
"Dined here recently with a party of 4. The food and atmosphere are excellent, but we had some service issues. We arrived a little late for our reservations but grabbed a drink at the bar. Not really much in beer selection, but not surprising for an Italian restaurant. The girls in our party loved the Italian Sangria. Service issues started when our server approached the table and asked us a question and we asked if he was our server and the response ""Last time I checked I was"". No introductions, not personable at all. Second, he messed up the order. We ordered a fritto misto appetizer, and he brought something else. Luckily the antipasto platter he brought was good and we were hungry and we didn't complain...plus how could we have, he disappeared. Our service was done quite efficiently and professionally by the two bus boys who were helping the ""server"". Looking around the room the other servers seemed nice, we may have just gotten the dud. Again, food was great and I would recommend it from that standpoint, but hopefully you don't get our server."	3star
The place was nice and the food and drinks were good, but the service was truly awful. It baffles me that so much would be spent on the fit out and rent but not invest in staff. They seemed overworked and not a single item was delivered in an acceptable timeframe and we had to follow up on all requests, including getting our credit cards back. There must be other businesses nearby that don't treat their customers as an inconvenience.	2star
Where to begin. I looked up this restaurant on yelp and decided to give it a shot since some of the items on the menu sounded good. We arrived at about 5:30 and were promptly seated. We sat for about 10-15 minutes and it got to the point where we had to order our drinks from the bus boy because our server had not showed up. We asked for a sample of their red sangria, which was delicious, only to order a pitcher of it and it tasted nothing like the sample. watered down taste. Strike 1. We ordered our food and basically got two orders of the same thing, churrasco with truffle fries and as an app, a choclo. Choclo (grilled corn on the cob) was good, came out prompt. one order of the churrasco came out. We waited a few minutes for the second order to come out. waited. waited. Second order never came out. Our server, which by this time had changed, asked us what we needed and we politely told her we were waiting for our second churrasco. She diligently ran to back as to check on it. Apparently the kitchen had ignored that order. So we waited.. and waited. finally after like 15-20 minutes we just decided to get the check and the server was shocked that the churrasco had still not come out. Strike 2. She apologized and gave us a free flan, which we appreciated because we know that it wasn't her fault. The choclo was good, with it's cotija cheese and chipotle sauce. The churrasco, the one we luckily had, was tasteless and uneventful. The flan, was way too cold and because of it didn't allow the tastebuds to really taste and enjoy.	1star
A solid four rating. The burger got the job done but I definitely wouldn't put it in my top five. Happy hour had a great selection and prices.  Food was a bit overpriced. Ambiance is cool and the bartender was super friendly.  Tip:  stick to happy hour	4star
THIS IS NOT A RESTAURANT. This is a bar that serves over priced appetizers. You're better served going to a nice tapas place like CATA instead. Do you like steak? How about paying $56 for 6-7 small pieces of beef tenderloin smothered in a mountain of fries, served with 8 scallion pancakes and topped off with under cooked rice at the end? Everything up until the entrée came out was pretty good. We expected the place to expensive, but we enjoyed the 2 skewers we had (squid and chicken thigh). We were told they had a special tonight, and their special was a GROUND BEEF EMPANADA! That's it! That was the only special!?! The drinks we had were good, but they were $12-$14 for small cocktails. The décor was ok, but the bar is huge. Small tables line the windows because there is simply not enough space to seat big parties.  The server came over to our table to ask how things were, and I said everything was pretty good up until the entrée. We had some serious issues with it. He said your problem is my problem and I will get the manager to come over and help. The pretentious manager came over to try and explain it was high quality beef and how the chef butchers it himself. Great, but you can't tell me if the beef is grass fed? Organic? Wagyu? Angus? She kept repeating herself about the quality of the beef, but couldn't give specifics. Look at the menu, the first ingredient of the dish is Beef Tenderloin...shouldn't that mean the main portion of the dish is beef? She started to explain the dish was Lomo Saltado...I cut her off. I've had Lomo Saltado many a times and if this what they think Lomo is, or if the chef is Peruvian, then they should be ashamed. She started talking about the chef's vision and the ambience and how that is part of the price...Bitch, please. The chef's vision is to rip you off, and the ambience? Do you mean the view of the underpass of the BQE and row houses across the street? She left and the General Manager came over he explained that each dish is portioned out to 10-12 ounces of beef. I then asked him why is that not specified on the menu? (Because if it was, no one would order it!) They comped us the beef dish and brought out the short rib to appease us. We gave the wait staff a good tip because the service was good. They asked us to come again and we said we wouldn't.	1star
Came here on our dinner crawl anniversary night with the wife, trying to satisfy our Italian food cravings. Ordered: Bruschetta Bone Marrow - I was super excited to try some of their bone marrow which sounded so good in my head but was a bit disappointed with the actual flavors (somewhat bland). I expected so much more richness but it just fell a bit flat on the bruschetta.  Pistachio Pesto - The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the pistachio really complimented the pesto in the dish. The portion size was a bit on the smaller side IMHO (esp for a $20+ pasta) but the flavors and technique really shined. All in all a good spot to sit for dinner/drinks and people watch in Little Italy. Plenty of seating inside and out (weather permitting).	3star
Adrienne was our Friday cheat day lunch place for the last 7 years when I worked in FiDi...  before I ventured to Chelsea... I will never forget the beautiful semi burnt crust, the fresh sweet tomato, sauce and delicious toppings or just Margherita style old fashion... (Add arugula! Mmm...)  Always friendly, efficient and their tray pizza is always on point.  We never had any issues and even for a large group of 6, we usually do the smart thing by heading out early before the lunch rush or simply call ahead for a table (they will always try to accommodate).  I do sometimes wish it would be easier to eat with hands vs. a knife & fork... It's the Brooklyn in me... LOL $24 will get you a tray to share, and if adding toppings, might run up to $44 for lunch w/ 2 sodas.  Great for Sharing!  Happy Pizza Everyday!	4star
"Ehhh. Was really disappointed by this place. Went on the 4th of July with really high hopes of having a cool meal with close friends. The service was mediocre at best. They gave us dirty utensils that still had food on them. I told the waitress that my utensils were dirty and she told me ""No they're not, I cleaned them myself."" Like really!!! I mean I'm seeing the food on them. Eventually we got new utensils and then was the arrival of our food. Presentation was excellent. Their food photographs so well. I ordered the Hot Chicken sandwich with mac & Cheese. I did emphasize hot chicken right? I thought that it was supposed to be in the Nashville style of Hot Chicken, but this was just a seasoning powder thrown onto the chicken that wasn't even hot! It was a HOT chicken sandwich that wasn't hot.  Then the actual chicken was dark meat! I think restaurants should let you know when the chicken sandwiches they serve are not white meat. So frustrating. The sandwich wasn't even juicy, so whats the point of serving dry, dark meat. *Shakes head* I strongly doubt that i'll be returning here."	3star
"Ella? Should be called ""the waiters ass"" because it's surely to be in your face through out your meal.  Decent food, sub-par cocktail, lively atmosphere, could use more than 4 inches between each table."	3star
"Definitely agree with some other reviewers. I'm not sure about the claim by one other reviewer about being ""racist"" but I'm sort of feeling the same way thinking that restaurant has attitude somewhat. I could be wrong, but don't know. My job here to write what I've experienced. We were first-time travelers to Brooklyn planning to have that awesome Brooklyn pizza for the first time in life so we had no idea about the menu or how topping prices and system work. The problem is the lady by the entrance who takes the orders. She was so impatient when my wife wanted to add a topping and not respectful or whatsoever at all. It was one of the worst customer service I've ever had. I had to tell her that we are paying customers and we could be confused and asking some questions and she needed to be patient especially at that time no one was behind us. I understand that she could be tired because this non-stop orders thru out the day and that's not my problem. Owner should hire another person if one person can not handle, right? No need to treat us like 2nd class citizen. The restaurant is right next to the harbor where the tourist arrive on boats. Most tourists are from China so they might have hard time ordering and understanding the menu.The restaurant might think that they are so established and have enough business and leverage not to give a s*hit to those tourists because no matter there will be a line because ""everyone, who is first timer is excited to try Brooklyn pizza"" right? But the truth is the this place and the one next door are totally counting on these tourists that they are treating them like s*hit, IMO and we were one of them. I actually doubt that locals would come to this place.  So the first part of placing the order was horrendous. However when the pizza arrived, it blew our minds. My wife who is not into pizza was super stoked and all my angers and madness were just melted and vaporized. Pizza was big, colorful, and I actually give lots of credits to those guys next to the oven made this incredible pizza happened. They got my hi-five. The lady, zero. For the reason- the great pizza, I've added two stars to to this review. Sorry that's all I can afford."	2star
Well, this was rather underwhelming. First of all, everyone is so packed in here like sardines that waiters literally need to pull out the tables in order for one to get in. The whole restaurant is basically a community table in the loudest way possible. Service was also rather mediocre, probably because of the sheer amount of people in there. On to the food: escargots were rather tasty but hard to eat as you need to pick them out with a tooth pick (meh), the pate was pretty good I'd say although it was more like a mousse than a true pate. For the entrees, my mom ordered a shrimp pasta, which was bland and used the cheapest salad shrimp known to man. 100% not worth the money. My chicken with a frise salad was ok, great for my diet but tasted like it. The best thing we had were the cheeseburgers. Not worth the trip, the effort, or the money, just for good cheeseburgers. Major pass.	2star
"The pictures confused me because I thought this was a brunch place I visited years ago. The service was fine except for when my boyfriend asked for extra napkins.  The waiter gave him two and my boyfriend asked for more.  The waiter says, ""why, did you spill something?"" -_- I was able to eat my eggs benedict because I was starving.  The food barely looked edible and they even forgot my home fries.  I was done eating by the time I realized. Only plus was the strong enough drink to help me forget my decision to come here."	1star
4.5 Gluten Free - Yes-- Verify items Casein Free- Yes- verify items Trattoria Treecolori is one of my favorite Italian restaurants to dine at in NYC pre/post a Broadway Show. What it has going for it: + Gluten free pasta substitute - their GF noodles taste great. The actually have flavor and are not overly salty.  + Cross Contamination - they did a really good job handling CC to ensure that it didn't occur + Price - fair for the quality and quantity that you are given. I usually end up with two meals + Drinks - strong and what you would expect to pay else where Con's : - This place can get loud and extremely loud during peak times - If your dinning at the small bar in the main dinning room, it can get tight, especially if there are people waiting to be seated since it is a really small space between that and the entrance Tip: Want to ensure that get enjoy a tasty meal here? Make sure you have a reservation, which you will need to call to make.	4star
Was looking for a spot to have quick lunch and this spot was recommended. It appeared to have the traditional homey atmosphere of the older Chinese establishments and the food and everything else matched! I ordered the hot pot, which was actually excessively HOT and took a few minutes longer than I expected to arrive.  I opted for chicken, which was OK, but nothing special really.  The rice had various levels, depending how close it was to the hot pot interior. I got the soft rice to the crunchy rice on the pot, and it was an adventure.  I needed to use some sauces to get more flavor into the dish, which I expected... Overall a good experience.  Would go back to do noodles.	3star
Burger & Lobster definitely lived up to my expectations.  Had a lunch date with the hubby here and it did not disappoint.  Cocktails were interesting and well made.  Service was very attentive and friendly. And, last but certainly not least... the food was so tasty!  I had the burger & lobster combo.  It was sooooo good!  I really liked the mixed sesame seed crust on the burger buns.  It added an unexpected but welcomed crunch.  The lobster was grilled just right with a nice lemon garlic butter sauce on the side.  Definitely a place to try.	5star
Four stars for the royal pad Thai and decor! When you walk into the dining area, the decoration really is such a beautiful sight. We were seated in a booth which was comfortable and spacious for 3 people.  The menu is intimidating. There are different sections with starters, entrees, etc. in each. Actually when we were ordering my one friend ordered a curry. My other gasped saying she didn't even see curry as an option (behind a fold of the menu) so we needed more time before we could order!  We started with the papaya salad with shrimp. This was very tasty - on par with any other papaya salad I've had but the shrimp were stand out! Split and grilled - very tasty. We also got the crispy catfish salad. Meh at best. Where was the catfish?? It was just gross crispy breading, which we ate around (although there was a ton of it). We asked the waitress and she said it was supposed to be like that. Pass.  I ordered the royal pad Thai as my main. It was incredible. I was really hungry and finished the whole thing, but it wasn't as enormous of a portion as you typically get. The noodles were thin and perfectly cooked. The seafood was delicious. My friends enjoyed their panang curry and chicken stir fry as well!	4star
"I live in the neighborhood and stop in from time to time. The food is pretty good but the service is horrible. I've been meaning to write a review about this place for a while but stopping in for lunch today certainly motivated me to do so.  You always wait here, no matter what. You wait 20 mins for the waiter to bring your drinks no matter what you order. From a Bloody Mary to a soda, you wait. You wait for the food, sometimes 20-30 mins. Never ever come here in a rush. Last, you wait for your check. You can be finished eating and wait 30 mins for the check, even if you ask for it.  Today I stopped it alone to grab a bite to eat at the bar. There were 4 bar stools available on a Friday afternoon and 3 tables. There was no hostess so I sat myself down. I was told by the female waitress they were ""not ready yet"" and they would be with me in a minute. So I walked back up front and yup! You guessed it...Waited!  I waited there for 5 more mins while I stared at the empty stools and tables. The waitress then walks back up to me and tells me it will be 5-10 mins because they have some things to do. To be seated???? Are you fucking kidding me? This place is a joke. I'm writing this review from Saraghina around the block while I eat my lunch.  Pathetic. Fire 80% of your staff and start over. It's a shit show"	2star
Overhyped and terrible service, overall just so-so.  I will start with the food first on the off-chance that service was a fluke. My boyfriend and I got the yakitori skewers, omu soba, katsudon.  For drinks we got the Take Me Home, Kimitachi Kiwi, and frozen beer.  Standouts are the omu soba and the Kimitachi Kiwi.  Disappointments are the yakitori skewers and frozen beer. Yakitori Skewers - Disappointing.  Quantity was disappointingly small for the price.  The pictures showed 3 meatballs and 3 peppers but we only got 2 of each.  Did they decide to skip out because we were only two people?  It also tasted nothing special.  It was just normal grilled meat. Omu Soba - Not bad, but then again anything smothered in okonomoyaki sauce and mayo is not bad.  A very generous serving of soba covered in an egg omelette topped with bonito flakes.  The egg was tender and soba tasted fine. The pork in the soba was overcooked and very tough though.  Good if you're craving carbs. Katsudon - Again, nothing special.  Could have used more sauce to give it more flavor. Take Me Home - Okay but way too sweet.  Again, nothing mind blowing but we could taste a lot of alcohol in there which was reassuring. Kimitachi Kiwi - Really liked this cocktail actually.  It tasted very fresh and was not cloyingly sweet.  A bit sour but in a good way. Frozen beer - Just beer with more beer on top of it.  What's the hype? Service - The katsudon came at the very least 30 minutes after everything else.  We had to ask the waitress twice and both times she pointed towards the kitchen and said it would be right there.  We did get an apology at the end though, which I appreciate.  However, then they also forgot to return my boyfriend's credit card to him after he paid which is highly suspicious. I would definitely not come here again on my own.  But if my friends were to decide to come here, I wouldn't vehemently oppose it either.	3star
My friend was determined to take me here as it's apparently just something you have to try at least once if you live in New York. While deciding to dine here may be an easy choice, securing a reservation is another story. They take reservations on the first day of the month for seatings in the following month. For example, if your wanted to dine in January, it's best if you call on December 1st at 10 AM (when they open) for the greatest chance of getting a table at the time and date you want.  The day of our reservation, we were running late. They have a 15 minute grace period. After that, they will try to work with you but there are no guarantees. When we did get to the restaurant, we waited another 20 minutes or so to be seated. We decided to share the following: -1 slice of Lugar's sizzling bacon ($6.50): I was the least excited about this, but it exceeded my expectations. It was the perfect balance of smoky, crispy, chewy, juicy, fatty, and meaty. It's a must get!  -Steak for two ($108): (1) I love that they tilt the plate to get all the drippings to one side. (2) I love that the waiter serves each person two pieces - one from each side of the T-bone. (3) I love that huge gravy boat full of Peter Lugar sauce. It's not like the steak needs it, but a side of steak sauce is always welcome.  -Creamed spinach ($12): Creamed spinach is my favorite steak side. Peter Lugar does it super well! It's very green and smooth and it doesn't taste like a spoonful of cream.  -Onion rings ($13): After seeing and smelling all the plates of onion rings, we caved and ordered them. However, it was my least favorite dish of the night. The onion rings were quite oily and got soggy rather quickly. I would pass on this.  Peter Lugar is often overhyped. Depending on your expectations, it can be disappointing. I was not blown away by the steak or the sides, but everything was very good from the service to the food (minus the onion rings). As a New York institution, it is surely sustaining on consistency and quality and not on innovation.	4star
Service wasn't very good nor very attentive. The pasta was very well done but the food in general was very ordinary.	2star
This place is delicious.  (Except for their water, which tastes like dirty soap water.  I actually think I got an upset stomach from drinking this water alone. Just don't drink the water.  I told them about this, and asked for a second glass just to see if it was 'normal'.) That being said, everything else here was delicious!  We tried the truffled clam mac & cheese, tuna, steak, chicken, eel tacos, and kale.  I'd definitely return for the clam mac & crispy chicken!  I'd pass on the overly soggy fried soft shell crab. Their light-up cocktails are hilarious. There's no way to not be happy drinking one, and the service is wonderful.	4star
I had a good time at district. it was a Saturday night and crowded at this place. however, they sat us right away because they have tables in the back behind the packed bar. I ordered a craft beer and my wife ordered a wine. the wine came immediately but I had to wait an extra 10 minutes or so for my beer. I don't know why. I ordered the lamb dish because I love lamb and was craving lamb from a street cart earlier that day. when it came it tasted fine but wasn't what I expected. it was more of a soup dish with Indian flavors. I totally ate every thing and enjoyed it but I wouldn't of ordered it of I knew it was like a hearty soup with Indian flavors.	3star
Very nice service and beautiful interior decorations! Quite a few sits and walking distance to bus stops or subway stations. Great food and decent drinks. Don't usually need reservations and the attire is casual so it's nice. Fresh ingredients and nice space.	4star
I am deathly allergic to shellfish and informed our server. First, he brought me the wrong dish and did not realize for several moments that it was not what I ordered. Then he brought out the dish I had ordered and after 15 minutes of eating it, he came back and took it away because it had oyster sauce. I had to wait another 30 minutes for my meal. Everyone at the table had finished eating. When the check came, the waiter had charged me for two meals. When we asked him to take both off, and he refused. After arguing with him that it is completely inappropriate to charge for a meal that could have killed me, he reluctantly took it off. However, when he gave us our final bill, he had added 20% gratuity for himself, claiming that he had forgotten to add the gratuity the last two times he brought us the check. This was the worst service I have ever experienced and definitely will not be coming back.	1star
Place is smaller than expected. Food was good. Drinks were not that good. Friendly staff. Is a little pricey.	4star
"In the style of gas stations scattered across Italy, this pasta and panini place is a quick, low-key stop focused on getting you full. I went in knowing this was fast-casual, but also hoping that the ingredients and execution would make this fit into the Little Italy neighborhood.. My friends and I had the wine cocktail ($8ish) vodka and pesto pasta ($11/12 per bowl), a side of beef & pork meatballs ($6 for 2) and the oven fresh ciabatta ($2 for 4 sticks of bread). The cocktail, their take on aperol spritz, was refreshing! The pasta was actually really good, the portions were large. It didn't blow me away with quality though. The meatballs were actually delicious but only included 2, which I thought was kind of a rip off. Then the bread was cold. I went up to clarify and they're ""oven fresh as of this morning, not oven fresh when you order.""  Overall, this is the equivalent of a super cute dollar slice spot surrounded by delicious wood fried pizza. As long as you know what you're getting, it's not bad."	3star
Their oven baked chicken is great but it's not really impressive as it was advertised. No doubt about the Williamsburg price, it's even more pricy than Mid town Manhattan, but trend comes first, then food quality	3star
I have to update this, I wish I could stick with 4-5 stars, but the taste is too hit or miss. Got Pad See Ew last night and there was no flavor at all. Crispy wings are always good, sometimes oil tastes a little old. excited to see these guys continue to improve.	3star

I've been here at least 3 or 4 times and every single time I've encountered a rude, impatient, poor attitude hostess. Seriously, I can't make it up how rude they've been every single time. If you can get past the crappy attitude of the hostess' when you walk through the door, you're in for a real treat. The food here is AMAZING!  The Mac & Cheese is to die for and the chicken & waffles are second to none. The severs are very attentive and make sure you're well taken care of.  I wasn't that fond of their biscuit, but everything else I've had has been great.  I would give them 5 stars but the attitudes of the hostess during each visit force me to leave 4 stars.	4star
The BBQ is great - brisket not too fatty, turkey not dry, collards have great flavor, ribs are yummy. Did not care for the lamb belly - too much fat for my taste - but it's quite popular. Prices are pretty reasonable for BBQ in Brooklyn. My big complaint about Hometown, and hence the 4 stars (and I seriously contemplated going down to 3, but the food is too good), is their system. You order and wait for the food (unless you have a special order that gets brought to your table), and they don't take the next order until you've been served. As a result, the line moves super slow and goes out the door. Be prepared to wait upwards of an hour on a busy day. And it's hot!! I can't for the life of me figure out why it's not place an order, get a number, and move to the side or have a runner deliver the food, unless it is to allow tables to continually open up.	4star
So good, especially the drunken fish soup and fisherman's stew. Loved the crispy fried rice. Personable owner. You cannot order too much -- it's all too tasty. Reasonable prices. Great for groups so you can try everything (we numbered 8, paid about 0 each and ate and drank very very well).	5star
3.5 stars. Visited for the first time this summer, mainly because of the soup dumplings (xiao long bao). There are 2 varieties to choose from, pork and crab meat. The XLB here are massive. Probably double in size in comparison to any of the others I have tried. The pork XLB were delicious and finished quickly. My group did not enjoy the crab meat XLB however. The crab meat itself was good but the soup inside these dumplings were a seafood broth which was not that enjoyable. The next time I'd definitely get multiple orders of the pork XLB.  The other dishes we had were standard fare - chicken fried rice, stir fried beef with green peppers, all were tasty and came in large, filling portions.  Came here on a Saturday for lunch and although there was a line, it took about 15-20 minutes to seat a group of 4. Will return for more XLB!	3star
Come for the trend and drinks, not for the food. Packed for brunch means having strangers seated at your small table mid-meal, food that shows up at random times for different guests that is over cooked at best and some food that never shows up but is still coming forty five minutes later. If you ask nicely they won't charge you for the food they never served you.	1star
Made reservations here going on the Yelp reviews. A walk-in would have been ok as well. The place was huge and hence didnt seem as packed but there were a lot of people. My friend and I reached there about 9.30 and were shown to our table pretty immediately. We ordered a drink each and some roasted cauliflower tacos to start. They were delicious. We should have gotten another of those. But we wanted to try the Arugula flatbread so opted for that instead. That was delicious too. Not too cheesy which was what we wanted. Not too pricey. If you want a chill evening to chat and catch up with friends, this is a good spot. Not too noisy. Service is quick and spacious so you get your privacy. I wish they had a couple of more vegetarian items on the menu, especially since their chef seems to know the right mix of things to create a meal for the veggie palatte. Definitely going back. Oh and we just ordered some wine and cider as we didnt want to drink too much but i believe the cocktails are delicious so will be trying a couple next time around.	4star
The four foot something Korean girl that's a hostess (with yellow hair) is shockingly rude and ruined my experience here. Even if I'm having a bad day, I never take it out on the customers. I asked a simple question and she scoffed, ignoring me and storming off. I tried to talk to her twice and the same rude response. I'm done with this place. If she doesn't like her job, then she needs to quit or get fired. Tough. You lost a frequent weekend customer for good.	1star
Really Delicious Pizza!  We got the Bulina I think.  They make their own pizza!  Highly recommend.	5star
Simply amazing New York pizza. They don't sell by the slice, so sigh, it was up to me and my husband to attempt to finish an entire pizza. We failed in that effort, but we made an excellent attempt. We got the half red, half white pizza, and I just can't say enough good things about it. Perfect crust, perfect sauce, perfect cheese, and the perfect ratio of each of those yummy components. So happy that this was the place that we selected for our New York pizza experience.	5star
O.M.G. this place is the bomb!  We came here for my bday dinner small party of 6 and of course we got that table in the middle where the chandelier is :) Food= hands down one of my favorite place for pasta now Must try= Gnocchi Di Ricotta, Mezzelune Alla Boscaiola, Anello Di Capesante E Speck (scallop), Petto D'anatra (duck) ~ try all these and thank me later :p It was soooo good we ordered all of them twice  Drink= Ask them to recommend you some red/white wine.. of course you get to try it first So far they recommendation were pretty on point Or ask anything from the bar, they got full bar Service= Good, quick and they know what they are talking about as far as food and drink Fabio is the man! Look for Fabio. Decor= very vintage looking, not a big place so it gets pack and loud at times To confirm all of the aspects, I went there again the second time. No occasion it was just a regular dinner.. and yes same experience all over again. This place deserves 5 stars. Keep it up Uva! til next time...	5star
I live in Los Angeles so I guess I am spoiled but no sane Mexican place will ever put ground beef in a burrito let alone 2 types of rice. It was a huge burrito filled with tasteless slop. And can I say overpriced? I got a salad and burrito to go and it cost me 30 bucks. No way ho brah your food sucks. Salsas were shit too and that's really how you know a good Mexican place	1star
Red Hook Lobster Pound is just swell. They were badly affected by Hurricane Sandy, but the owners used it as an opportunity to renovate their space and offer a more full dining experience. To that end, it looks like they've definitely succeeded. We were able to just walk in on a Sunday night and grab a table. Our waitress apologized for the wait, even though it was literally 20 seconds. Started out with some beers and a cup of the New England chowder, which was possibly the best I've had since I was in Boston years ago. Their beer selection is also pretty good. Lots of crafts. We wanted to do the oysters Rockafella, but sadly, they were sold out for the day. Also sold out of the peel and eat shrimp. Sad face. Oh well, that just meant we had to get more lobster! We split the lobster mac and cheese. The lobster chunks were oh so plentiful. With some fresh pepper from the grinder, it was perfect. For my lobster roll, I went with Connecticut style. So buttery, with giant chunks of fresh, meaty lobster. About as good as it gets. The slaw on the side was decent, and I opted for potato salad, which was pretty good. Of course, no review of the newly renovated Lobster Pound would be complete without reviewing the bathroom in the back. It's big and round, with a beach umbrella mounted to the ceiling, three beach cots on the ground, and mirrors all around (kind of like the funhouse sort). Definitely the coolest bathroom I've been to in recent memory (and I like bathrooms). Stop by and show these guys some love!	5star
A jewel in lower Manhattan. Reasonably  priced. Great food.	5star
"I really wanted to love this place, but the fact is I would never eat here again because of the undercooked/ill-prepared food.  My friends and I came here on a Friday night at around midnight after a show nearby.  We expected it to be packed, but it was rather empty.  It's a large space, cute and interesting.  The bar offered a decent beer selection and the outside provides plenty of tables to gather with a large group comfortably.  The food was nearly finished with only a few menu items still available.  We basically had the choice between the ""whole hog"" (plate or a la carte) or the chicken legs.  I opted for the whole hog plate, which came with a rather tasty cole slaw and a pile of random pork products.  It was a mixture of pulled pork bits and then pork rinds.  Honestly, the pork didn't taste of anything really.  Just greasy to tell you the truth.  The crunch pork rinds were okay but not worth the calories.  They had two bbq sauce options, none of which were mind blowing or enhanced the flavor.  The best part of the entire meal was the waffled cornbread which was outstanding.  I should have just ordered a few of these.   My friends, on the other hand, received a giant portion of smoked chicken quarters (leg/thigh) with waffled mac n' cheese with a dipping sauce.  They liked the mac n' cheese which needed the sauce to make it cheesey enough.  However, the chicken was completely raw.   I know what you're going to say, it was smoked so a little pink happens.  I've enjoyed many a smoked products.  This was raw.  When you cut into the chicken, red blood pooled and spilled out.  Not to mention the texture (yes, we did try a bite) was horrid.  There was no way this was safe nor edible.  The kitchen was apologetic, and gave my friends their money back even though they ate the mac n' cheese.  The thing is, I saw a lot of people eating the chicken regardless and their's was raw too.  This is a serious healthy hazard and the moment the kitchen noticed raw chicken being returned should have go around and informed people.  This is a scary thing!   So yeah, not going to come here again to eat the food.  Salmonella just isn't something I want to mess with.  I would come back to have a drink if I was in the area.  So be warned and make sure what you're eating is cooked."	1star
So good, with the one downside of being way too cramped. We originally wanted to go to Malt House a few doors down but even stepping inside required screaming to be heard. I'm glad we ultimately wound up at Kuu Ramen, a hole-in-the-wall right across the street from a Fulton Street stop, because it was relatively quiet inside and the food was amazing.  After eating a week of sad lunch salads, the spicy salmon don with roe was amazing - chunks of fish and avocado, pickles, a smattering of arugula underneath (which was a tad random), and white rice. I hoovered the whole thing up within a matter of bites. The portion was pretty satisfying for $15, and also came with soup.  Two rice bowls and a small eggplant appetizer cost about $41, tip included. Not the cheapest lunch option, given how tiny the eggplant appetizer was, and it got massively crowded during the latter half of our meal. Because of the way the tables and chairs are set up, people waiting only have enough to stand around in the spaces of people eating ... which makes for slightly awkward eye contact when jamming a spoonful of rice and fish into your mouth.  The menu also has ramen and a small selection of sushi rolls.	4star
Was good but I got the indian bread appetizer and it was cold when it came out. Everything else was good, the hianan chicken is always a staple	4star
Was visiting Brooklyn this past Friday and ended up eating here with my friend because we couldn't get a table at Lilia. The guacamole was really good so I guess on that one the $12 price tag was maybe justified but with everything else? I was really disappointed. We had the bistec tacos which were ok, again $12 dollars for these two tiny tacos. Now if they were like out of this world delicious I wouldn't complain but they were ok at best. The other tacos we had, I totally forgot the name, were actually really good but again, two tiny tacos for $12? And then there were the $18 dollar enchiladas... I almost said something to our server because of what a rip off that was. It was a child size portion for that price but the worst part... the sauce literally tasted like chef boyarde sauce, like the sauce that's on those ravioli's in a can. It was TERRIBLE. The sad thing was that all could've been made up by the service, but that was not good either, we were rushed when there wasn't even anyone there. Our server was clearing out plates and trying to take my $5 coronita away before we even finished everything. Again, those prices to portion size would have been justified IF the food was worth it but it just wasn't.  I don't think I'd ever go back to eat there next time I'm in Brooklyn unless anyone could recommend me something that would really change my mind. 2 stars for the guacamole.	2star
This place is ok. Materials are not that fresh. I would give it 4 stars if I wrote this review 3 years ago. However, after visiting so many good Japanese restaurants, I can only give it 3 stars.	3star
Sea Witch is truly flaw free. As many people have mentioned before, the backyard is absolutely lovely. There's a pond, koi, turtles, a very vocal bullfrog, plenty of seating, etc. That said, sitting inside isn't bad either. The ambiance is pretty sexy - great nautical themed artwork, an aquarium with some colorful buddies inside and great seating options both for a group or a date. The food is definitely worth sampling, too. Love the shishito peppers for something different and the fries for something familiar done exceptionally well.  I can't speak highly enough of this space!	5star
"Great cheese selection.  Antipasto Misto is fantastic.  Love a good lambrusco, so was very excited to have ""wine served in a bowl"".  Fun experience. This place is ALWAYS busy... but super cozy.   Good date spot, fun meet-up for girlfriends, and good for groups, as well, since most plates can be shared."	4star
8/10 This place is hard to figure out - it looks like a dingy, dive bar where drinks are served in plastic cups and you probably shouldn't try the food, let alone use the restroom. Is this all an attempt at being hipster ironic? Or a ruse to keep out New York elites and maintain a local charm? Regardless of the intent, the food here is on point and the atmosphere is exciting and charming in its own way.  The seafood doesn't disappoint, and I enjoyed some of the Asian inspired fair (try the stuffed eggplant!). The fish and chips were perfect. The owners wander around and are focused on keeping the mood high - I had at least 2 shots of Jameson with the owner out of plastic shot glasses (hard not to love a place with free drinks!).  I'd definitely come back to try other seafood items. It's a bit rowdy and I probably would go on the earlier side with a group to make sure you have a table. It's the kind of place where friends can drink beers all night and the noise level can get a bit high. Come early for dinner or late for drinks.	4star
James, You took my comment left field about the staff. I know what the Law is, and I wasn't suggesting that you hire only African Americans. I'm just saying at the time I came I didn't see any. At the end of the day, that is your business not telling you how to run the show. I am just a customer who was saying her opinion on Yelp,  This is my experience with the food. My thoughts on the staff are my opinion, but still you didn't address the issue which has to do with the tasting of the food. I heard about this restaurant on I don't do clubs black-owned section.   I came for brunch.  I order the chicken and waffles; I was very disappointed the chicken had no taste what so ever! And the waffle was horrible no flavor. My boyfriend had biscuits with lobster bites.  It was like one tiny piece of lobster at best the biscuits were not filling what so ever.  We had a drink called the Big- A-Lin which is grape juice and champagne.  It was ok I didn't taste any champagne.  I was very disappointed with this restaurant,  But now reading other reviews a few people had the same experience with the chicken not being seasoned. I wish I would have checked Yelp before coming. But you live, and you learn. I will not be coming back.	1star
My entree was really good, I ordered the Roasted Chicken. I also ordered the Empanada for dessert. The only issue I had was that the apples inside the Empanada were cold when they were suppose to be warm - and I don't mean cold as in they started to cool down after the dish had been brought out. Half of the apples were actually ice cold.	3star
Food was great - all very homemade. Eclectic menu! Not fancy...just good food!	4star
I've been to Ippudo three times in the past and have had a great experience.  This time, I went and ordered the wasabi ramen.  Avoid this at all costs!  The broth had no flavor and tasted like hot water with a hint of wasabi.  I've had takeout ramen from Japanese grocery stores that was better than this.  In the soup floated pieces of toasted rice, two small shrunken pieces of tofu, and three pieces of what I think were bamboo shoots.  There was literally no flavor to the the soup and it was certainly not worth the price or the wait.  I'm disappointed that Ippudo deems this worth serving to their customers. When we gave the feedback to the waiter, he did not understand what was going on and did not do anything to address the situation.	2star
The tacos have pretty good flavor but there's a loooot of room for the seafood to be crispier. The fish might still be alive, seeing as how they're swimming in sour cream. Way too much sour cream. Almost four stars, but the lukewarm fried seafood just couldn't cut it.	3star
Make reservations it gets packed... I had the latin Benedict it was pretty good, not worth 25 but it is because you get unlimited sangria.. we also had yuca fries, they were basic, a lil dry not fresh... you are really paying for the drinks. It was my 1st time here.. we felt rushed to give our order to the waiter... came 3 times to take out order within minutes... I havent seen my friend in a while and we were talking, i felt like i needed to hurry up and order... the food is pre made it comes very fast within minutes to the table... in order to get sangria you need to be eating the whole time... when you stop eating no more sangria, eat slow i guess... the sangrias are very good and strong... other then that we may or may not go back... nothing special Ive been to many latin brunch spots this is at the end of my list... bronx has better brunch...	3star
Phenomenal! Fresh, vibrant, and authentic plates served in this cozy nook had my teenage son and me buzzing for days. Or maybe that was the Iced Thai coffee, which was the best coffee beverage we've ever had. The secret ingredient? Maple sugar.	5star
To be totally honest, I cannot say I was blown away with Ipanema.  The food was GOOD, don't get me wrong.  However, nothing really stood out to me to set Ipanema apart from any other Brazilian spot I've been to. It's almost like going from one Italian spot on Mulberry to the next (most of the time they're almost exactly the same). However, if you're in the mood for a good, solid Brazilian meal -- Ipanema definitely won't break the bank and will hit the spot just fine.	3star
"I was very excited to visit this place because I kept hearing that they serve ""the best steak in New York"". There must be something wrong with my taste buds because I don't share that same opinion. Steak for Two- We ordered medium, but received medium rare. The steak was tough and contained a significant amount of fat. It wasn't flavorful at all. The steak sauce tasted mostly like cocktail sauce, but it was tasty. ($104) Creamed Spinach- It was rather plain, but still enjoyable. ($11) French Fried Potatoes- These fries were the thickest, blandest fries I've ever had. ($7) ""Holy Cow"" Hot Fudge Sundae- The star of my visit. Fluffy homemade whipped cream, creamy vanilla ice cream, and a generous amount of fudge. It wasn't too sweet at all, it was delicious. ($13) I'm glad that I finally experienced this place for myself."	3star
So something that I've found every time that I make a trip down to New York is that after I leave a restaurant with a significantly lighter wallet I always justify my purchase by saying the food was worth it. But the honest truth is that a lot of times it's not. You have to seek out the gems where the food is actually worth the hype because a lot of times it's the environment or experience that jazz everything up which covers up the fact that the food is really just mediocre. Ippudo fits into this category. When you walk in, all the waiters greet you in Japanese which admittedly is cool and the chic, non traditional dining area adds to the overall experience. I ordered the classic ramen with the seasoned boiled egg - and it was really salty. Salty to the point that I drank almost three glasses of water while I was there. I wasn't loving the pork or the mushrooms in the ramen either. I'm Korean so I love almost all Asian cuisine and I was left really disappointed. Was pretty expensive for the amount/quality of food but I don't expect anything less since it's New York.	3star
Good when the bartenders try and provide timely service. I used to love coming in for the lunch specials. The last three times there I've walked out after 15 minutes of sitting at the bar and not being helped. I understand if it's a big crowd and there's a big game on, which is not the case when I pop in.  Not all the bartenders are bad. Just some of them truly seem preoccupied with something else and not very eager to ya know, work. Truly sucks because it can be an awesome pub for lunch and catching games. It will be a while until I try and see if I waste my time here again. Waitress staff is awesome and not to be included with this review.	1star
Located among luxurious old brownstones on the Upper East Side lies the very fancy Uva. This is THE spot to be if you're looking for one of the best and most sought after Italian restaurants in the city.  I would first strongly reccommend calling ahead and making reservations before coming here. They are always extremely busy, and even if you did make a reservation, because the food and vibe here is so lively you still might have to wait a little bit longer before they can get a table cleaned and ready for you. You literally can't go wrong with the menu here at Uva. I kept staring in awe at the tables next to me at all the different and wonderful pasta dishes being served. I almost wish I had an unlimited room in my digestive system so I could try all those different pastas!  I did eventually decide on the Cavatelli Fior Di Pesto. The cavatelli was soo perfect.......not too hard, but just soft enough, almost like a good gnocchi which they also serve here. It was bathe in a very rich pesto sauce, I could taste both the emulsion of the Parmigiana cheese with the basil. I also had the Burrata as an appetizer. It was soo creamy, and the texture literally melted in my mouth. For dessert I stayed simple and had 3 scoops of gelato, two vanilla scoops and one hazelnut. And as always I ended with a warm cup of Cappuccino. The entire night was just divine, and the service I received was friendly and welcoming.	5star
Used to love it. Then they suddenly decided they would not honor request to leave out an ingredient. So if you have allergies, not your best bet.	2star
Seriously overrated! 4 stars for this place? I hail from cow state and we have better Latin American food than this establishment.  People in Brooklyn must have different expectations. I guess the concept of garden dining automatically makes an establishment trendy.  For starters the place was way too hot and dark. I guess it's supposed to be romantic but I just can't imagine staring into the eyes of my beloved with sweat dripping down the side of my face. Definitely not a fan. I'm not used to restaurants that don't have AC. I'm from an area where dining areas are equipped with AC or mist systems.  Services was okay. I was with a group and there was a baby there with us. Service wasn't that at tentative.  The menu was a lengthy menu. To be honest way too long!!  I don't think anything really jumped out at me.  I ordered the organic chicken because I don't normally buy chicken myself. My meal was decent but not amazing. Others got steak and fish. I dabbled at their meals and won't be running back anytime soon to have dinner here.	3star
We took arancini, lasagna and orechiette with brocolis and garlic. Before the dishes, they served us few slices of bread and butter, the bread was crunchy on the outside and gooey In the inside ! Arancini was very delightfull ! The tomato sauve was a little bit salty for me but it tasted very good,  Lasagna tasted good too !  Orechiette was nt fresh but i knew it before i ordered :) pasta orechiette was cooked al dente, so it was Nice. I love garlic so i was satisfied but i miss something  punchy In that dish.. And the tiramisu, very good  A little bit expensive but good	4star
Phenomenal food. Grilled Octupus was amazing. Grilled clams perfect and plump. Best stuffed grape leaves that melted in your mouth!	5star
Arrived moments before our reservation, and would have preferred to sit at the bar for a cocktail, but we were seated immediately. Had the champagne cocktail and invecchiato, which were perfect and refreshing.  We made the mistake of ordering right away, should have paced it out - though it was not pressed upon us, the polenta appetizer was out within moments and we were barely through our drinks. The waiter sensed this and subtly paced out the entrees, which was appreciated.  We went with pasta of course - black farfalle, and short rib agnolotti. They were perfect and amazed those seated on either side of us, who seemed to be waiting on what we got ;), and so they ordered the same (for the most part). The agnolotti was amazing - I enjoy when the meat/sauce is tucked into folds of pasta. The farfalle was a bit salty, but bold seafood flavors were predominant.  We asked for recommendations on wine pairings based on our tastes - a pinot noir and a balanced red (sorry cannot recall it!) were on spot.  For her birthday they put a candle and 'Happy Birthday' on her Espresso Budino,which tasted amazing. The chocolate cake was just as decadent.  The second half of dinner was a much more comfortable pace, and we appreciated it - will a full room or with a couple empty tables, we were not herded in and out.   Sometimes got a bit boisterous, but not consistently so. All in all a wonderful time.	4star
The ambiance and interior is beautiful. It feels like you're dining on a yacht. But my opinion is this place is exorbitantly expensive for no reason. Average entree ranges from mid-$20 to $50. Appetizers go up to mid-$20's. Soup and salads are $16. Specialty rolls range from $16-$22. This is probably a place better for restaurant week, since this is one of those places where you'll spend a lot but still be hungry afterwards. Instead of bread you get a basket of salt and vinegar chips. Those were delicious, but for a table of 5 people, we got a really tiny basket of chips. We should have at least gotten two tiny baskets. I got the King Crab California specialty roll (Alaskan king crab, cucumber, avocado, tobiko, topped with shredded Alaskan king crab). It was delicious, but extremely small. The roll was $16 for 8 tiny pieces, so I'm basically paying $2 a piece. If you compare to Luke's Lobster, you get like 3 times as much lobster meat for roughly the same price. Don't eat the roll with soy sauce. It'll ruin the crab flavor.  Another person in my group did get the actual lobster roll which came with chips and slaw for $30. At Luke's lobster you can get pretty much the same thing, maybe more lobster meat too, for $20. Albeit the presentation isn't as nice. You're probably paying more for the ambiance and the possibility of a celebrity sighting than for the actual tastiness of the food itself. The desserts did look delicious though. Another person in my group got the Cookies N' Cream which looked great. I think I would come back just for dessert only.	3star
'Twas a pretty below average pizza place in my opinion. Upon walking in, we were told they were only selling pizza at the moment, which we were totally fine with. As we were being seated I asked the woman escorting us why they only had pizza at the moment (being a first timer not only in this restaurant but in NY obv I wasn't aware of their pizza sched) & she responded in a very rude, defensive tone which I found a bit weird b/c it sounded like it was something I was already supposed to know.  From the start I felt a weird vibe from the workers but brushed it off b/c the pizza was supposed to be really good. We ordered the Rubirosa Supreme small size and as I picked it off the metal plate, half of the cheese & toppings completely slid off. I spent the rest of the time trying to bite my pizza before the toppings could fall off. Overall, the pizza was below average due to the fact that it's way too thin where it was soggy from the sauces & too thin where not even the toppings were able to stay in place. Kind of a messy experience!	3star
"Here I go again ranting about restaurants who don't believe in their servers writing shit down.  Time to set the scene. It's Wednesday around 6:30pm on the last day of summer. We're a group of 5 and the restaurant is about half full or half empty depending on how well your Zoloft is working today.  When we arrived, we noticed that there was 1 server and 1 bartender who both seemed in good spirits. We were seated in the backyard and asked about drinks right away. Now watch out. This review is about to take a drastic turn.  After we ordered drinks, we waited. Then we waited some more and after a little more waiting, our drinks came. When the waitress came back, we were way past ready to order. We ordered appetizers and main meals at the same time and yup...this woman did not write one thing down. 3 appetizers and 5 meals with a ton of substitutions and questions in the middle...not one word written. And then we waited again and waited some more.  The main meal surprisingly came about 15 min after the appetizers and thankfully the food was good and hot. 3 out of 5 of us had been here before so we knew the food was worth it.  After 4 of us we're served, we waited for the last person in our party to get their meal. After about 5 minutes, she insisted that we start without her. 20 minutes later, after everyone was on their last few bites and the waitress was nowhere to be found, we were still waiting on the last entree. At this point we were all pissed and one of us got up to find the waitress. She was happily standing around by the opening of the kitchen EATING A PLATE OF FOOD. Ummmm seriously? So we angrily told her that we still hadn't  received all of our food. After an unapologetic & annoyed ""sorry"" SHE GOT MAD AT US!!! She asked what was missing (you would have known if you had written it down) and repeated about 10 times...""What!! I SAID I was sorrrry."" Ugh.  So after all of the meals were sent and eaten, I told the waitress that we were celebrating a birthday and to please bring us  a dessert. Though the dessert was on the house, nothing else was. Maybe if that last meal was on the house I wouldn't have complained as much, but the waitress seriously screwed up.  I will be coming here again for the food, but I will be very cautious if I see that woman again."	2star
"We had a dinner at this place about 3 months ago. Great food,  great service,  that's why we decided on going back. Unfortunately. We got there about 9.40 pm, an hour before restaurant was closing. The server took our drink order,  then we got him back for an appetizer order, which was Mozzarella Caprese, we had it last time and it was great. I have absolutely no concerns about the food, it was great. The service was ok, not to fast, but not too slow either. But the surprise was awaiting for us later, once we got our check. We had 18 percent gratuity included in our check, even though there were 3 of us having a dinner. I've asked the server, who dropped the check, about it,  and he told us that he's not our server, and he has no idea. I asked to speak to someone, who could of explain it to us, he told us he's going to bring the manager over. And that was another ""surprise"" for us. Once he stepped to our table, without any greeting, he said ""why did you call me for?"" I only have asked him why the gratuity was already included, and you can't beat the answer! ""All people who leave no tip for the service ask me that question.  Whatever,  you don't have to pay it"" With raising his voice on me, and hating attitude. Well, what would you expect,  if the person, who is there to deal with customers and supervise his staff, tells you if you don't like the way I talk to you, do not come back then. The worst experience I've ever had so far in NYC. Never ever again. Just will follow up with the manager Marco advice!"	1star
The staff, especially security, is unprofessional. They sexually harass female customers. The food is inconsistent. In addition, there have been several fights in and outside of the restaurant.	1star
I honestly don't know if this place is a club or restaurant. Really bad atmosphere. Not a place to eat, and I didn't even eat their food yet.	1star
The presentation was good...the food suck....I had better ramen and not for nothing over priced and over rated. Won't be going there again. Service sucks...the place is dingy looking.	1star
Was visiting in Brooklyn around lunchtime so I decided to try this place out. I really enjoyed the pizza and I would have given this place 5 stars but the place itself was a little rundown. But overall a very good experience. Would highly recommend!!	4star
I dined at Grazie last month and was surprised to have less than adequate service. I have been here several times and have good experiences & really love the food. Issue was: my dad and I called ahead and placed a food order ahead of time, to get our dinner quickly so we could make a movie on time. When the pizza arrived, the toppings were incorrect. I don't know who helped us (I think it was a manager) offered to take it back and bring the correct order; however, this would have defeated the entire purpose of ordering ahead and would have made us late. We had to settle for what was brought, which was not what I ordered and not what I wanted. This was gently made clear. What surprised me is that NO compensation whatsoever was offered. The man helping us even argued with me saying what was served to us was on the menu, saying we made the mistake. Really? I think I know what I ordered--I double checked the menu and it is one of the listed pizza options (which I have also ordered in the past). And when the tab came, the correct order was even typed on it!! Confirming this was the restaurant's mistake. Because I enjoy this place and have been a repeat customer, I expected this to be handled better, and am now put off by this place. Mistakes happen, and I am understanding of that, but you need to take responsibility for them and make it right with the customer, not blame them and make them (literally) pay for your error.	1star
Be careful! I was a very loyal client of Lobster Place. I was used to buying fish from them at least three times a week, but today I had a really bad experience. I have bought two lemon sole that I was used to paying no more than $26/28, and they presented me a check of $42... almost the double. When I said that there was a mistake, the simply told me that they have simply decided to increase the cost of fishes...	1star
Decent bistro grub if you don't mind eating inside a jet engine. I spent the night screaming into my friend's ear. Afterwards I was hoarse.	2star
I really wanted to like this place. But certain things aren't meant to be.  Came in on Wednesday night. Decent crowd not too busy. Great music mix of r&b, pop and indie. We were seated immediately. Our table was too small so we opted to sit at the bar area facing the kitchen. Big MISTAKE!  Server came over immediately to tell us about the special ball of the night (Mac & cheese balls with cheese sauce). He then said he would be back to take our orders. He took longer than expected to come back and take our orders. He asked us if we wanted something to drink we told him to come back while we looked at the menu. Meanwhile he didn't give us any water.  We ordered the buffalo chicken balls, I got the beef balls with the spicy meat sauce  my friend got the special balls with spaghetti. We received the buffalo chicken balls super fast. I mean so fast I questioned were they correct. The flavor was decent. Would've better if the would've coated them and if they were hot. The temperature was warm at best. I mean literally the balls were room temperature. That's why we got them so fast they forgot to heat them up.  Soon after the entrees came out. The server still hadn't returned to get our drink orders so we finally asked the runner who brought the food for water.  The beef balls in the spicy sauce were okay. For a place to be named the meatball shop I expected better. I felt like I could've made the same meatballs in my kitchen. The mac & cheese balls were good and unique. I couldn't see myself eating more than 1. But they did taste like Mac & cheese and contained pasta which was very clever. The spaghetti was plain and only covering was the cheese sauce that was with the balls. Blah. Half way into our entrees the server came and asked for our drink orders we just got 2 Jell-O shots I was very annoyed. Jell-O shots were good. Should do other flavors.  If the mediocre food wasn't bad enough the service and staff made it worse. Work should be fun. But when you have guest sitting at the kitchen area and can see and hear everything that's going on, staff should know how to conduct themselves. First the conversations the kitchen staff were having were ridiculous full of profane, derogatory, obscene, explicit language. I won't write what I heard but it shouldn't be repeated or ever be said in a professional environment. Second were the health code violations I witnessed.  1 girl had her long gray weave hanging down her back in a ponytail. The scarf she wore did nothing for all the hair hanging out with no hair net.  Next was a guy with his hair hanging out of his baseball cap with no hair net on.  Neither should've be been in the kitchen let alone preparing food. Then at one point a guy was sitting on the pick up area for food. At another point a guy was swatting some type of bug with his apron. They were stopping in the middle of making dishes to talk. Not changing gloves frequently enough. The list goes on. The were all just loud rambunctious talking across the restaurant. Totally unacceptable, unprofessional behavior. The server was just slow, clueless and barely checked in. There's a fine line between relaxed, cool hipster vibe and lazy, lack of care unprofessional atmosphere and this place was definitely the latter. I don't ever see myself returning.	1star
The vegetable and pork dumplings were tasty. Everything else was awful. Twice the wait staff came to the table and took food from us without explanation. I think it was because they gave me the wrong dumplings and to fill up the siracha bottle, but an explanation would have been nice. And they shouldn't have just taken the stuff straight off the table while we ate. The service was too slow. I had to wait even longer because the food came out too hot to be edible. On the day I came, the restaurant was way too hot. I could scarcely understand the words the women spoke when they called out order numbers. The shrimp dumplings were too wet and fishy. The number at the bottom of the check was so tiny I had to search for it.	1star
Ambiance was nice and service was pretty good but honestly for the price point in NYC you can do way better. Boxed pasta with acceptable sauce. Parmesan was not freshly grated. Bread in complementary bread basket was cold. The protein selection is great... Rabbit, sweet breads, lamb, suckling pig.... But again boxed pasta. So disappointing.	2star
"The food was good but I was dissatisfied with my waitress. After waiting for about 45 minutes, we were finally seated at the horseshoe bar. We asked our waitress for her opinion on the yakisoba, and she responded with a tone of disgust, ""it's just yakisoba."" I was already turned off by her attitude. We asked for more time before making our order, and she did not come back. The couple sitting next to us had arrived after us and had already received their order and our waitress had not even taken our order. We had been constantly signaling and she kept saying, ""one moment."" I was quite frustrated. She finally took our order and we soon got our food, which was great. But the service was so awful, we left barely any tip. When we starting heading out, another waitress chased after us and asked us why were unsatisfied and she apologized for our waitress.  Beyond the poor service, Ippudo's ramen is top notch. This place knows how to make its broth. I would also recommend their pork buns for an appetizer; the sauce on the buns are incredible. --  taste / 4 aesthetics / 4 vibe / 4 service / 0 price for quality / 3 OVERALL / 3.5"	3star
Great place for south Asian food! Spacious inside but still full at weekend dinner time, might need to wait for a while. Their Indian pancake and coconut rice are classic! Everything else we ordered are great too! Will definitely come back when I think about Malaysian food~	4star
A typical Chinese eatery, that has become famous for its soup dumplings. There's lines of people out the door, and it's a cash only establishment. While the soup dumplings are pretty good, the main thing is that they're cheap! $7 gets you 8 soupy dumps. Now I'm no mathematician, but i make that 0.87c a dumpling, which isn't half bad.  The rest of the food is relatively standard for what you'd expect for a chinese restaurant - it includes all the staples such as general Tso's, black bean etc.  The place doesn't take reservations, so if you come with a group, chances are you're in for a wait! As I say, the dumplings are good, but it's only 3 stars for me because I don't think the dumplings are so good that it's worth the wait. I'd much recommend going to Jing Fong (which again, has decent soup dumplings for the price, but probably no wait).	3star
I didn't like my visit here, the place was cute and had pretty good reviews. However I left with my friend because we weren't attended to and waited atleast 10	1star
Average BBQ but they're always out of tidbits which is weird  If you can get a table right away it's cool but food and service not worth the wait if there's a line	3star
Like the other reviews, I must caution this is CASH ONLY. Not a criticism just know before you go.  We happened upon Almar at an odd time - 3ish on a Sunday. They were still serving brunch and were able to get a seat right away.  The menu is simple but interesting. Pete got a porketta panini with broccoli rabe and I got a kale salad. We each asked for mozzarella to be substituted for the cheese our dish came with. This request was accommodated by the waitress and kitchen without issue. The food was tasty with clean, fresh flavors. The panini's bread was soft and chewy in the best way. The broccoli rabe was so perfect and complimented the pork. The kale was crunchy and cut into thin strips to make it palatable.  Lots to like here.	4star
It was my first time here with friends, celebrating birthday.. had horrible time, will never be back again.. on the website they say they are open till 2am , we get there around 11:00 server took order from us and before food was delivered security guy came (how can he call himself security guy have no idea) and told us we have 3 more minutes before closing. Food was not even delivered on the table. We had full glasses of drinks so we didn't pay attention on this guy because I couldn't even imagine he could kick everyone out this way.. finally we got our burgers and I was about to start eating he came back again and told us to leave.. I asked what about food and drinks???? His offer was he could give us togo boxes and plastic cups and we could finish food and drink downstairs in the lobby ... this is unbelievable !!! I've never heard something like that I'm my life.  Why they took order if the place was closing and even if it is closing and I'm still having food how they can kick us out?? Disaster experience !! Wouldn't even put one star	1star
Came here for lunch twice. Both times the food and service was amazing! Got the deviled eggs and chicken and waffles and will be back again :)	5star
Came here for dinner after exploring a bit in DUMBO. Question of the century: Grimaldi's or Juliana's? When we arrived at 6, there was a small line for Juliana's and none for Grimaldi's. I naturally gravitate toward crowds and popular things and after hearing that Juliana's pizzas are better...Juliana's it is! We waited in line for about 5 mins before we were seated. It's a pretty small restaurant but the tables are a good distance away from each other so that you won't be banging elbows with your neighbors or having to worry about strangers eavesdropping on your conversations. Restroom is located down a flight of stairs in the kitchen and it was clean. We got our pizza about 15 mins after we ordered. Service was very good!! Everyone was very nice and my glass was always refilled on a frequent basis. We got the Margherita pizza with pepperoni and I found it to be pretty good. The crust was excellent. Toppings weren't bad either. I can't say it's the best pizza I've ever had but for the amount we paid, I think it was worth it. What I didn't like was that even when it arrived at our table, the pizza was only lukewarm. The first few slices tasted good but by the time we got to the last few slices, they sort of got too cold and didn't taste as good. $21 for a large Margherita (+$3 for pepperoni) and we were both full after sharing it. It's a popular and hyped up place but I would say the pizza is only slightly above average. But honestly can you bear to visit DUMBO without trying at least one of its two popular pizza places? Definitely worth a pit stop, especially if you rarely go to this area.	4star
I like Lure for their happy hour. The drinks are $10 and they are delicious. The tough part is getting a seat at the bar. The place is always packed in the bar area, even after the happy hour is over. This time I came for a light dinner and was seated immediately at one of the tables near the bar area. Ordered the Toro roll which was very tasty as expected. Hard to go wrong with Toro. The price is a bit shocking. I don't think I've ever paid $19 for a single cut roll. Good but not sure if it was worth it. Also ordered the Lure burger and split this w my partner. It was really nice to see them split the burger and plate on 2 plates without having to ask. Unfortunately the burger was not very memorable. There wasn't much flavor in the meat. It was a bit disappointing. Next time I'll stick to the cocktails and seafood.	3star
Disorganized no regard for the customer. I wouldn't know anything about the food because I never got my order, they messed up I waited for over 45 minutes and they did very little to fix this problem. The manager said they could have it out in less then 5 seconds; if my food was able to come out in 5 seconds why did I have to wait over 45 mins? The only solution she had to offer was either my money back or get my food out in 5 seconds no apologies no offer for a side or something because it was totally THEIR FAULT. Will not be coming back again and also Pro Tip Mables: there are a lot of BBQ places offering the same thing you are you should value your customers.	1star
The pizza is good, in my opinion not worth the 1 hour wait in line.  I say walk the bridge, go get pizza, do it at least once in life and you can say you got the experience.  The staff wasn't the nicest, we were very rushed and felt like we couldn't really enjoy our food.  Good pizza but eh wouldn't come here again.	4star
Red Rooster was a stop on a birthday crawl and it wasn't bad/ it wasn't great. After a certain point the back half of the restaurant is closed and everyone is relegated to the front bar area only, which makes sense but it is a tiny space. It was uncomfortably packed, nowhere to move or sit, couldn't really enjoy the music. - Beautiful layout, tight space. There is a lounge/club downstairs with a $ cover, the line to get down was far too ridiculous to bother.	3star
Words can simply not do justice to how awesome Root&Bone is. If you're a fan of southern food, you'll absolutely love it. And if you're not, they will convert you. They're that good. We came here for a restaurant week(end) brunch. It was quite packed so we got a counter seat by the window which was not ideal but very soon we did not care. The food was excellent from the start to the end. They really went above and beyond their restaurant week obligations, and the abundance of food was only exceeded by its quality. What we had: Biscuits (for the table) - Buttery, flaky and delicious, and topped with coarse salt that gave it a pop of flavor. They came with some gravy for dipping that paired really well with them. Deviled eggs: Really good, pink from beetroot juice and quite flavorful. Fried chicken and Waffle sandwiches; More of an open faced sandwich, with a slice of fried green tomato to add an interesting texture and flavor. The chicken was delicious, crispy and moist. Biscuits and Gravy: Delicious! Really well seasoned and tasty with none of that annoying lard/flour flavor you sometimes get with this dish. They used a lot of their signature biscuits in it, that made it super tasty. Also comes topped off with eggs. Mac and Cheese (for the table): If anything fell a bit short in the meal, this was it. While quite good and nicely crusted with breadcrumbs, I felt that this was not as great as the other dishes. Watermelon (for the table): A simple dish of watermelon slices with mint, onion and a lime vinaigrette. A nice light counterbalance to all the super rich food. Banana pudding -  Light, creamy and fluffy with a nice biscuit base. Not too strong of a banana flavor. Lime tart - A little too limey (and tart!) for my liking but quite decent otherwise. The place is quite small and the food is amazing so naturally it's a bit hard to get reservations here. But don't let that put you off! Make it a point to go here and you will not be disappointed!	5star
The bo ssam meal is great for groups of 6-10. Get a magnum bottle of wine and you are set! The bo ssam is $250 which is very reasonable for the amount of food. Most of the staff was attentive and friendly.	4star
Looking for some good food and being in the area, I remembered having book-marked the place a while ago and all agreed to try.  We were happy not to have to wait online (apparently everybody felt like Korean that night and most places had long wait time) and were seated quickly.  Loved the decor, very retro feel to it.  The food - I'm very sad to say did not meet our expectations.  The ribs appetizer were ok - not too bad but some were chewier than others.  Bulgogi did have a nice flavor to it but the seafood stew just didn't do it for me - aside from being spicy, had no real flavor to it at all.  Really not a favorite ...	3star
"Great spot near union square! Found on Yelp and thought we'd stop by for lunch. Lunch special was a great value! Delicious pad see ew and dumpling. Absolutely LOVED the BBQ pork bao. I think it's new management but this place was getting BUSY with takeout orders while we were there. Not a big space so all the yelling at each other (fighting?) in the ""back"" of house was definitely heard where we were sitting. My friends water glass also had a lipstick mark on it but she ordered the Thai iced tea so she ended up just letting it go.  Overall great food and pretty friendly service at very good prices. Just need to polish up some basics and it'll be a PERFECT 5 star!"	4star
The food was not seasoned well. I would have expected more soul taste. This was my 1st and last trip. I had the mac n cheese and fried chicken	2star
It's a great outdoor and indoor place to chill , and chat with friends .  Every Sunday they have movie night at 8pm which is pretty dope . The only thing is they don't take cards it's cash only !	4star
Awful restaurant. Their place is very nice and I was very happy to be there. The food, the fish omelet, was salty, But I enjoyed it. Their lemonade was not refillable and they didn't tell me that, I had to pay twice for it. That was something I wasn't happy about. Anyway the food was done and I got my recipe. After she brought back I gave her 15$ tip, the amount I thought was enough for her. I went to the bathroom and when I came back she was asking my sister why we gave her this much tip. I couldn't believe what I saw, her name was Mariam. I never saw a waitress being so rude. Tip is not a must, it's a favor. She made me change my tip from 15$ to 18$. For 3$ she was so low to come to the bathroom door and make us change my tip. I would NEVER go there again. So sad that a great place like this has a rude waitress like her.	1star
They just opened and the food is amazing! Real family feel inside and the guys who own are sweethearts. Check this place out for good food and cute ambiance!	5star
OK so maybe I've been to too many GREAT Cuban restaurants that makes me not care for this one and makes it my first and last time here... First of all , I do have to say that the restaurant itself has an elegant appeal to it which I liked the customer service is PHENOMENAL and that's the reason why I'm giving it a 2 instead of a 1 our waiter went above and beyond to explain the menu gave us a few suggestion was very attentive and service was rather fast . Now the food , As an appetizer, we ordered the BBQ chicken empanadas (2) empanadas split in two gorgeous presentation but why I care for presentation if the food is not great... The chicken tasted old but it was still juicy but it was sweet I guess the BBQ made it sweet I literally had only half didn't like it.. As an entree I got the ropa vieja which comes with the shredded beef rice and beans (no sweet plantains,) like every Cuban restaurant... Amyway, there was more stew sauce then meat in it ... For $20 a plate I expect at least half a lb of meat so I could have leftovers for the next 3 meals... Either way I guess it was a good thing ,it wasn't a lot because I would felt bad throwing away all that tasteless food...  The ropa vieja needed more adobo garlic and sofrito had no flavor once or ever. My husband ordered the vacca frita again no flavor not even Jesus could help that food with some flavor..  Now desert was  delicious but for $10 they could of gave me a bigger slice ..  I literally ate it in 3 bites and I'm not a big girl.... Needless to say, in my opinion, this place is still open because of its magnificent service and not so much for the food all those great reviews were done by people without taste buds ... $135 later for dinner for 2 people I was angry at my husband for wanting to try something different because at Cuban Pete's in Montclair we usually get 2 appetizers a jar of mojito 2 entrees ,and 2 desserts and the bill never comes up to even $80.... I don't care if I have to pay $135 for a meal for 2 if the food is exquisite but this place didn't WOW me. Never again.	2star
This is not your usual Thai food. I'm definitely more comfortable with mid/southern Thai food when it comes to spices and texture. The waitress described for us that the Thai food here is influenced by northern chiangmai and burmese cuisine. My group came at 5:30 just in the time for the line to get in and we were seated within 15 minutes. After we ordered, we waited about 45 minutes before our first dish came out. The boar collar was dry and the only spice I tasted was spicy. The rest of the dishes we ordered included the vermicelli (shrimp and pork belly), wings, duck salad, pork belly. Mostly were just staples of the restaurant. Nothing too memorable and probably would've come back here again.	2star
This is the kind of place that you happen to stumble upon in the corner of a quiet residential block, and just takes you by surprise. Yes it can get a little crowded at times, yes it's not a big space, but none of that matters when you start speaking to the people who work there. You can tell they really care about their customers and put in a lot of care and effort into preparing the meals and drinks. It's a bit on the pricey end (minus 1 star) because Queens is all about cheap and Amazing ethnic food and this place felt like being in Williamsburg where somehow high cost is justified on almost everything, just because. Overall, this is a must visit for everyone - friends, couples and even families (just don't bring a stroller). About the food, try everything over a course of time. But these are my must haves. - Skirt Steaks - Burger - Hot dog - Tacos	4star
Met one of the owners ... His name is Fernando.  I started a conversation with him because he speaks Spanish like I do, he's Argentinian.  I was sitting there having a casual conversation with a child hood friend of his, a man in his 50's when two Jet fans came in.  They stopped and talked to us about how hot it was at the game.  I asked if there were any demonstrations at the game since just yesterday Trump publicly berated anyone who demonstrated against the national anthem.  That's when things got strange.  I happened to be wearing a Kapernick jersey although I'm a Jets fan.  I wear it in solidarity with the protests that have been going on in the League.  After I asked about the demonstrations, not soon after I was attacked on that subject on all sides by the Owner, his friend and the couple who just returned from the Jets game.  They all continued to ramble on about the how disrespectful it was to demonstrate against the flag, etc. Even after I explained to them the very valid reasons that these demonstrations are happening.  Eventually, I had to cut the conversation short when I realized there was no reasoning with these people.  I will never come back here again and I suggest all rational people do the same. #TakeTheKnee	1star
Service is good and food is good. Drinks are happy hour $5. Great.  But the food at the end of it getting the combo I have a salty after taste in my mouth. Everything good just a bit salty. Only give a three star because it a bit salty. But everything else is great. Good place for group or date. Got the kobe combo it's great but have to say again for my taste bud it's salty	3star
DO NOT PAY BEFORE PICK UP! They will make you wait forever since they already got the money! BAD ATTITUDE  as well!	1star
No menus and no Checks They come to your table and just tell you the amount of your bill without itemized amounts! Very strange	3star
Excellent Vietnamese fusion banh mi. The restaurant is relatively medium size and has a trendy vibe aimed at teenagers or young adults.  The bulgogi is insanely delicious and correctly proportioned with meat, pickled daikon, carrots, cucumber, cilantro, sauce, and thickness of bread. How awful is it when the bread is too thick for the sandwich? At JoJu, it's just right. The fries are OK, the toppings are the same as a banh mi, so it was a bit repetitive.  Surprisingly the crispy chicken wings are fantastic! They are battered and fried, you may choose a sauce to add, get the soy garlic (ermergawd)!  The CHILLERS ARE SO GOOD! Half slush half green tea, then lychee jelly. Perfect for hot days. Forewarning: it taste artificial and sweet at first if your pallet is not accustomed to eating this sort of thing.  Last tip: add a runny egg on everything!	5star
"Genuine fresh Jambalaya or Zatarains Brown Rice Jambalaya? Had dinner with the gf here. I had the blackened catfish po boy. Delicious but uou have to get through the thick bread to get to the taste of the catfish.  The gf had the jambalaya that was supposed to have ""Chicken and Andouille Sausage"" but was just a bowl of tasty rice. We've eaten here before and skimping on the meat or seafood seems to be the norm. Last time we had a shrimp dish that just had three shrimp??? If the dish can be loaded up with rice and stew, good luck finding anything else in there. We only ate the Jambalaya  because the whole meal was spent.looking for (""there's got to be some in here somewhere???"") the non-existent Chicken and Andouille Sausage. Funny story: we mentioned the lack of Chicken and Andouille Sausage to our terrific waiter Anthony (who apologized profusely), who told the manager who took a WHOLE 10%  ($3.00 or so) off the bill. WOW! So $12.00 for a bowl of Zatarains Brown Rice Jambalaya! Customer appreciation rules here! That's how to keep customers coming back!"	2star
This place was amazing. We had reservations so we got seated right away. The place is very busy for brunch as everyone wants to dine here. The food was absolutely amazing and flavorful and very filling as well. The drinks were strong and having unlimited drinks was a great thing. This place is a great boozy brunch and I would highly recommend it for sure	5star
Great staff. The food is priced on the heavier side but it was flavorful. Very open floor plan and nice ambience.	3star
++ - Bulgogi Bun (tongue with drool emoji) - Korean fried chicken bun (thumbs up, high five, and lady dancing emoji)  + - Got the bowl equivalents; buns are better than bowls, just less filling (bowl  + sunglasses face emoji) -  - No sticky fries (sad face with tear emoji)	3star
Ahhhh! Super nice servers and amazing food.  Visiting from SF and happy we came here - Food: mussels, steak tartare and sack of bread were all super delicious.  Drinks: sauvignon blanc + Russian hill paired well with our dishes!	5star
I really wanted to give this place more stars because the staff is so nice and attentive, they have a nice selection of beer and it's a cute place near my apt BUT I find that their food is a little too expensive for what it is. I'm underwhelmed by the food and prices but if they could just work on those things this would be such a cool spot. The thing that bugged me the most were the chicken wings. You get 6 frozen Tyson tasting chicken wings for like $12 or $13 which es un robo. The margaritas were also no good. I had trouble finishing mine which never happens. Hope they can fix these things because I'd like to see them stick around the neighborhood.	3star
Soup Dumplings always get me in the door. Love it but I'm never a fan of the soy sauce black vinegar dipping sauce.  If it's busy here then I'll go to Shanghai Cafe (which is mediocre). This is one of the best Shanghai places to go ion Chinatown. It's actually one of my favorite place. Sometimes there is a wait for tables but it's quick service and good food. I usually get the soup dumplings and pan fried (crispy) noodles.	4star
The joy of being on vacation is you get to come to places like Ippudo on a random Thurs afternoon around 2:15 pm without a wait!! We were quickly seated and I loved that they announce your entrance - definitely adds to the authenticity vibe and how everyone (even the non Asians) working there spoke at least a few words of Japanese. I ordered the spicy tonkotsu with chashu and a side of soft boiled egg. The broth was delicious and one of the best I've had in the US. The chashu was a bit disappointing and not very well flavored. I also ordered a raspberry flavored sparkling sake with fruit jelly that they served in a can and poured into a champagne flute. Great experience, good food, fun staff, can't wait to come back (though I don't think I could justify the 1-2h typical wait).	4star
Sat in the back garden with 2 friends for dinner. Lovely outdoor area, but the compliments end there. Service was a mess - disorganized and chaotic. Putting in our order, re-ordering drinks and settling the tab was painful. They were out of the pulled pork sandwich, so had the burger. Small and flavorless. Had braised greens on the side that were so soggy, they were inedible. The corn fritters - I'm not joking - two TINY (about the size of a dumpling) greasy fritters for $5. We couldn't help but laugh.  We walked away hungry and dissatisfied. The staff didn't ask about our food or apologize for the service. I really wanted to like this place bc the staff and owner seemed cool, but never ever again. In response to the owner leaving the sarcastic comment below: Poking fun is no way to handle unhappy customers. All my reviews are fair, and touch on all aspects of the dining experience. Half my reviews are 4-5 stars, so no argument there. Considering the competition and high turnover in this city you should take diners more seriously. You took our money and we walked away with a poor experience, so I guess the joke's on us. Good luck.	2star
This place is incredible. Great neighborhood joint, nice casual vibe.  Reasonable prices (cash only). The Spinach fettuccini bolognese, bruschetta with burrata and honey, kale salad, and tiramisu are my favorites. They are so good that I rarely deviate from them. That being said, the other stuff I have tried is always amazing too.	5star
The best pizza I have ever had was right here in this joint! Every bite literally just melts in your Mouth. This is not your regular round pizza, it's pan pizza. Cooked in a half sheet pan giving it a slight crunch at the bottom and moist doughy inside. I got just plain cheese pizza. My favorite. The pan serves 10 pieces. The restaurant had a lot of seats for 2 and/or for groups. Also has a bar and a small television with college football on. This pizza beat my number one choice.	5star
The only good thing about this place is their pizza and spumoni... The pastas were ok.. nothing crazy and the service can be better.. One of the waiters came with the pizza and he spilled water on our table and just said a quick sorry and left, never came back to see if we were ok... he wasn't even our waiter... (the one with a deep voice and big muscle guy) Our waiter took a long time to come by to get our orders and food...	2star
Overrated. Definitely expected way more. Don't get me wrong the views from here are awesome and the minimalistic interior is great but not worth waiting about an hour to get inside. When we got inside, if we wanted to get a table we had to wait for an hour. So my group of friends and I decided to get drinks at the bar and just wait. The speciality drinks were not worth the price of $17. In addition to that, when i paid my bartender for the drink, he never gave back my change and just kept the money as his tip (even though i was going to give him a better one), until i asked for it back. Like okay? Rude. After our drinks at the bar, we got a text that our table was ready. Only to find out that they put us down for a table of 2 instead of a table of 5......... so that meant we had to wait longer for the next table to be ready. No thanks. After that I was totally over it. I would recommend this place if you want to wait super long for bad service and just okay drinks.	2star
Despite the raving reviews, I was very, very disappointed with Venessa's Dumpling - both this location (and even more so on their other spot on 14st). I had the normal pork dumplings. It was basically dumplings in Chinese fast food style - heavily Americanized, with a overlay strong flavor, way too greasy, and leaves a weird aftertaste. I know there are people who enjoy Americanized Chinese fast food, but I have to say it's not for me. I recommend the dumplings next door, at Shu Jiao Fu Zhou (I know it looks like it's falling apart, but the food there is legit).	2star
Good location. The food is okay, not bad but not exceptionally good. If you are a meat lover then this is a place for you. The moonshines are great. Reasonable price in this area. Should try at least once.	3star
Walked by this place a couple of times, finally stopped by to give it a try. For some reason, I thought there were more selections on their menu...The decor was super cute, outdoor seating was a little too tight. I felt like there wasnt enough space in between the tables. As for the food, I got the Zucca Vodka and Pancetta Sandwich. My friend got the Bucatini  Arrabbiata, we end up mixing our pastas together because we thought it tasted better that way. The spicy kick from the Arrabbiata taste so goooooood with the zucca vodka sauce. The pancetta sandwich was okay, wish it was a bit more savory. Overall, the pricing and portions were resonable. The pasta wasn't bad, I would come back to check out their bruch or if i'm around the area craving for pasta!	3star
Ugly baby isn't the for the faint of heart. Expect a ton of heat in all your dishes even the salads.  We didn't have a wait as we came here around 6pm on a Saturday night for dinner. There was definitely a wait when we were leaving so plan accordingly.  On to the food. Everything we got was good and different. I wish we'd known how spicy the dishes would have been but the server didn't advise us on this and only said one dish was spicy. Oddly enough the dish that was considered spicy was probably the one with the least amount of heat.  They were BYOB when we visited which made the bill very cheap. There were several beer and wine stores within a few blocks so we were able to take full advantage of this. Also trust me you'll need multiple beers to cool you down when trying the dishes here.	4star
Was there at 5:30pm few days ago as had 7pm theater tickets.  The place was almost full by 6pm. Food was good.  I ordered the chopped Salmon special but it was nothing special (no pun intended) as I like to order things I cannot easily make at home.  My friends fried chicken was very good.  the piece I tried was a lightly breaded piece of dark meat. Nice size salad.  Service was good. Good pricing on the bottles of wine.  First restaurant I went to that had no-tipping. I would come back but I won't wait more than 15 minutes.	3star
A somewhat-dark, homey cafe with a huge wall of hardbound books, wooden furniture, an alleged patio I didn't see (it was raining!), and nice folks behind the counter. I didn't go late enough for wine tasting, but did show up on a couple afternoons. I had lunch once - the white bean salad - and was surprised. I thought it would be a salad with white beans in it, but it was a spinach salad with slivers of red onion and tangy dressing, and two pieces of nice crusty bread with a sort of white bean hummus on them. Surprised, but pleased, and piling the salad on the bread was good too. A few days later, a buddy and I went to Milk and Roses to get some work done and have warm drinks. I got a hot chocolate, not realizing that their Italian hot chocolate is the Turkish coffee of the cocoa world. My friend described it as approaching pudding, which it practically does: it's got about the same thickness as a bisque, and will coat your spoon completely with a dark layer of chocolate. It's not sweet, and probably not a kids' drink (at least for kids used to high fructose corn syrup in everything). I actually ended up adding a packet of Splenda (there wasn't regular sugar on the table and I was too lazy to get up), which made it taste a bit strange; I should have asked for some extra milk but was too lazy to get up. The hot chocolate day happened to be Halloween, and I HIGHLY recommend hitting Milk and Roses next Oct. 31, because their music mix was AWESOME. Cartoon theme songs+Christian Death? Yesssssss.	3star
Wished we never had gone in here. Food mediocre, service horrible. Never got water I asked for like three times. Ughhh I can't even write about it. Terrible.	1star
Very small place that looked pretty authentic. The staff is nice and pleasant but the waiting time (once we ordered) was very long / not justifiable by the food we got. We ordered a ceviche and seafood with spicy sauce. The portions were very generous and had a lot of seafood. However, the food was quite bland and lacked a lot of taste: my best friend is Peruvian so I have a pretty good idea of the level of spices in this cuisine. Overall, I don't think the food was as good as expected, especially considering the reviews. I think there are better Peruvian spots in town.	3star
When my uncle decided to come here spontaneously for dinner one night, I was excited because I had wanted hand pulled noodles and have been looking at yelp at this location in particular. Given its 1000+ reviews with an average of 4 stars - I had high expectations. Firstly, I have eaten in plenty of hole-in-the-wall places (as they are my favorite.) However, I was disappointed by how small and crowded this space was. Also, what really irked me was the fact that there was a couple at a table that was meant for 6+ people. It was also prime dinner time so there was a slight wait too. My uncle, brother and I decided to sit at an open table that was basically meant for 2 but we managed to squeeze in - rather uncomfortably, might I say. All while the couple sitting at the 6 people table stared at us... Unbelievable. The food on the other hand was good. I got the beef stew with hand pulled noodles and the broth was very good. My uncle ordered the dumplings and it was good too. We enjoyed our food, but given the noodles and dumplings were good (read: the same as almost anywhere in Chinatown) next time, we would forgo this place. There is another hand pulled noodle in the area where you do not have to pay gratuity and have a better seating area.	2star
Extremely disappointed with the food in pearls!! Thought would have a real Caribbean taste but food bland and not authentic!! Nice vibe but did see a mouse run pass on table on left hand side of the outside tables . I do not think I will be returning back there but did travel all way from London as I heard so much!	1star
I love boil!!! The bag with seafood always surprise me and it's absolutely delicious. When I get craving for crawfish or seafoods in a bag that's what you can get from boil. There sauce is really good we always get garlic flavor with medium spice. I even went there to celebrate my 20 year birthday. Didn't need a cake the bag was my cake lol. The price range from $35-$55 but it's worth it trust me	5star
Not impressed. Had such high expectations and the food was incredibly ordinary. The steak tartar was boring and the worst I have had in a long time. Oysters were the best part. The fish was over salted and a bit over cooked. The fried chicken looked great but we were not in the mood. Lots of better choice. I will stick with blue ribbon sushi.	3star
Yummm wow I could drown in The Boil sauce and that would be a-ok. We showed up on a Thursday night and the wait was about 45 min for a table, which really wasn't too bad.  Both the hostess and the wait staff were super nice and helpful. We ended up getting the fries and corn as sides/starters, and I got the Dungeness Crab in The Boil sauce.  Hold crap it was so good.  Super meaty crab, and the sauce was buttery and spicy and perfect. Do NOT come here on a date where you're trying to look cute, though...you must wear a bib and gloves and you will still probably get sauce on your face and in your hair. Well worth it though! I will def be back!  I only wish they weren't cash only.	4star
My dad got very ill after eating here.  It kills me to give them one star, because the food was delicious and the service was the best I've experienced in NYC, but my dad's pork chop was undercooked and he spent one whole day on/over the toilet after eating it.  If you eat there, be sure that everything is cooked thoroughly.	1star
For some reason my friend recommended this spot on Labor Day. The waffles were amazing but the 2 hour wait after confirming it was a hour wait is ridiculous. The vegetarian chicken was horrendous, other than that the service was okay and the only thing I would return for are those light and fluffy waffles.	3star
They said it was their first day of brunch --new menu new chef... And they were out of/i.e. Not prepped to serve at least a quarter of the menu.  Maybe don't open till ready? When asked for mushrooms on omelette they came back and said they weren't ready... They had to save them for dinner. hint: use mushrooms for brunch, then go out and buy more for dinner service.  Entrées for two people arrived several minutes apart. Server never came back to see if everything was OK . We'd run out of cream for coffee and wanted salt and pepper.  Small things but definitely did not make for a great experience. food was OK at best.	2star
the low down: *CASH ONLY (there is an atm --- head to the back of the rest.)  There is also a chase atm 2 blocks down. lots of room to roll out with your buddies or cuddle up in a corner with your significant other.  plenty of mood lighting to look pretty in... but, not so conducive to food picture taking.   order:   Grilled Baby Octopus with Potato, Celery, Capers & Green Olives Whipped Ricotta, Mascarpone, Parmigiano, Walnuts & Honey (only comes with 2... so if you have more in your group.. you know what to do).  this was freaking delicious.  i could eat this all day. I forget the name of this one... but, it was a black pasta with assorted seafood.  The sauce on this was delicioussss! drinks:  the great saint!	4star
I came here without much expectation because this place seems like just another hype. But they proved me wrong! My bf and I walked in on an evening in the middle of the week and had to wait half an hour. I wouldn't recommend bringing a large group, more than 6, here because the tables are all pretty small and you'd be waiting forever.  Of course I had to try their Instagram famous adult Capri-sun with the led ice cube inside. I chose the Lychee & Mango flavor and it was pretty good, just enough amount of soju. The girl here recommended that we order 2-3 tapas. So we went for Kimchi Paella, Steak, and Popcorn Chicken. The Kimchi Paella itself deserves 5 stars!! It was so tasty, the flavor of kimchi and the smell from the seafood came great together. It's very creamy, more like risotto than paella. New addict! The Steak with grits was good as well but keep in mind it's cooked at medium rare and some pieces were even more on the rare side. So if it's not your type then you might wanna pass. The Popcorn Chicken was just average, I had it to-go.  The price of the tapas is very reasonable, around $10-$13/ dish. But the cocktail, which is the thing most people come for, is quite expensive. $11 for the adult Capri-sun. Staff is beyond attentive and friendly. Definitely come for paella!	4star
Let me say the food was good! The only reason this location received 3 stars was due to the lack of seating...there is NONE! Besides the two street benches and the concert divider of the cafe next door there is no where to sit. Also, the building houses another business that is in the front, so at first it's confusing to figure out you have to walk around the building to the back to find Luke's Lobster. Staff was good and efficient with quick order taking and cooking. They call your number and you go back for your food. I had the Taste of Maine, seemed like the best bang for the buck...i LOVED the crab roll the best! Shrimp was my least favorite. The pickle needs its very own review ...SO SO GOOD (but I love pickles)! Anyway enjoy.	3star
"This was the most disappointing meal we had on our trip. I noticed on Yelp and Trip Advisor there were mixed reviews for this restaurant - from those who raved to those who said to avoid at all costs. And I wish I had listened to the latter. First of all, the lack of line up should have tipped me off. It was around dinner time on a Tuesday, and the restaurant was maybe half full, even though there were supposedly hour long waits during peak hours. We looked upstairs as well as downstairs, so we had a pretty good look around the restaurant. Second of all, service was definitely lacking. No one brings you to a table once you enter, or even acknowledges you until you ask for assistance. For a place that seems to cater to tourists, that's a red flag. Once we were seated, the waiter was impatient with our questions. Yes, we're tourists, but if I need clarification on the menu, I should be able to ask without any attitude. He made us feel rushed, even though there were plenty of staff for a half-full restaurant. When our pizza came, we asked the waiter who brought it to take a picture for us. He made no eye contact and blatantly said, ""I'll get your server to do it"" and ran off. We ended up waving down our server to take a picture as he clearly did not pass on the message. We ordered a small pizza to share between the 3 of us, and 2 drinks. We got a standard red pizza with 2 toppings, which are an additional charge per topping. The pizza was okay. Not amazing, nothing special. The pizza by the slice my mom had near our hotel in Manhattan was better. The bottom wasn't crispy and the toppings were not abundant. It came out to maybe $20 for the pizza and $3 for each drink, for a final bill of around $26. Now, here's what got me to the 1 star rating. Upon paying for the bill, we noticed and expressed that it was a bit more expensive than expected. The cashier and waiter, awaiting payment, did not say anything. Looking closely, we saw a $5 charge although we didn't get anything that was $5. So, we asked what the $5 charge at the bottom was for. With lots of attitude and impatience, the cashier explained it was a service charge. They said that at the bottom of the menu they reserve the right to add a service charge. He said, and I quote, ""We get a lot of tourists here, we add a service charge."" This makes no sense whatsoever. I asked how the service charge was calculated - a percentage of the check? He rudely said it depended on the size of the party. From my calculation, $5 on a $26 bill is almost a 20% service fee. Ridiculous - especially because we had felt that the service was so lacking, they barely deserved a tip. The small print at the bottom of the menu did have the disclaimer, so we just paid and left. Just because an establishment decides to impose a service charge does not mean that they can treat their customers poorly. Searching Yelp reviews after this experience, I noted that many reviews said that this service fee is possibly illegal, as it is only allowed for large parties. We were a table of 3. Grimaldi's is clearly taking advantage of tourists who don't know the rules and laws. I would never eat here again and tell anybody who plans to visit Brooklyn the same. Luckily, just next door, there is a good alternative - next time I'll go for Juliana's, which was also recommended."	1star
"Ate there, food was good. I paid with a credit card that I only use when I eat out to get points. Hadn't used the card two weeks before eating at Black Swan. The next day after using the card at Black Swan I got all these fraudulent charges from Lyft and a gas station in Brooklyn. Clearly my card information was taken down at the restaurant as the card was still in my possession. After speaking with my credit card company to close the account, I called black swan and spoke to the manager Emma. After explaining the situation she responds ""no one here would do that"" -_- she took my information and said the owners would be getting in contact with me... it's been almost a week and nothing. Two thumbs down for them."	1star
So I've been wanting to try this place. A lot of good feed back from friends and it's always packed. The staff if really friendly made me feel like I was a regular there.  So I got the tacos. My favorite out of the 3 was the chicken. All were good had a great taste. The guacamole was fresh the sauce wasn't that spicy but still good. Tacos were a bit small but was worth it.  I also tried the Cuban sandwich. Great taste! First bite I had a taste of garlic then after I believed it was mustard. And that came with fries and those were really good.  Will come by again and try something else.	4star
Been several times - delicious homemade pastas, great setting, very reasonable prices. Had always gone on weeknights, and service was fine.  But went once on a busy weekend and they couldn't keep up (our four meals came out ten minutes apart from one another, some were cold, mistakes on our bill, etc.).  Noticed problems at other tables as well. Check it out on a weeknight, try somewhere else on a weekend.	3star
May be the worst food I've had in New York. I was honestly stunned. I almost wanted to bolt past the waiter into the kitchen to catch them pouring the Chef Boyardee. Pasta sauce was sugary sweet, pasta was gummy. Steak was tough enough to have been microwaved. Yikes. My guess is that the restaurant took a turn when ownership changed a while back. Someone get Gordon Ramsey in here ASAP.	1star
This is our second time at The Smiths for Sunday Brunch.  Word of Advice - get their early and try to make a reservation.  Place was packed when we arrived at 10:30am.  With a reservation, our wait time was an additional 10-15 minutes to get the table ready.   If you order on the left hand side of the menu, you can get a free drink with your meal (juice, passion punch, Bloody Mary and something else).  That's a pretty good deal considering the drinks are about 10-12 bucks and the meals can range from 15-25 bucks.   I got the steak and eggs.  Two eggs - sunny side up - well seasoned and cooked just slightly over.  Steak was peppery and is probably a  6-8 ounce filet.  Comes with this potato chive waffle that was a unique take on potatoes!   Wife ordered a Chicken sandwich and enjoyed it.  The shoestring fries were cooked perfectly and comes with this nice organic ketchup that you can get.   Pancakes are great as a table appetizer (they didn't have a monkey bread which was disappointing).	4star
Really wanted to like this place, as this is one of the newest additions to the neighborhood restos strip. But unfortunately everything we ordered at this place turned out to be underwhelming or plain bad. Ordered Satay chicken and sticky rice for our kid. Both chicken and rice were stale and definitely spent a few days in the fridge before ending up on our table. Sticky rice turned into a solid brick in about 10 minutes, and chicken was just bad. Noodles in soy broth with duck that I ordered tasted ok, but it had the smallest amount of meat I've ever gotten at any restaurant. There were literally 3 tiny pieces of duck in it that would fit in one large table spoon. Seriously? My wife ordered Masaamun short rib curry that (surprise) had 4 small pieces of meat and undercooked potatoes.  It's a shame that such a decent interior decor and a very pretty backyard garden are wasted on such crappy cooking. Avoid if you don't want to be disappointed.	2star
Cool place. Lots of options for food, drink, dessert, groceries etc. An Italian super store that is awesome to see. Pizza, pasta, fish, gelato, coffee, etc, there are so many options for any person (no matter how picky!)  I will for sure come back to try more food, just be warned most things are expensive!	4star
"Overcharged us by a ton! We went in with a group of 4. At the end the server told us (for two of us) out total was $40. It should have been closer to $32, and that's with tax and rounding up. We asked him to break down the costs for us, and he just said ""government, government taxes"" and wouldn't back down. So he overcharged us by $8 which isn't a ton of money, but is dishonest and rude. Food wasn't that great either. Egg rolls were WAY overpriced, spicy food not actual spicy at all, and noodles overdone or undercooked, depending on which side of the plate you picked from."	1star
Ordered a dish or two from each category: thai, viet, and malaysian. It's really good and I Love the food. Will definitely come back here if I am craving for anything thai, viet, malaysian!	4star
My husband and I decide to come to Becco for lunch . The service was nice the hostess did  come around to ask us how was our meal. The one thing that disappointed us in the end was the non-acknowledgment of why we were really there to have lunch.  I booked the reservations a while back on Open Tables and in the comments section  I type celebrating our  10th year wedding anniversary guess what it was not ever acknowledged. Made us wonder do they ever look on Open Tables in the comment section.	3star
wife walked by this place and couldn't believe a place like this existed so close to where she grew up - so we thought we'd give it a shot i have two serious issues with some of the other reviews a) i don't get what the big deal is with the back yard? - from some of the stuff i read i was expecting a full on Niagara, not a 3 foot high rinky-dink waterfall or whatever ... maybe i'm just upset that the stairs in the backyard don't make it very stroller friendly :) b) the bartender was one of the friendliest i've met yet - very knowledgeable and helpful the food was decent - but the fried stuff (clam strips and french fries) did repeat for a while - like stale fryer oil or something, and the burgers were far from organic, but considering they were $5.50 each and it was buy one get one free for Happy Hour - we walked away with decent food and two quick drinks at a great price and will definitely return!	3star
Decent overpriced food (the banchan was meh) well-spaced tables, loud environment. The service was efficient and friendly.  I came here with friends at 6p.m on Sunday and the place was full so definitely make a reservation before you go. Overall, we enjoyed our meal and I'm glad I tried but I don't think I'll be returning.	3star
Super friendly and quick service, even on a Friday night. We enjoyed the atmosphere and decor a lot. Very busy and crowded but we didn't feel overwhelmed or have to sit perched on other table.  The food was good. I'd say it's a very decent introduction to people who are not familiar with Korean food. Lots of fusion options but enough classic dishes to satisfy. The spicy rice cakes were good. The beef paella was okay, but probably our fault for not choosing the classic seafood option. Wine selection was just meh, but the soju drink was great and I would recommend for people who like their alcohol slightly sweet.	3star
Wow. First of all, I'm so happy they take reservations, given how busy this place seemed. We were a party of 4-5, on a Wednesday evening, and we didn't have any trouble booking a few days in advance. We picked Bea partially because their vegetarian options are plentiful, and as 3/4 of us were veggies, this place made sense.  I gave lack of one star because had I been hungrier, I would've ordered more food. My review for the food of this place is restricted to their tomato-based soup, which was delicious, but pretty average. We also ordered the house ricotta for the table to start - the dash of sea salt on there is incredible mixed with the honey! I'm intrigued to try the stuffed tomato dish. I'd love to come back here on a less busy day, or perhaps for brunch. Not to mention the decor is just absolutely adorable. Very cute & unique; this would be a great place for a date.	4star
This place is a gimmick.  Cheap quality, bad food at every level.  Will never return. Decidedly terrible food at this price point and considerable attitude.  With tip, wine bottle, one alcoholic drink, and food for one vegetarian (two vegetarian dishes were $24 and $28, respectively) and one carnivore with a 20% tip this about a $300 ticket.  At nearly $300 for two people, the joke is on the diner. *****They made us wait 20 minutes for our table, despite the fact that the dining room might have been 40% occupied when we walked in.***** The wait seems deliberate.  Perhaps they want to sell overpriced drinks at the bar while you wait, they want to appear exclusive, or perhaps both? Arrived about five minutes early for an early reservation (the place was empty). Hostess suggested getting a drink at the bar. I asked if the table was ready and she gave a curt reply that perhaps we would prefer otherwise to wait in the lobby. 15 minutes after the reservation was supposed to have been I ask if we should expect to be collected from the bar. She again gives a curt yes. 5 minutes later they escort us to a half empty dining room to our table. After a 17 dollar 2/3 pour martini and a $3.50 spray seltzer with generous helping of ice.  Chacuterie was good but I could get four times as much for a higher quality at the same price at Murray's cheese. Killer was, waiter offered, I did not ask, more bread for this small chacuterie plate: never got it.  For $41,  the suckling pig was warm at best. A couple minutes into it, it was cold. Not very good   I think that we can all agree that a $41 entree should be pretty good. The $95 wine suggested by the sommelier was fine.	1star
Great first time experience at Bea. I did an online search for a first date spot and this was perfect. The bar is spacious but also cozy. The food and drinks were delicious and i'll be glad to return. Great service from the host, bartender, and waiters as well!	5star
Took a date there at 11 pm and was told kitchen has closed early. In my humble opinion, it is poor business practice and disrespectful to your customers to randomly close early.  Anothe couple walked in after us, too.	1star
Zero decor, zero atmosphere, I felt like I was eating in an alley.  Dimsum took very long to arrive.  Nothing was good,  wasted $50. Look at my pictures for descriptions. Any place in Chinatown has better dimsum and chinatown already has mediocre dimsum compare to Flushing and Brooklyn.  Big disappointment.  I was so excited at first, will never go back.	1star
"Extremely overrated eatery with nothing but basic/plain Italian fare. Yelp really let us down on this place!!! My family and I were extremely disappointed with the service and food.  Food two stars: basic pasta dishes (penne w/ tomato, basil and meatballs & rigatoni w/ eggplant) that you can cook at home or get at any old halfway decent pizzeria/Italian restaurant. They have fresh pasta but apparently you have to ask for it (up charge). We tried to have switched to homemade pasta but our server said it was too late. If you make homemade pasta why do you serve boxed pasta? Meatballs absolutely sucked!...Too dense, no flavor...no frills meatballs.  Chicken entree was a bit better, but cutlets should have been pounded. The quality of chicken was a bit tough, although the sauce was decent. Best part of the dish was the grilled vegetables.  Wait service: two stars Asked about specials, but they weren't available. No one told us they have homemade pasta...found out from table next to us. When we tried to have switched, we were told it was too late. Also asked for kid size of pasta because our daughter can't eat an entire $18 bowl of pasta, but they couldn't accommodate.  I'd stay away from this ""Over Yelped"" eatery and head to one of the staples in Little Italy! We were looking forward to having a great Italian meal, but just got a run of the mill, average at best meal."	2star
The food was great. The service was horrible. Party of 20 with one server. Manager was not friendly or accommodating.	3star
horrible service, rude hostess, i called two hours ahead to make sure brunch is available before 4pm. I walked in at 3:25 with my whole family, rude hostess told us kitchen is closed. Are u serious?!?!!!! ugh!	1star
The service was atrocious... The food was middle of the road... Live on 36th and will keep walking up town  Was told by Yelp that this did not have enough detail Had reservation for a special evening... 3 servers in the place could not care for the 6 tables they had.  In all my days in NYC I have never had such bad service.  The 2 tables around us had the same reaction and we discussed how atrocious the care of the patrons was The food (the pork chop) was slime covered and pounded to a flat mess  The spinach salad was covered in mayo  The cheese polenta was not bad at all  The batched special cocktail was not good (Moscow mule) Would have been nice if the manager checked on us or any of the tables If you want a mediocre overpriced meal... Enjoy	1star
My girlfriends and I usually get together on Fridays for our weekly dinner but this one week we had to meet on a Thursday instead. Naturally, this meant we have to go to Thursday Kitchen which had I had bookmarked for ages. We arrived as soon as it opened, fearing the long wait that everyone in the others reviews warned us about and managed to be seated right away. The service is here is amazing. The waiters explained the menu to us in great detail, checked on us often and asked if anyone of us had any food allergies.  We ordered the following dishes to share (obviously because its tapas): Truffle Mac and Cheese - Bubbly, gooey cheesyness. Delicious with pieces of clams in it. A lot of the pictures here show the dish with the shell on but didn't come with the shells which made it easier to eat.  Korean Popcorn Chicken - Our server had described it as perfect blend of sweet and spicy because of the gochujang sauce and black sesame seeds. Was a bit disappointed with this because it just tasted like fried white chicken dipped in a gochuchang sauce. Very one dimensional.  Chicharron - A nice, crispy pork belly. Loved the white kimchi that came with it. Kimchi Paella - A combination of two of my favorite foods but it felt more like a risotto than a paella.  Ugly Potato - A genius combination of smoky BBQ sauce and feta cheese.  Seafood Pancake - Nice and crispy. Those who cannot handle spicy food shouldn't order this as there are serrano peppers chopped right in it. Steak - Favorite dish of the night. Hated the kale that came with it though because it sour. We all made a face when we tried it. Would've traded the kale for more of the feta grits which were amazing.  Also had the Thursday-Capri special drink. I ordered the Pure Jeremy which tasted like pure muddled strawberries.  Had high expectations for this place and unfortunately didn't love as many dishes I thought I would. There is also only one bathroom so there tends to be a long line.	3star
Is this place still open? It's the second time this summer I came all the way to Coney excited to have their food (loved them last summer). Last time there was a concert so you couldn't get in to the food truck without paying cover. Today everything is closed! Yet Yelp says it's open. Please mark this location as closed or update the hours as you are wasting people's time.	2star
I had the pork jowl, the crispy pata and the halo halo. I love me some Filipino food. I was thinking of doing my go to of sizzling sisig but the waiter recommended the pork jowel, so I gave it a go and was not disappointed. The jowl was served up with brussel sprouts, it was probably my favorite dish of the night. The crispy pata was also amazing but had a rough time keeping up with jowl dish. It was my first time trying the halo halo not my favourite but it was good, a bit watery from the shaved ice but still rich.  I would love to try it again and check out more of the menu. The vibe of the place is a bit Hipster-ish but the food speaks for itself.	5star
Not done noodles, bland taste. For the price this is not worth it, very confused because of the high rating it had before we went.	2star
Grew up going here. Fresh seafood...love the fried fish. Came back for a visit and was extremely disappointed at how dirty the place was.  They guys were standing by to take your trays when you finished eating but no one dared to pick up a broom or mop. I was also shocked it's still CASH ONLY!  Will go back again when I'm in town but if it's dirty again it may be my last visit.  I prefer eating in clean venues.   Gave it two stars because it was just dirty.	2star
Didn't have a good experience here. First off, our waiter disappeared after getting our waters and several waiters whizzed past us when I tried to grab them. There was also another table behind us who talked to their waiter the entire night about what to get and how life was going. They were extremely loud and despite me trying to grab a waiter, the waiter at the table behind us didn't offer to help. Nope. They just kept laughing and talking. I knew he was a waiter and not a customer because started explaining the menu and what he thought the ladies would like (he seemed to know them well as customers). There even came a point in the dinner that he poured LOTS of water or some sort of liquid (splashed on my legs) and proceeded to pour it in the bushes while the ladies at the table laughed. I thought this was extremely unprofessional given that the dinner place was a bit more upscale and less casual.  This whole experience going on behind me really affected my food as well. We got the clam pizza, sea bass, and the $1 oysters. Oysters were great and the price was very worth it (only offered at 8-10pm). The fish was also really good and flaky but the portion was a little small. Clam pizza is good for those who are hungry but the taste can get a little bland so we put Tobasco sauce on it.  All in all, I was really hoping for a better experience here. I read from other Yelp reviews that the service is great here so I got my hopes up...never again. I just can't believe a waiter would actually pour something in the bushes!! Even if you're trying to please your guests, that's going overboard.	1star
I am writing a review for this place because I feel disappointed about their food.  My friend and I din in on a Sunday night.  We order the green curry chicken and pad Thai chicken.  I think the green curry is lack of favor and so watery. The pad that is too salty.  Not going to come back.	1star
"Wow, this may be the first time Yelp has let me down in turns of expectations. I usually take reviews with a grain of salt, but seeing the high number of 4/5 stars for this place, I said why not, and came here last night with a friend. When we got here, we were quoted a 30 minute wait time by their friendly hostess, so we went to Snowdays for some pre-dinner dessert (I do what I want).  Once back, we were seated pretty much immediately. The interior of this place is very clean, with polished wooden tables set in either seatings of 2 or 4.  I went with their regular Kamo Seiro (Sauteed duck & cold soba - $17.75) while my friend got their regular Stamina Seior (Fried chicken & cold soba - $16).   Given how jam packed this place was, the service was pretty good (sure, the water could have been refilled a little faster, but I'll cut them some slack for that).  Anyways, everything was going fine until our food arrived.  Our soba sets arrived on a tray carrying the hot dipping sauce (with your choice of add-on/protein), a bowl of green onions and your cold soba noodles. The noodles were presented on a square wooden box (think big bento box), and while appearing substantial at first, turned out to be a paltry amount. It first looked like the entire box was filled with noodles, but at a second glance, you'll notice that the noodles are actually resting on a bamboo screen. There were just enough noodles to barely cover the surface of the screen, and if each strand were to be connected into one long piece, you can probably slurp it up in 10-20 seconds. Now I don't know about you guys, but that's definitely not enough food for a grown adult (or even a grown teen).   Anyways, moving on. The soba noodles were extremely bland by themselves (I get that the point is to dip it in your dipping sauce), but an additional garnish (crushed garlic, sesame oil, etc...) would have gone a long way to enhance the meal. The dipping sauce, on the other hand, was hearty - if not a bit too heavy. Then we have their sauteed ""duck"". A well crafted duck is among my favorite foods on the planet; and duck confit is usually my go-to order at ""fancy"" restaurants to use as a measuring stick. I don't know how their duck was made, but it was devoid of all flavors that made it duck (namely the gamey flavor I'm used to) , which is kind of the whole point in ordering duck in the first place... In fact, if this was a blind taste test, I would have guessed chicken or pork over duck 100% of the time. And my friend's fried chicken was no better, as the fried crust turned out extremely soggy.  We ended up paying $22 each with tax and tip, which while not too bad (this IS Manhattan that we're talking about), just didn't make sense for the amount and quality of food we received.  tl;dr - service and atmosphere on point, but food was lacking in amount, and consisted of indecipherable meat."	3star
I came to visit Habana Outpost on Thursday 9/8 evening with two of my friends.  This is my first time visiting.  I always miss out each year, since they close after summer is over. Anyways I ordered Shrimp Taco, Chicken Taco.  One friend had a quesadilla and the other had pork, rice/beans.  We all ordered the Margarita (which is the highlight of the review because it is so good). About 45min after consuming our meals, myself and one friend started to have some stomach issues (bubble guts), which we didn't pay much attention to.  It was only by the time we left (11:45pm) and got home that the intestinal issues begin. By morning, we all experienced intense gas, bloating, nausea and persistent diarrhea.  There definitely is some cross contamination with the meals we were served. I called and spoke to the Manager (Dee) to report the situation, she was very nice and considerate and she took my complaint and apologized for what happened and said she will review everything with the chef for the night.  There was also an employee their who was unprofessional, which I learned this person was terminated for inappropriate behavior Very disappointed with the experience (food wise), still recovering today.  If I decide to return, I will not purchase any food and just stick to their drinks AND also bring your own straw. The straws are not covered and easily dispensed which means random people's hands also touch straws you are placing your mouth on.  Maybe this is something they should consider, Covered straws (sanitary purposes).	2star
Very cool intimate atmosphere. Our server was pleasant and made some great recommendations on food. My wife enjoyed her craft cocktail and my beer was cold. The duck turnover app was solid and the sea bass entree was amazing! Would definitely go back.	4star
Large Yard, lots Of bottles, Boardgames and a String of Red Hook regulars. Food looked good.	3star
Not sure how this place received so many stars!  First off the waitress hardly cracked a smile.  She wasn't the friendliest person.  She was very curt.  I could've done a better job and I'm not in the service industry.    Anyways, the food was subpar.  We ordered the spicy dishes and if that's what's considered spicy, I know what's considered mild.  My friends ordered drinks with their order and I was in disbelief with the size.  So tiny!!!	2star
I used to go to Queens Comfort about 6 months ago, when I recently came back the only thing I could say is FROZEN. The captain crunch crispy tenders tasted frozen the crinkle cut fries tasted like the frozen ones you buy in key foods. Unfortunately this place may have been good in the past but they have definitely lowered their standards.	2star
For the people that only eat Halal meat this is not a place for you to eat the meat is not Halal..I only eat Halal and I ate there many times thinking it's halal meat I googled it and come to find out it's not halal so please leave a signed or something to let people that only eat Halal know it's not halal meat thank you	1star

Holy shit. This place is amazing. Came in on a Sunday for brunch expecting a wait, which was 15 minutes- but there were seats at the bar so we took those. Ordered Beignets to start. They were good, not super hot but still delicious. For mains I got the Eggs in Purgatory- it was amazing. Order this. Cheese Grits, Eggs, Creole Tomato Gravy all bakes with Parmesan on top. This description doesn't do it justice. Order it. My friend got the Crab Cake Benedict; it too was amazing. Service at the bar was good- food came out quick and was absolutely delicious. The only problem we had was because the hostesses (who were very nice) at the restaurant kept bumping into our chairs while we were eating. While I realize this is super minor it kept annoying us. Definitely recommend and will definitely come back!	5star
In a nice atmosphere, our meal started with a desultory waitress with a chip on her shoulder finally condescending to wait on us. The whole wheat bread with evoo and capers was good, but the positives end there. Ordered a Pizze Bianche Contadina. Bland is giving it too much credit. The crust was soggy and droopy, although with nice smokey undertones. Be warned, even though the menu lists smoked Mozzarella, there was none to be found on my pizza. A very meager sprinkling of crumbled sausage, a few tiny bits of eggplant, and evoo. That's it. Basically soggy bread with a very few flavored salty bits. My friend's Avocado Gamberetti salad was decent.	2star
I live in NYC and usually go grocery shopping in Chinatown every weekend. I go past many Italian restaurants in Little Italy all the time ; but never actually tried any of them. After checking the reviews on Yelp, My roommate and I decided on this place since they pride themselves on highly fresh and great quality food.  Totally a disappointment. We each spent $50 / person for their horrible frozen Carpaccio (a thinly sliced piece of frozen really pale-looking frozen beef on a bed of arugula), and some seafood Entrees that were not fresh at all. The Carpaccio came out looking so pale and frozen for a long time (old frozen beef...ugh) , even the taste clearly gives it away.  I got the Special sesame-crusted Snapper topped with Shrimps .... the Snapper was overcooked, chewy and dry. The jumbo shrimp on top was also very very overcooked. It was so dry and flavorless , I lost all my appetite. My roommate got the Penne di Pesce (seafood with Penne pasta in a creamy tomato sauce). The mussels and scallops tasted spoiled and frozen. My roommate gave up on his entree half way through the meal.  The service was great even when the restaurant was very packed. Very nice and friendly servers .... but the food did not live up to their reputation. And the prices are way over the top for Frozen spoiled Seafood.  I left feeling cheated. I'm sorry but I won't be trying any other Italian restaurants in Little Italy anytime soon. They are really just for tourists.....	1star
I regret giving a place like Barn Joo 35 a poor review. Perhaps I had bad luck with ordering, but neither times I visited worked out well for me. I stopped here for dinner once on a weekday, and once for lunch on a weekday. Both times I visited indicated that the popularity of BJ35 hasn't waned at all since it's opening. Despite K town having a strong presence in Manhattan, there aren't many places around like BJ35, which are pushing the envelop when it comes to your traditional Korean dining experience. The first time I came here for dinner, the wait was long, but not as bad as some places that I've visited. We ordered four items, including the sweet flavored fried chicken, the truffle fries, kimchi pancake, and one of the soup dishes with mussels, bread and a spicy broth. The mussels in the spicy soup was pretty good. My friend loved this one. However, all other three dishes fell flat, especially the truffle fries. This whole 'truffle fry' thing has taken NYC by storm, similarly to the poke craze, in that everyone serves them now. However, like many places, BJ35 doesn't use nearly enough truffle oil to have these qualify as truffle fries. They're more like fries with truffle aroma.  Call me picky, but if you're going to sell truffle fries, they ought to actually taste of truffles. ___________________________________________________ When I visited for lunch, I placed one order of the Seafood Kalguksu, which cost $14. It was marked as a seafood soup noodle with seafood broth, which I was looking forward to because I was sick. However, the broth was quite disappointing with no particular flavor. The only seasoning I could taste in it was pepper.  The actual dish itself was also disappointing. There are several mussels and clams, as well as some squid in the dish, so I would say there was a fair bit of seafood. However, There were probably almost no noodles at all featured, so I wound up leaving the restaurant still hungry. I don't think they're purposefully stingy with the noodles, because I saw a lot of other people order dishes with quite a bit of food. Rather, I think it is this dish IN PARTICULAR which needs work. The seafood kalguksu is a little bit of a mess because it is difficult to eat, and shells of both the mussels and the clams constantly get in the way of you trying to eat the dish. A solution to this could be to de-shell the clams etc before cooking the dish, but I understand that keeping the clam shells in the soup adds to the freshness of the dish in terms of appearance and taste. Still, if the trade off is freshness vs. convenience, I think they could afford to sacrifice a little bit more of the former. I may come back again, because I want very much to like BJ35, but if I do, it will only be if I happen to be in the area. I'll also be ordering completely different dishes. A final complaint is that the website for BJ35 is slightly useless, since it doesn't feature a menu, and only redirects you to other pages which have no menu; this also includes an instagram page with 0 posts.	2star
"This was a great dinner spot to celebrate my friend's 40th.  Our main waiter was great, until he wasn't, and by that I mean he disappeared for break it something without a word to us. This was after he pitched his stand up act complete with flyer type post cards. I'm used to being ""passed' to the stand in. That didn't happen.  The all you can eat pasta option was great for some at our table, but we frequently had to ask for a little more of this or that. The food was excellent and well priced. The atmosphere was good, not amazing, but typical of any Italian restaurant in this part of Manhattan. I would return, but it probably wouldn't be my first choice."	3star

DIED and went to Mac n cheese heaven! Everything here was sooooo tasty but the true star-stealer was their creamy, heavenly truffle mac n cheese-- so good we ordered two. We couldn't quite nail down the taste cause it was nutty (bechamel we wondered?) but just trust me, order it. Kimchi paella was so delish too and we were stuffed after 3 dishes even if they are tapas-style. Took the rest home and still heated up nicely the next day.  No wait when we came cause we came early! :) Can't wait to come back! Also service was phenomenal! Again that NYC unicorn trifecta of superb food + decent prices + awesome service.	5star

I came here yesterday with a friend after attending a taping at The Chew. We had mulled cider wine which was delicious. We ordered empanadas, meatballs, and bravas. Bravas were good but empanadas and meatballs lack the spice everything tasted mild. We then ordered the orange vanilla flan which we thought would have more of a creamsickle taste but it did not regular flan with sour oranges on top that tasted more along the line of grapefruit. The presentation and how the dishes were prepared were all nice and our waiter Kevin was very attentive so I would come again but maybe for drinks and dessert only.	3star
"Great ambiance, but the food portions were really small and overpriced. Menu is limited so this is not a good place for vegetarians.  Service is excellent and everyone there truly cares about presentation and the ""experience"" customers get, most of whom are probably eating Laotian food for the first time. They encourage diners to share plates and make it more of a family style experience than ordering individual plates. We started with the sticky rice with the bang-bang and eggplant sauces (both excellent). Our party additionally ordered the chili prawns, pork noodles, quail, lemongrass chicken, and a couple other dishes I can't remember. All the dishes with the exception of the lemongrass chicken were excellent. The lemongrass chicken sausage was really small and the accompanying salad was pungent and frankly, hard to eat. This was easily the worst dish and the chicken sausage itself was too small for even one person, let alone to be shared.  My biggest gripe here would have to be portion sizes which are not on par with the $$ you're paying per dish. The quail dish was the only one where I felt like the portion size was adequate - but that dish is hard to share. Most of the ""family style"" dishes just were too small.  Overall - it's okay but I won't return. I've been here twice (first visit was back in 2013 or 2014) and the menu has changed and possibly gotten smaller. A little more extensive menu would be helpful."	3star
Was my go to place for a good meal & drinks with friends... I recently went with another friend & got dinner and the happy hour special for drinks. Meal was good. At the end, they try to charge me $12 for 2-for-1 drinks during happy hour, making the liquor a separate charge. Even their cocktails are $10 2-for-1. Not cool at all. I comment and say, 'Nope, been here before with friends & my drink that I make has always been $6, even when it's not happy hour.' My drink goes down to $9, I complain again. They said 'Oh, you made your own drink and it has two alcohols in it.' Effin-A. Other places I've been to during happy hour put two alcohols in their drinks and they don't do a separate charge for liquor. Hell, they don't do it during non-happy hour times either *sigh* Really? I don't think so. Pet peeve: When restaurants aren't consistent with how much drinks cost. Different person & day, different price? That's shit. Don't play me for a damn fool.  I'll be parkin it elsewhere where they have consistency and no game-playing with their drink prices.	1star
Love, love, love.  Extremely fresh ingredients, and great location! We ordered a salad, and two large pizzas for four people. We ate everything, and left feeling completely satisfied. Maybe overdid it with the amount of food, but no regrets here!! Thanks, will be coming back!	5star
Stopped in after seeing a play on Broadway, nothing fancy, kind of old, needs to be renovated, but because it's a restaurant in the theater district it's packed and I recommend reservations. The food was good, service was robotic, very good cocktail menu from bar, but it is so damn loud, lots of kids I guess because it's Christmas week and they are all off from school.  I would recommend going to 9th Ave and look for a place to eat there, away from the theater crowds.	2star
My friend recommended us this place so we made reservations for Sunday brunch before we left the city. I ordered the popover because it seemed like one of the intriguing items on the brunch menu. It was nice that they gave us each a complementary brunch drink with our meals :) they also checked out luggage while we ate. Great service for sure! My popover though was alittle disappointing.  I liked the Gouda cheese with the eggs and it came with plenty of eggs and meat stuffed in a popover but it was like something I could make at home. Maybe I should have ordered something else but I thought it was too much food piled in a popover that is just okay. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food though :)	3star
Didn't eat here, ended up leaving. I booked a 3pm table for brunch online on a Saturday ... I arrive to be told they stop serving brunch at 3pm and have a limited menu (very limited) before switching to dinner menu at 4. Boo. Everyone knows brunch lasts all day on the weekends in New York. Also there was no mention of this on their website or in the email confirmation for the reservation. Epic brunch fail.	1star
The space is really cool. I love the sketchy walk up the stairs to the second floor. However, it was Loud as F%#* in there. We tried the sausage stew hoping for something spicy and delicious. It is as basically a bunch of lunch meats thrown in a pot with ramen. Hmmm. Really liked the lighting.	2star
Awesome vibe and atmosphere young crowd and hilarious host who may be one of the nicest guys I've seen out. Seems to have a real love for Japanese culture and the food is authentic. The drink special is very good, and easy to over indulge in.	5star
Mixed feelings about this place. I went there with my husband on a Saturday for lunch. We were literally there 2 mins before they officially open. They told us they were not open yet, which is fine. I told them we'll sit in the waiting area until they're ready. Keep in mind, I was 8 months pregnant and it was over 90 degrees that day. They told me I can't sit here for 2 mins until they open and that I have to wait outside in the heat with no shades anywhere. My husband was so upset and decided not to wait. Not sure why the door was not locked and by the time we were done talking to them, it was already 11am, which is when they are supposed to be open.  We live in the neighborhood, so I decided to give it a try by myself since my husband refused to go back. It was a weekday afternoon around 2pm. I ordered the mushroom tacos with avocados. They also brought me water with mint. The mushroom tacos were amazing! Food was excellent. Service was great that day. However, the water they brought me had dirt floating around in it. Not sure if it was because they didn't rinse out the mint before putting it in the water. I ended up ordering a coke instead.  I told my husband that I had a better experience but he still refused to go back.	3star
"While the place does offer and point out their ""vegetarian"" options by putting a green leaf next to the item on the menu, when I asked if the fries were vegan, there was an rumble of ""there's no meat in them! There's no meat in potatoes!"" -which is a huge red flag to a vegan or a vegetarian. Just because an item doesn't contain meat, doesn't make it automatically vegetarian or vegan- it also matters how you cook it, and the items here are most likely cooked in the SAME things that the meat is cooked in- so I would be very wary eating here :c"	1star
Ok. I have read reviews before that said do not trust yelp reviews and in this case I must admit that I will never again. Most of the reviews for this place was very good more than 3.5 stars and favorable comments. So I went to try for myself!. Ummmm drum roll and GREEEEEESSSSSSY!!!!! (Yuk). Seriously wanted to love this place especially after looking at those mouth watering pictures but that's as far as mouth watering as it gets. This place is GREEEEEEEESSSSSY! I mean I kept stopping my car to spit because I didn't want to swallow the grease on the roof of my mouth and tongue. Even writing this I feel so disgusting because it feels like the grease is still going in. Oh and $9.99 for super oily fries that are so fried out that you are only eating crispy oil?. Then the greasy so called half a chicken which when it came could only be half a pigeon because it was so small for $12.99. So you don't get the chicken and the fries together like every other place in the world. Oh NO.  These guys thought it would make more money sense to rip you off by charging for the fries extra. (Ha). I would not recommend it even if you were super wasted and didn't know where your ass was from your dingdong!. Good luck eating folks..........	2star
Solid Italian food for the area, primarily the entrees. We had a reservation for a party of 5, which may have been necessary given the size of the group and the general busy-ness of the restaurant, which was a little surprising given its location in the city. We split the octopus and the fried artichoke to start, which were well prepared and fairly tasty, while I had the fusili as my entree, which was quite tasty and fairly well portioned given its cost. The tiramisu and the cheesecake desserts were also fairly light and tasty. I found the wines to be a bit on the pricier end and the meal a bit costly, but overall it was a nice meal and worth coming back to if you're in the area and craving Italian food.	4star
Heard so much about this place., so disappointed ...  ordered the halibut, it was cold and tasteless... my friend ordered some kind of pasta. It was very bland and tasteless.  The lamb dish was very good good. We ordered a lot of things the only thing that stood out was the lamb. And I have to say service was excellent. Our waiter was very attentive and helpful. But for the price. I expect great food and great service.maybe this place was good once.But definitely not the case anymore. Ok. Ok	2star
These guys give Colombian food a bad reputation. Awful, just awful! I have actually been here a couple of times and every time I get upset because I feel like I've been scammed. This time I have to write a review, because a 4 star rating is very deceiving. What the owners of this establishment need to do is make a trip to Colombia, taste how real Colombian food should taste, and then hire someone that knows what Col food is. Avoid this place in the mean time.	1star
Pizza was salty and thin and the crust was burnt! I ordered this through UberEATS and paid $42 for this pie.	1star
I have been to this location with the bf once and once to the previous location. This is his favorite Korean fried chicken place and he wanted to take his friend from home here.  It really is a unique take on fried chicken. The breading is very different I want to describe it as a pillow around the chicken almost rather than just breaded meat.  I prefer the soy to the spicy.  This is a neat little establishment.	3star
Their soup dumplings, pork, crab, and black truffle, are fantastic. Fabulous scallion pancakes too! Cash or American Express only.	5star
"Thai Villa is a relatively new restaurant located near the union square. It is tastefully decorated with traditional Thai elements that can't be seen from outside of the restaurant. I have been to many Thai restaurants in NYC before and never have I seen anything so extravagant. (looks like everything are made of gold... lol) The food was Thai fusion and presentation-wise they all look amazing. I won't say that their food taste much better than other Manhattan Thai restaurants but their plating and atmosphere is definitely a thousand time better.  For appetizers, I ordered the ""Ray Rai Nah Phu"" which has minced shrimp, crab meat and rice noodles wrapped around with some sort of leaves. It was a little on the dry side and the portion was definitely too much for the two of us.  For entree, I had the ""Ho Mok Ta Lay"" which has seafood curry served inside a coconut shell. I can tell that the seafood was really high quality and fresh. The dish was the highlight of the night.  This place is perfect for an romantic date or a gathering for a small group of friends. Oh yea, and for those Instagram foodies too! Tips: + make reservation as it gets crowded on the weekdays too + their appetizers portions are quite big, good for a group of friends + I recommend to try their desserts, they are great + Pricey comparing to the other Thai restaurants in Manhattan"	4star
This place was ok. Super cute idea and we were super excited to try a new pasta place! They have a small sitting area outside and a few tables inside. It seems like more of a take out or quick eat place.  We ordered 4 pastas for the 2 of us and admittedly went a little overboard, but wanted to sample a bunch. Unfortunately, it seems that taking the pasta to go either dries out the sauce or there isn't much sauce to begin with. I do know that traditionally pasta is not drenched in sauce, but I guess when it's ordered for take out, more sauce should be added because for the bites that did have sauce, the dishes were amazing! We got the truffle pasta, fettuccini Alfredo, pasta with sweet corn and the spicy pasta. The added sauce would have changed the whole experience, but sadly we were just eating dry pasta. Our ride home was also only about 15 minutes.  I would try them again, but perhaps request more sauce for the travel time.	3star
"Bottom line, the food was good. It was actually really good and we really enjoyed it. I took two stars off for the service.  Not sure what really happened but our food came very late. A family sitting next to us who had ordered after us and received their food and nearly finished before we had received ours. After waiting for 20min, they came back out to confirm what we had ordered.  This is what made me really upset. I opened my napkin to use it, and a mint was half eaten and tucked inside. When I told the waitress, she didn't even apologize, just went ""Oh"" and gave me a new one, completely unphased by the situation and handled it so poorly. Both me and my friend were very disgusted. Good food, thumbs down for cleanliness and terrible service."	3star
Just thinking about the food again makes my mouth water! Mint Lemonade- Sweet and delicious with a strong minty aroma. One of the best lemonades that I've ever had. ($2.95) Breakroom Burger- Angus beef, pork belly, sunny-side up egg, American cheese, lettuce, tomato, jalapeños, and pickles. Wow, what a fantastic burger. ($9.95) Breakroom Fries- Seasoned fries, tater tots, sunny-side up egg, bacon, cheese, jalapeños, and scallions. They were insanely flavorful. I'm coming back for more! ($6.95) This place is rather small and fills up quickly, but it's definitely worth the visit.	5star
Pretty simple taco place. You walk in order your taco, give the receipt to the worker in the kitchen and tell them what toppings you want on it (I just said everything). There aren't chairs just tall tables for standing. The tacos are pretty good for the price.	5star
Ok, so I'm late to the game on this one. This is not your usual NYC pizza.  It's a little thicker, pan style pizza, but no as think as deep dish (which I don't care for).   Food/Drinks:  Mixed Green salad - very simple and fresh (but obviously not the reason one would come here).  Old Fashioned Pizza with Pepperoni and Sausage - it's amazing and really some of the best pizza I've had in awhile.  It's perfectly cooked and the pepperoni and sausage are perfectly seasoned and cooked.  It's cooked on the well-done side, which I prefer.  This pizza is very filling.  I can typically only get two pieces down.  I also ask for extra marinara sauce to dip the edge of the crust in.  They have a decent wine and beer selection for a pizza place.   This place is worth going out of your way to the Financial District, if you are not in this area already.  It's even better if you get to seat outside. Stone St is great on a nice day.  We have been here a couple of times and it's definitely on my repeat list, not to mention it's right around the corner from Dead Rabbit (two for one!!!).	5star
this is an overpriced and kind of ugly, italian-american restaurant. expect the usual upscale family restaurant you might find anywhere in the us. had steak with macdonalds fries and whipped mash potatoes. desserts are diner compatable. williamsburg has much much better.	1star
Awesome Thai food. I shared the roti canai planta (pancake), mee goreng with chicken and veggie Thai fried rice. Also had Thai iced tea. The mee goreng was a little spicy for me but overall I enjoyed everything. They also give you a ton of food! Friendly service, too.	4star
Buttermilk Channel is a well known brunch spot in Brooklyn but it's out of the way for me so I haven't had a chance to try it until today, which happens to be New Years day 2017. We arrived around 1:11 and put our names down for a table of four, we were estimated an hour and fifteen minute wait. We were seated at around 2:50. For any well known brunch place in NYC during prime time, that wait is pretty normal. They take your phone number and text you when it's time for you to come back and especially if the weather is nice it's a cute area to walk around. I just suggest having this in mind - that this place will have some kind of wait, probably at minimum like 30 minutes.   All of this is to say, we weren't angry or surprised by the wait, but what was pleasantly surprising was how kind the hostess was to our party. Though we were seated pretty much around the same time she estimated the wait would be, she was super apologetic and even gave our party complimentary drinks. We didn't have to mention this to our waitress after we sat, ordered, or ate, we received the bill and the waitress confirmed at that time the drinks were on them. This service was really exceptional, which is something you don't get at every trendy restaurant in the city, and I appreciated it a lot.  The Food - I ordered the short rib hash, my boyfriend ordered the fried pork chop and cheddar waffles. We also ordered a short stack of pancakes to share (because what better way to start the new year?)  The good: My eggs were cooked perfectly, the pancakes are seriously divine.  The kind of average: I think that my food may have suffered as a result of our table being one of the last ones served (they end brunch at 3 pm) - I felt that my food was over salted, the hash was rather dry and tough, and even the vinaigrette on my side salad was quite salty. The cheddar waffles seemed to be normal waffles, not cheddar ones, or the cheddar flavor didn't come out very well. Also, the pork chop was a little dry and sort of tasteless. That said, for both meals, the perfect bite where you get a little bit of everything was quite tasty, but I can't say that each component of the meal stood out on their own.  The star of the day was absolutely the pancakes - slightly crispy but big, fluffy, and soft in the middle - the perfect receptacle for some butter and syrup. I would definitely make the trip and wait again for these pancakes, which are truly crave worthy.    Ultimately, this isn't a place that I may often go to because the distance plus the wait are pretty large. That said, I can absolutely see me craving these pancakes once in a while and braving any storm to get them. The restaurant is cute and the service is really so stellar that I certainly recommend this as a spot for any person (especially a pancake fan) to try at least once.	4star
Great experience here, high quality fresh lobster, generous portion, well seasoned, nice staff. Nice summer spot, just go...	5star
I've been here for dinner and was not too impressed. But because I like the idea of this place so much I am willing to try their brunch, which I hear is amazing.  To be continued....	3star
Came during lunch.  Place was pretty much empty.  Lots of open tables by the water.  Asked waitress to be seated by the water.  Waitress says there's not enough waiters or something along the lines of that and seats us(2) on a large table for 4+.  The next couple after us gets a table by the water.  Really ruined our first experience here for the price of this place. Go figure.  Food was decent, curry was good but the string beans and chicken were very dry.	1star
"This place is going down hill and it is a shame to see, since I used to love coming here, but now I think I will only be back for their edamame. I have been telling E that I prefer this restaurant more than Traif, because I tasted more exciting things here like my favourite are the edamame (I know, but they're the best thing ever - super well seasoned) and the grilled carrots ""elote,"" honey butter, lime crema, coriander, feta, dill. This time around the edamame were just as good as before, except on my birthday. Carrots failed this time around, it wasn't good and I felt like I am losing my credibility when restaurants are not consistent with their food. We got the tasting menu, and soon I regret it, because we weren't getting great food and E is probably wondering why is this place better than Traif. CHARRED octopus, pluots, asparagus, carrot-coriander, guajillo, spicy quinoa salad - this was good and refreshing. carnitas of pork belly & cheeks, Fava beans, black trumpets, pasilla-pulque-prune - the pork belly was a bit dry and it made it too heavy to eat. Braised duck lettuce wraps, mushrooms, picadillo, raisins, peanuts, roasted banana - good foie gras al pastor, roasted pineapple, torrejas, costeno honey, chipotle-pineapple - still my favourite, but last time the foie gras was really gamey during my birthday meal that people couldn't even eat it. scallop ceviche, tomatillo-habanero aguachile, hearts of palm, avocado, iced tomato - I really think they should take this off of the menu, the way the scallops are done, it's just not good. I miss the good charring of a well cooked scallop. This taste is just unsettling and it is just a waste to keep it around. We also got this chicken dish, it wasn't bad, but it didn't speak to me and thank god it wasn't dry. Then we had this other noodles with sausage dish that I have never had before, it looked like a hot mess, but it was decent. I need to remind myself to stick to the reconstructed cocktails, never get the de-constructed cocktails here, because E got the pomegranate and I got the cucumber, and jalapeno one and they both were disgusting. Seriously, my tasted like a green juice with no alcohol and so our second drink, E got the Blueberry Swizzle and I got the Watermelon margarita. They haven't been consistent with delivering out great food when I first came here back when they first opened - they should definitely fix this."	2star
Stick with the Happy hour oysters! Oysters were varied, good and priced well - the rest of the experience was a disaster - beyond noisy ( 5 bells) super over/priced drinks- terrible service - we waited over an hour for food after the oysters were served. Many Billyberg hipsters are there who seem to prefer the retro raucous atmosphere over any type of professional service. Leave after the oysters.	1star
Just stop in for some take out . Order 1/4 pork belly , beef brisket & burnt ends . With a Phillycheese beef brisket sandwich . I'm kinda wishing that I would have ate it at the restaurant. By the time I got my food home , the meat was all dry .I didn't enjoy it @ all . So I will come back and try it again . But over all the restaurant and staff was ok . I all so found out that my free side order from yelp , I couldn't use it because I order take out .until I go back I will have to give it a 3 star . I wasn't blown away at all .but i will go back .	3star
A bit disappointed. Looks are definitely deceiving. The reviews on here are old & the menu has changed. I had the Luke's Trio which includes 1/2 of all three; crab, shrimp, lobster. Do not waste your money. They are small & I found the crab meat to be super salty, the lobster roll was tasteless not like your normal lobster roll. Before they a trio that included all three with a drink, side of chips and or pickle which costed more but I'm assuming worth it. (Before $24.50 Now $19.50) Honestly the best part or the rolls was the buttery toasted buns. My coworker had a cold drink that's was pretty gross in her words. They do have a lobster Mac & Cheese that I wanted to try but after today's experience I might just take that thought back!	1star
Tried this place for the first time. We were the only ones there.    Our original order with the young lady was lamb tagine, moussaka, chicken kabob entree, 2 pies and 2 snapples. She told me that there might not have moussaka but she'll let me know.  Another woman came over to tell us there's no more lamb.  So we went with the chicken tagine.  I had to asked her about the moussaka. She didn't know and asked the young lady. It was determined that they didn't have it.  So we went with the fish tagine. I figured that they had chicken in Stock so I did not ask about the kabobs. So far we had been sitting there for a good 15 minutes with absolutely nothing on our table.  My husband finally asked for water and our snapples.  No apologies for the wait.  Young lady just got up from playing on her phone and got us water and asked anything else? I said our snapples. She said I know and then went outside to buy from another store.  She came back with peach flavored.  Luckily we like that flavor.  Finally the food came which is why I gave 3 stars. Both tagines, although tasted the same except different proteins, were delicious.  So flavorful and the rice was great with it.  Great value at 10.95.  The 2 pies came but none of us liked it.  Very greasy.  My husband, daughter and I shared the two entrees as we waited for the kabobs to come.  It never came but we were full and decided not to say anything at this point.  It baffles me that the young lady did not write it down since i even turned to my 10 yr old daughter to tell her that I'm ordering rice instead of fries for her entree. Was this girl daydreaming the whole time?? I was very angry at the service during the whole meal but tried to  remain calm.  It's not that they weren't nice but just really poor service.  Water should be a no Brainer. I really want these little places to succeed in our neighborhood.  Please improve service and continue the wonderful food!  The food kept me from giving 1 star!	3star
Nice decor and good sound system.  Cocktail was ehh (maybe it was just the bartender) Guac was the best part Pork sliders sucked  Bartender didn't ask once if we liked our food or if we wanted another drink. Overpriced.  Good luck I'll stick with iguana	3star
Incident is appropriate. They forgot half of my order for delivery and despite being open for another hour decided against trying to fix it. Order from Supper, much better food and won't waste your time.	1star
Atmosphere, drink and the waitress were really nice. The food on the other hand could have been better. It seemed like our meal was rushed, because the fried chicken was not fully cooked and the Bake mac & cheese wasn't boiled all the way, it was a bit chewy. Their deviled eggs were a bit over priced($9) for just 2 boiled eggs, but the French fries were on point. I would definitely go back for their drinks!	3star
I would say closer to 3.75 rounded up to 4 stars. I'm only upset because the portions were smaller than I had expected and I wanted more. So there! (But really though).  We came for brunch on a reservation. I had been eyeing this place for the sizzling sisig plate ($16) and it did not disappoint - only that again, it was smaller than I had imagined it to be! Coconut rice was not offered on the brunch menu - so I went with the jasmine ($3), but they also have garlic fried rice and I would venture to try that on another occasion! My friend ordered the steak and eggs ($17) and my! That was a delicious (also small), plate of brunch food! On top of that - bottomless mimosas!!! (additional $15!). You know I had to sign myself up for that! They have your regular orange but also lychee, white peach, and mango! ALL delish! I believe white peach and mango were the favorites, but just try them all and tell me what you think!  So by the time we're a few mimosas in and have pretty much finished our meal - both of us were still feeling slightly unsatisfied - this meal didn't hit the spot for us. It was delicious but - something was missing. And that is when we ordered the brioche french toast. HOLY CRAP. I didn't think I could enjoy such soggy goodness, but it was a syrupy delight and that put us where we wanted to be (with a few more mimosas of course). I wasn't ecstatic we had to order another course, but I was kind of happy we did. That's what I mean about the brunch portions! Overall - still glad to check this place off my list and will probably visit again with more realistic expectations of what I'm getting (aka really delicious, but maybe have a snack or something before or plan on a dessert after! Just being real!).	4star
We had high hopes for Casa Enrique and were very excited to go to dine at our first Michelin star restaurant. I made reservations online and we arrived right on time. The place was tight and very crowded but we were seated right away. The decor and interior is very nice and clean and had a nice vibe. Our waiter was friendly and came over for our drink orders. Everyone ordered beers and I ordered a jalapeño pineapple margarita. The drinks were brought out in a few minutes and my margarita was quite spicy but strong. We ordered guacamole and chips and ceviche for our appetizers which came out about 10 minutes later. The guacamole and chips were very good. The guacamole was nice and thick and each chip was basically a half of a tortilla. The chips were so good we asked for more and ate them with the sauces that were on the table; mild, medium & hot. The medium was my personal favorite. I didn't like the ceviche at all unfortunately and I had been so excited to try it based on the reviews. It was way too sour in my opinion but that was my first taste of a white fish ceviche but it did look beautiful. For dinner we ordered 3 tacos, a torta, and I ordered the chicken enchiladas en salsa verde and the enchiladas en mole. The tacos were ok, nothing special, the tostada was an average tostada, again, nothing special. The enchiladas both had bland, unflavored chicken inside and the mole sauce was below average but the salsa verde sauce was delicious. For about $200 and 1 Michelin star, we expected more and will not return.	3star
Given the price tag, Trattoria has everything I have asked for - relaxed feeling, decent pasta, and good wine. Our group of five came here right after they opened at noon and the restaurant was already filled with crowds. While we were served a bit slow (understand that part, given the crowd at brunch time), we really enjoyed the squid ink pasta with assorted seafood.  Tried their tiramisu towards the end - smooth and not too sweet, love it! Would like to come back and try others!	4star
Come here only for the Thai dishes!  Ordered the pho bo (beef pho) and pad kee mao. The beef was a bit tough and too chewy for my taste and there are other places that definitely make it better, so I would suggest avoiding the Vietnamese dishes and saving your stomach room for the Thai dishes.  The pad kee mao was delicious; it was a little spicy but not overwhelmingly. I would get this again if I come back.  Customer service was top notch. Wait staff kept an eye on our waters and kept refilling it without us asking for it.  The decor is beautiful, a perfect date night spot.	5star
Just go here - the food is excellent, the owners are friendly and welcoming, the atmosphere is just plain and unpretentious, and on the night I was there, the owner was buying everyone rounds of Jameson's : ) I had crispy fried chicken, which was excellent.	5star
Disappointing is the only word that comes to mind. I was in the mood for a good BBQ and after reading about this place and all the reviews decided to give this place a try. I will start with why only three stars : 1. Called and asked if it was busy, the person on the phone said they were okay today because of the weather and the wait wouldn't be too long.  When we got there the wait was around half an hour and the food coming out looked really good.  Once we were seated that's when the bomb dropped.  The waiter started reading down the list of everything they DIDN'T have. They were out of ALL RIBS, PORK BELLY, SAUSAGE.  Usually I don't mind and understand certain restaurants run out of things.  This is a BBQ place after all, so didn't quite understand, partly because this is Saturday night, and around 8 p.m.  Around 8:30 a couple sat next to us and they were told that they were now also out of BRISKET...I couldn't believe it. Now this place is opened till 12 a.m.  so I wonder what exactly do they serve. The other thing that really was not professional is not letting us know while we were waiting to be seated.  We waited 30 min. which is okay, but we know this place is popular and if I had to be on a waitlist and found out they didn't have most of the menu I would really be upset. 2.  Now for the food, we had brisket and burnt ends.  The food was okay, a bit dry, maybe because we got the end of everything.  A solid 3 stars but NO more, there are much better places in the city. The good part were the drinks, I had a jalapeño drink and it was amazing.   Overall, if you come early maybe you can try actual BBQ, but otherwise good luck if you are looking for a night out. This is in response to Kathy. Just to be clear, I fully understand that restaurants run out of certain items during the day.  My issue is as follows:  As mentioned you are known for you award winning BBQ.  As a patron, putting my name I on waiting list, I would like to be notified ahead of time if you are out of the most important food for which you are known for. I completely understand that there were other items on the menu, such as steaks and burgers, but as mentioned you are primarily a BBQ place, now if at a certain time of the day, you turn into a steak house or a burger place, that knowledge would be highly appreciated. Either way, it seems a little off, if you know that you run out of the most popular items early, yet you are open till midnight and don't let your patrons know what's available until they actually sit down and then are told, that is not appreciated.	3star
The seafood was fresh, and service was quick but cold. Our server was an older gentleman and he was't exactly friendly. He came by to take our order almost immediately after we sat down. By the time the appetizers came, we were ready to order but I suppose he didn't hear me because he turned around and walked away; my friend had to flag him down for us to order again. Anyhow, we had: - West Coast Oysters  - Shrimp Cocktail  - New England Clam Chowder - GET THE BOWL ($1o.oo)! With only a $2.oo difference, you get so much more and it's great for sharing. The New England Clam Chowder, however, was so watery. My friend said it was better the first time he had it so I suppose it's a hit or miss.  - Grilled Calamari  - Lobster Mac and Cheese ($19.5o) - For a starter, the portion was pretty big and you can definitely share with 3-4 people but I wouldn't recommend this. There was a good amount of lobster but the Mac and Cheese was watery and tasteless.  - Lobster Roll ($21.oo) - You get a good amount of meat in the sandwich, but the bun needs some work. It was so thick and soft, I peeled off almost half the bun. The lobster roll was not bad but you can definitely get better ones elsewhere.  - Surf N' Turf ($46.oo) - The steak was so tender but it was charred thus bitter, and the lobster tails were overcooked. It was a pity because it would've tasted so good, especially with that melted butter.  In all, the food was good but they really need to clean their grills. Whatever grilled food we had was charred, which was saddening because otherwise it would've tasted really good. The grilled calamari, for example, was very tender and tasty but again your palate would have to first go through a piece of their grills -- gross!.  I would go back again but hopefully I won't have to taste the grills next time.	3star
Usually we love this neighborhood friendly place...but tonight it was everything but. It was a Friday night...they told husband and I it was a 45 minute wait...no big deal, it's a gorgeous night we will hang outside. After 50 minutes and an estimated 15 parties sat before us we asked how much longer. The rude young man taking names told me that it would be another 45 minutes and it would of been smarter to call ahead. Not only was I caught off guard that the wait is now double our original time, he scolded me! It was now 10pm, we are starving and its too late wait another 45 minutes somewhere else or anywhere else for that matter! We left. Rude staff tonight and very unhappy with the organization of a place we used to love to frequent.	1star
An old favorite. Good, hearty food, excellent sangria, lively ambience. Somewhat cramped depending on where you are seated.	4star
The Alcove is amazing!!! The vibe, ambiance, food, drinks are all on point at this establishment. This place is a great time for lunch, a night out with the ladies, and even a date. The staff is super friendly, always making sure you are having a great time and checking up on you. For drinks, my friend ordered a tamarind mojito and loves it. She has been there before and recommended the place. I just ordered a club soda and lime, but their beer and drinks offerings are extensive. The food is amazing. I for one am going healthy, so I chose one of the 3 salads, the cous cous salad and I added grilled chicken to my order. Omg was this salad deliciously amazing. It is the best salad I have ever had. The salad with the cous cous was so flavorful and the roasted corn added a nice sweetness to the salad. Now the grilled chicken was cooked perfectly, juicy and well seasoned. Delish I tell you. As for my friend, she ordered the tacos, pork, beef and chicken. She raved about them and couldn't resist to get it again. I tried some of the beef and it was well seasoned and cooked well. It was all she raved about and more. My best friend didn't want to stop there, so she asked that we share the shirt steak lollipops. I obliged and man oh man were they great. A lil too salty for my liking, but so tender marinated well and served on a bed of mesculum. Overall amazing amazing. I am definitely going back soon. 5 stars indeed!!!	5star
Overall, this place is over-hyped and underwhelming.  Above average Japanese fusion but nothing special in my opinion.  There are many better options at this price point.	3star
What I like about this restaurant is that it has a limited menu and everything on that limited menu is made to perfection. You go to most restaurants now and the menu is so extensive that you've gotta wonder if the chef is good at making everything on the menu taste exactly how you want it. At any rate, his restaurant is small, maybe 10 tables, maybe not and it makes you feel like home. The bar seems a little large for the space, but who cares. Their adult drinks are delicious and you won't even notice. Eat here. You won't be disappointed. Oh, I almost forgot: I had the short rib sandwich, sweet potato fries and a side of Mac. Delicious. Someone else had the fried chicken, another had the shrimp and another had a burger, all with zero complaints. Yeah, eat here.	5star
Needed to find a good brunch spot in Cobble Hill and Uglyducking was it. I went out with a dear friend and she selected the place because they serve Eggs Benedict, which is a favorite for hers, my only requirement is alcohol.  The location it's self was medium sized, not too big and not too cramped either, the service was quick, our orders came out in a few minutes. I had chicken and waffles and was not disappointed.  The chicken was boneless and seasoned well. The waffle were a little sad but they did the trick. Over all it was a good experience, I would definitely go again.	4star
"Came here with a bunch of friends. First time there and I give it 5 stars due to excellent service and the delicious food!!!I can't express how amazing the fried rice is! Salivating, Chinese sausage with crispy fried rice that will make you want some MORE! I also had a side of fresh Lobster (this is all at the bar btw) with melted butter.  Other than the food- this place is chill, friendly environment. Like ""Cheers"" - ""..Where everybody knows your name!"" Enjoy!"	5star
Ok I just left this place. Came in at 215 &sat at the bar for brunch.There were 4 of us. We took about 5 minutes to decide what we wanted to order. We each ordered a entree and an order of deviled eggs to start. I had a mimosa & it was delicious. My boyfriend had the ugly mary & it was the best bloody mary we both have ever had. Here is the problem. This place has been open for some time now & should know how to handle a full house on a Sunday for brunch. Your bar is in Carrol Gardens !!!! You will have people coming in constantly!!! We waited 1 hour for our food!!! Sat at 2:15 and didnt get our food untill 3:25!! Parties of 2 that arrived after us got their food before us. I'm sorry but an hour wait for brunch food ? Yes the food was delicious & Yes the bartender kept the drinks flowing, but That is just too long to wait for some chicken and waffles. Anddddd our appetizer came at the same time as our food. I dont understand why simple deviled eggs could not come out before our food since we did ask for it as a starter... Those that were seated at tables got their food much quicker than we did and I dont know if it is because we were sitting at the bar or If the kitchen was short staffed but for me personally, there is no excuse. For the horrible wait , I have to take a star away.	3star
I had chilli ramen and it was great!! service was fast and attentive.Will definately come back here again to try something else.	5star
Service: 5, decor: 4, food: 4 = overall: 4.5 WOWZAH. Went here for lunch on a Monday - it was pretty packed to the brim. They have all the window/doors open so that the outer tables sit on the brink of the restaurant, short of spilling out onto the curb. I actually don't like sitting curbside, but this place makes sure it's fully shaded, and the spring breeze was fantastical (sure, if I was in a summer dress, I'd be sprawled on the curb, no problem). They have 3 other locations (East Village, NoMad, and Lincoln Square).  Their food is delectable. NomNomNomNomNooOOom. I have to stop myself from coming here again bc I know what's good, but what's good is bad for me. My usual self would've opted for the raw bar for appetizers, but I felt like eating cooked food for once - maybe it's also because I can actually SEE Crave Fishbar across the street, the spot exactly for raw bar cravings. For appetizers, we ordered:  (1) hot potato chips with blue cheese fondue - HOT DAYUM. My eyes were rolling deep into the back of my head as I took the first bite. There's no foodadox going on here - everything looks just as good as it tastes.  (2) crab cake tots - this was meh. It looked cute but, remember those good ol' days when you could stuff yourself with McD's filet o fish? Yeah.. it tastes JUST like that. It's great - for a dollar. Get your crab cake tot cravings at McDs then. Same stuff, different price.  (3) spicy chicken lollis - these were alright, too. The chipotle spice gave a little kick to it. It was presented beautifully but it was a bit hard to cut through. The lime gave it a refreshing twist - a pleasantly surprising combo of ingredients that made this one pop.  I definitely want to try all the other apps next time, especially the tuna poke. They have a full bar, so I might even drop by for a small dish and a drink next time.  As for my main course, I heard the salads were enormous here - I love me some salad after eating all that dirty good grub for appetizers. I ordered the seared tuna salad. The tuna was cooked well, and the chunks of salt dispersed evenly across the 4 pieces of tuna was a graceful touch. The salad was fresh but it wasn't as enormous as I thought it'd be (but then again, I didn't finish it).  Everyone seemed to have enjoyed their dish. I hear the grilled shrimp is finger lickin' good - that'll be my next dish ;)  Service was also good - the waitress checked up on us at least 3 times. Our waters were refilled without our asking and before they were empty. They also give you complimentary water AND sparkling water - not an easy find. The place is casual with a trendy twist that makes it perfect for business luncheons/dinners or casual dates.	5star
"Food was fine but the service was bad.  We were 4 people, two of us ordered pork and lamb both were way too salty so we sent them back and I told the manager I was very disappointed with my pork, he replied: ""it's tasted fine for me and I'm not going to argue with you."" Then just walked away.  I would NEVER go back there again!"	2star
So I finally made my way out here to this legendary ramen restaurant. A favorite among my fellow Yelpers, Momosan is famous for including a slice of seaweed with the actual logo of the restaurant printed on it with every bowl of ramen ordered.  I came in a few nights ago and the place was jam packed. Located just two blocks away from Grand Central station, Momosan gets tons and tons of traffic. Luckily, I was able to steal a seat from the communal dining table. I ordered right away. I had the Tonkotsu Ramen with an added extra egg. The pork bone soup here is just beyond amazing!! So silky, smooth and creamy. The noodles cooked just slightly passed al dente, and the egg nicely soft boiled. The only complaint I have is the pork slices they included were like 70% fat to lean meat. I scooped out the pork slices and left them on my extra side plate LOL.	4star
There comes a time in every man's life when they are propelled and compelled, despite their own best judgement and despite the ol' teacher called experience, to absolutely gorge themselves to bloatation. On the 4th of July, 2017 (sweet Lord, bless America and my over-exerted stomach) that day came for me.  The sights, the smells, the MEATS! It's like BBQ Valhalla in here, man. My Wife and I came in with our best friends on Independence Day and we just went to town. We ordered it all dude, I think our bill was over $200. We saw the menu and went crazy. We couldn't choose so we just chose it all. The Brisket and the Pulled Pork were off the hook. That stuff was amazing. The sausage was great too. Cornbread was delicious and absolutely worth the premium they're hitting you for it. To be honest, we found the Beef Rib to be pretty lackluster. It was too fatty and not very flavorful. We didn't finish it and wished we had gotten more of the others. That said, we got a half pound of brisket, pulled pork, beef rib, lamb belly, a sausage, 4 pieces of cornbread, an order of baked beans, and an order of cole slaw. After the drinks, let's just say they had to roll us out of there and it was way too much food. You definitely won't have to worry about leaving this place hungry, my friends.  The setting is two large rooms, well lit, with individual tables and long cafeteria-style tables. There's no wait service, you just order at the counter and seat yourself (first come, first served). The staff at the counters were very friendly and helpful. All of the sauces and whatnot are on the tables or up near the counter, and there is a separate full bar inside the first room for sitting and/or ordering your drinks. Now, partially due to the acclaim and popularity of this place, partially due to the counter-order style, the wait time here is usually pretty hefty. The cool part is, though, you can order drinks at the bar and drink the line away. We were here on a holiday which vastly exacerbated the wait time (it was over an hour from the end of the line to the counter) but it was still not too bad with drinks and friends to accompany. If you're coming in at a peak hour or with a big group, try to get in earlier to make sure you snag a table. Also, be advised that parking around here can be pretty tough so factor that in as well. Either way, we had a great time and we would definitely be back. Thanks Hometown BBQ!	4star
Wow what an experience. Worth the wait. We had the margarita pizza and the #6. Davids service was amazing. Thank you for all the great advice your genuine help. Loved this place. Oh by the way have to have the ice cream.	5star
I only give this place a one star is because their food is good. Other than that, their service suck ass. They continuously talking on the other side; I have to hunt them down to take my order. The old lady was rude, I didn't tip because I feel as if they do not deserve it, but that woman actually run after me and demand it. I will not return even if their food is good.	1star
I'm a newly minted member of the Brunch Club. I've tried a handful of brunch places around the West 4 area with close friends and this one takes the cake.  The atmosphere is extremely pleasant, with accented wood furniture creating a welcoming vibe. Filling out the resturant is a nice bar supplemented with plenty of natural light courtesy of glass windows at the front. And with outdoor seating as summer rolls around! The only thing I had a hard time finding was the bathroom but with a few turns I was successful.  Now onto the service and food. Seating was extremely quick even at 12:30 for our party of six. Our waitress was efficient in taking our orders and offering us insights into the menu. I ordered the much touted Eggs Benedict with bacon and fries on the side (you can opt for Smoked Salmon instead of bacon and a salad as your side). Nevertheless my order lived up to the hype. The poached eggs were perfectly cooked with a warm center yolk that soaked up the English Muffin. The bacons complimented the eggs and muffin nicely. I was pleasantly surprised this filled my appetite, a rarity for brunch places.  Bottom Line: I can confidently say I have a new found love for brunch and Extra Virgin sits at the very top of my list...at least for now.	4star
My boyfriend and I had been bar hopping around Williamsburg for hours and were starving. We didn't have a reservation, but Traif was able to seat us at the bar (typically my preference). The tasting menu is a great deal, so we went with that. Most of the dishes were stellar (scallops, foie gras, pork belly, sweetbreads, tuna tartar on crispy eggplant) but some were kind of a miss (buffalo frog legs, strawberry ribs).  Over all, a good meal and service was on point even though it was a packed house.	4star
After a long day of touring the financial district and WTC memorial this was a nice short walk. Staff was super friendly and attentive and everything was reasonably priced.. Kids had the burger and were very happy and adults had French onion soup- good and hanger steak special- different from regular hanger in that it had a red wine reduction- delicious ! Had the buffalo and blue cheese potatoes as well and if you like a little heat they were very good. I wish there were half stars as I would have done 4.5 so I ro	5star
More like Boring Place. After a friend of mine did some food photography here, I finally decided to check it out. Since moving to New York from Chicago, my taste buds have been exposed to just about everything edible, and with that comes the burden of knowledge and experience. Loring Place isn't a bad restaurant, it's just not that great. Comparatively speaking, it's probably not worth trying. Short story, the savory dishes are underwhelming. The flavors fall flat, and are sometimes dissonant.  If you order the cheeseburger you will know what I mean firsthand. Please don't order the cheeseburger.  Despite the letdowns, I will say the dessert is absolutely spectacular.  If you must go, go for dessert. If you're in the village, there are a dozen restaurants that easily eclipse this place. Do your homework and you'll be fine.	2star
This review is based on the food although the service was ok. I've heard so much about this place and decided to try it after being to travesias and finding out they don't open till 4pm and I was sooo hungry. It was a Saturday and they had a brunch option with unlimited mimosa or sangria for $8 which I thought was reasonable so I ordered the steak and eggs and it came it rice, and plantains included. My friend had the lumpy crab with hollandaise sauce and I thought hers was very tasty. However, both meals came out cold, flat out cold including the garlic fries. We almost sent it back but we feared they might spit in it or think we're being difficult. I might come back maybe for the unlimited sangria or mimosas thou.	2star
Really fast service here and hands down probably the best tacos in New York City which I was expecting that. I had them once before in the Chelsea market. This shop is a lot more organized then the other location. I had 2 quesadillas carne asda and the pollo and a side of chips and salsa. All amazing.	5star
Quick sandwich run before heading out to the airport. You get a ticket when you walk in and you need to give the ticket back on your way out - sah-curity! I had no idea sandwiches were $20+ but you get alooooooot of meat with your sandwich. We split s pastrami sandwich. It was very gooood but could have used a smidge of salt.	3star
Came here on a weekday.  Was about a 30 min wait, they do not take reservations. It is really loud in there we had a hard time talking to each other. We got the kakuni bun. It was alright, the pork belly was a little chewy. We also order the niku toufu. Portion was small and the beef was really salty. We each order a tonkatsu ramen. It came with 2 really thin piece of pork. The soup was also really salty. I had better ramen in NYC. Would not be returning.	3star
This review is purely for the food. The service was good, as they tried their best to accommodate everyone during Thursday night dinner. I had a comedy club show to catch with my boyfriend around the corner, and I was surprised I was in and out of the place in time. We both ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen and the fried tofu with eggplant appetizer. The food came out quick, but that led to me thinking why that impacted the food's taste. The fried tofu was served in a bowl of soy sauce with fried eggplants on top. I thought the tofu looked odd, and my boyfriend pointed that out as well. I thought the tofu was underfried, and we gave it a chance. I was highly upset as this tofu's exterior texture was just a sticky, jelly-like cornstarch. It was as if the tofu wasn't fried at all. The ramen was disappointing as well, as the broth had an odd milky consistency with a peanut or sesame-type taste. The noodles were al dente. The only reason I came in was to catch a meal before the show after I had snacked on a matcha cream puff at Bubble & Sip. I was glad I had something enjoyable. I would not eat here again.	1star
Worse customer service ever. The manager doesn't care anything about people's needs. Food is average (not good not bad), but waiting time is a pain, it just doesn't worth it.  If you are looking for a place to have a good day, avoid coming here.	1star
I've only tried the uni bibimbap here so that's the sole basis of this review. I went with 2 friends and we're all ridiculously basic so we ordered the exact same dish. That being said... YUM. I never particularly liked uni until I tried it here and the seaweed puree goes so well with it. There's also this wheel you spin upon being seated where you can win complimentary appetizers, drinks, and whatnot. We didn't actually get anything, but our server gave us fries anyway! However, it's a more Asian/Korean fusion restaurant (the uni bibimbap bore little resemblance to actual bibimbap) and I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for authentic Korean food.	4star
"Came here to celebrate Valentine's Day early and BOY was I disappointed.. We arrived around 7:50pm and was told there's a 10-15 minute wait, which wasn't bad. After we got seated we placed our orders, Maguro Tartar ($16), Miyazaki Beef Ishiyaki ($38), Sea Urchin Unisoba ($22) and the Salmon Chirashi ($26). The Miyazaki Beef Ishiyaki came out first and you cook the beef on top of a hot stone which was unique. It came with a side of salt, soy sauce and wasabi. The beef was so juicy and tender. The salt complimented the beef so well. Shortly after came the Maguro Tartar. The Tartar was bland and average, I've had better. Half way into our appetizers the waitress came and told us they were sold out of ALL the soba dishes and we had such a hard time picking another dish. So we ended up going with the Hot ""inaniwa"" udon ($13.50). After we finished both appetizers, we waited about 45 minutes and had to ask our waitress to check on our remaining 2 dishes. Finally the Hot ""inaniwa"" udon came out and can i just say WHAT THE HELL.. it was just a small basic, plain noodle soup.. For $13.50 !! definitely not worth it at ALL ! 15 minutes after receiving the Hot ""inaniwa"" udon the waitress comes back and told us that there was some ""technical difficulties"" with our second dish, the Salmon Chirashi and that she does not know how long it will take. By then it was almost 10pm, we were still hungry and tired of the waiting, we just wanted to get the bill and leave.. So we had a total of 3 dishes and out of the 3 dishes, we only liked 1 (Miyazaki Beef ishiyaki). I won't be returning to Sakagura."	2star
This was a laid back place must say it gets pretty crowded and most of the tables are outside. They do have like 2 or 3 tables inside where you order. It was decorated with a lot of murals which made it very interesting and gave it a cool feel. They also had a mini clothing line if you ever decide to buy a shirt, hoodie or a hat that has their restaurant name this is the place. the chairs are not comfortable (basic metal fold able chairs) and some of the table were also just those plastic fold tables. They had dogs in there as well as children. I was a little thrown off when i saw babies there as there parents drank away guess it is a place for all? I did see a children section but thought it was for specific days for children to come with their parents.In my opinion this place is overpriced for what it offers but it is worth a one time visit and maybe a second. The mojitos were not traditional mojitos but they were not terrible either. Food was ok i had a chicken quesadilla and it was average definitely had better one before.	3star
Be careful they add tip on the bill even for three ppl.  We didn't notice and added tip separately.	2star
I came here before a comedy show, as per usual I gad the pad kee mow, not the best, lacked, the char flavor that I love.	3star
This is definitely a fun place to come on a date or girls night out! The only minus here is that they make you share tables with others, if you are a party of 2. I would've preferred to have my own table and privacy. Food was delicious and a fun experience !	4star
I walked in here tonight because I was so hungry and craved Italian food but the hostess lied to me that the wait was 1+ while the bar was open because I was by myself.she profiled me which I could tell but anyways I am Glad I didn't eat here !	1star
Thai spice hotline. I have not been to this place in 15 years. It is certainly a lot fancier then I remember. I came here last night for date night with the wife. We had three healthy sized apps, the green papaya salad. It was just as it should be. A  hot / cooling sensation running thru my mouth full speed. First dark lao down and wife's lychee martini. Then came the fried watercress salad. I was apprehensive on ordering this one knowing my wifes love for fried anything, not! This dish was devilishly good. The larb was larb a awesome dish of heat,meat and lime. Third lao and second lychee down. Wife returns to the watercress to keep the heat at bay. Now I did ask for thai hot and it was. I wish I sat with a party of 50 so I could have tasted everything. I guess I will have to just go back. Worth the trip Manhattanites Eat, drink enjoy	4star
Finally come to Wok Wok after hearing good reviews. The restaurant had a good amount of people so I was excited. I ordered the Pad Thai, a dish I have regularly at Thai restaurants. I wasn't meaning to order it here but they didn't have the lemongrass chicken I wanted, even though it was on the menu.  We also ordered Roti which was really good. Our main dishes took super long to come out, tables who came in after us were getting their dishes.  The Pad Thai was okay. I usually swallow down the whole dish in like five minutes but I had leftovers and I wasn't satisfied. The noodles were very mushy and it just didn't taste authentic.  The prices were pretty cheap!  Would come back to try other items, though!	3star
Fun shopping trip in NYC. Ordered shrimp scampi pizza for 25. It needed garlic, salt and most of all it needed flavor... waiter disappeared after we declined his sparkling water up sell and never came back for anything. He even forgot to bring our drinks. Runners brought food and parmesan cheese. When we asked for garlic the pic is how they brought it out?  Whole cloves... will not be back. Went to shake shack for dessert!!!	1star
Been here 3 times now! Quick tips: -Stick with the soup dumplings. Solid value for food considering quality and location.  -most of the fried items are skippable and not that special -noodle soups are decent, the beef one has nice chunks of meat with tender tendon (obvs watch out if that's not your thing) -pumpkin cakes with coconut are surprisingly well done; lightly sweetened, tender and chewy. Not stretchy like mochi though Overall: For about $10 you can have a nice lunch. I'll probably be back and will keep updating regarding various menu items. FOOD:  -Drunken Chicken: very tender and juicy but the poaching liquid was too salty so any drunken and chicken-y flavors were largely drowned out. Good potential though, could have just been a subpar batch.  -Soup dumplings: The XLB were great! Soup was nicely sweet and porky, with definite hints of dried shiitake and white pepper I think. The skin was a fair thickness and the gingered-vinegar dipping sauce was a welcome condiment.  -Chicken sauerkraut spring rolls: well fried but very little filling. Flavor was good, but again, very little inside. Not worth the price. -Pan Fried Pork Bao: a little on the oily side, dough was very well risen. Pretty big overall though. Still would say the XLB are more satisfying, even if not as filling. [4.5/5] SERVICE: Fairly quick; there was about 5 orders in front of me and I still got my food within 10 minutes. The people taking orders were polite and repeated my order back to me to make sure everything was correct. [5/5] ROOM: Nice looking place, very trendy and woody. A decent amount of seating, I'd guess the room could probably fit 30-40ish diners at max. Lighting is a bit sparse and there's a bit of a bottleneck next to the condiments and trash. Beware hitting your legs on the table legs- hurts a ton, trust me. [4/5] VALUE: Decent value. It takes real craftsmanship to make XLB and Yaso did not disappoint. I've been to the king of XLB, Din Tai Fung, and while DTF's XLB are arguably better, Yaso's are satisfying. Other menu items aren't as good as a value. [4/5]	4star
Feels like the food at this branch is not consistent in terms of quality. the other day we came here to order out. both of our noodles the pork soup noodle and the spicy beef dry noodles were both super oily and spicy. ive had these many times and in the past they were good. this time we did not like it.   also i would love to see that someday xi an improve their packing containers. it's nearly impossible to bring home a bowl of soup noodles without it spilling...	3star
"S is for Slow. L is for Low speed. O is for ""Oh, our food is finally here"" W is for ""Well, it's pretty tasty, but honestly?! $13 for 4 chunks of 'grilled' watermelon that, I'm almost sure, had seen no heat? WTF! ...sauce was delicious, though."" What does that spell?"	3star
This restaurant is for tourists only.  It is not for people who seriously like sushi.  I got the toro tartare.  I don't even know how to describe it.  The tuna was completely mushy and was served with a small flat spoon so that you could scrape it of its serving dish.  What is the point of a fancy presentation if the fish tastes awful? I got the shrimp tempura which was not crunchy and covered in a sweet sauce that have the texture of a thin mayonnaise.  I took one bite then left the rest. I got one roll.  It was very bland. The only good thing I had was one piece of belly tuna.  Very tender. If you want a very sleek looking restaurant and don't care about the food, then this is for you.	1star
As far as food goes, you're better off at Jeepney or Pig & Khao. We went there on a Friday night and it was pretty slow. We sat the bar and ordered drinks which were good. I had the Calamansi whiskey sour. The food wasn't so good. We ordered the lumpia shanghai, it's pretty hard to mess up lumpia but they managed to totally screw it up. The meat was mushy and seemed undercooked. Then we ordered the sisig which was too greasy and wasn't crisp on the bottom. Then we asked for a side of rice and it took 10-15 mins to get to and our food form had gotten cold. The menu items sounded like there was a mix of fusion and typical Filipino fare but based on our experience I probably wouldn't come back to try any of it. I think this place gets it's ratings bc they are one of the few that do kamayan which is pretty unique in NYC.  However I looked at the Kamayan menu and it sucks. As far as the ambiance goes, Ugly Kitchen has no distinct identity or character. You wouldn't even know it's Asian fusion or what sort of customer they want to attract. Worst part was music, it was HORRIBLE. Seriously get a new DJ. They started playing Micherona... why, just why..? You could tell a group/party was coming in bc there was a girl bouncing around as if this was her jam she requested and another guy came up to the bar and got a drink immediately. We didn't even get asked if we wanted a 2nd round. Horrible service. They were catering too much to them and began to neglect us. If that was the case, then they should have reserved the space for evening and closed it for a private event. It was only 10pm, we closed our tab and we left thinking wtf?	1star
A long walk to the west village AND a wait when we get there of approximately 30 minutes. Ehhhh No thanks. Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't bad, I just don't think i'd trek all the way back for the food. The prices were decent. We ordered a carafe of wine, and it never showed up. They billed us, but when we pointed it out , they corrected the order. The spaghetti was basic, but cooked well. The sauce was yummy and the basil really brought it to the next level. The tagliatelle with meat ragu was yummy too, but my 2nd fave. I preferred the spaghetti, but this wasn't bad. It was just a bit rich. We shared an order of meatballs. My least fave dish of the night. It was ehhh forgettable, and it didn't taste that fresh. The sauce tasted a bit different than the sauce that was served with the Spaghetti.  Overall, the food was mediocre. I'd just rather trek to a closer location such as Da Andrea and order slightly better quality food at similar prices.	2star
Went with a group of 7 people for an early Sunday night dinner, and was pretty impressed.  From the solid (homemeade) pasta dishes to the interesting and delicious cocktails to the perfect light jazz background music, we had a great evening!   Some highlights include:  -For cocktails, try the Aperol Spritz. Nice, light and refreshing -For appetizers, try the Frito Misto.  Also the salumi & cheese platter for 2 (which is sizeable!).  -For entrees, try the Garganelli. Delicious! The Carbonara and Fusilli were also really good. The only possible negative about this place is that it's not a bustling busy restaurant (particularly on a Sunday night).  But we didn't feel alone, it was actually kind of nice to have the place largely to ourselves.  Highly recommend.	4star
"I came on a Friday evening and it was so busy/ packed, I asked the hostess how long was the wait? The hostess said 1-2hr wait and as soon as I asked my friend if he was willing to wait the hostess said "" BYE."" So I was annoyed and wasnt going to come back, I tried again on a Tuesday night(yesterday) and the hostess then was very friendly so they redeemed themselves. I love the ambiance and the outside seating that retractable opening walls.  My waiter gave us superb customer service (I wish I knew his name to give him a shout out) he knew the menu well and gave us his best suggestion. we had the guca and chip, which was average, It would be helpful if they could ask customers how spicy they would like their guac as they do in other places that have awesome guac. i ordered a mango margarita which was soooooo good! i ordered the tuna tostada which I really enjoyed (recommendation of the waiter, Thanks!) and my bf had the gordita chicharron, he stated that it was interesting wasnt really impressed ( he is a hard person to satisfy anyway). we ordered the churro for dessert which was tasty  So after all that good review as  the night went on and sipping on my watermelon drink, I looked down and guess what i saw crawling by my foot???????? A FREAKING WATER BUG AKA BIG ASS ROACH!!!! YUCK I was displeased after that. I wasnt sure if i came from outside since we sat next to the retractable door/wall. I was going to mention it to the waiter but that roach ran/walk/crawl so fast I didnt even know where it went. I really want to give this place a good/average review but the bug put a bad taste in my mouth!!"	1star
Its always the small spots with the best food. this was just my lucky day. My boo and I was extremely hungry and it was up to me to pick a place. I found this place on yelp and saw the reviews and decided to go with it. The waiters were nice and the food was amazing !!!! I order the  Peach Granola Toast French and Collard Greens . It was the best collard greens I ever tasted.  There is nothing like going to a restaurant super hungry and leave super happy. The only thing that stopped it from getting 5 Stars is that I was sitting my door and the cold air was coming in hitting me. Other than that, it was great! xoxo Cynthia	4star
It's not the best but it's not the worst. I love stopping by for lunch because I can grab a lunch box + salad for under $9. The line gets really long during lunch and it looks intimidating but it really moves by quick!  Be sure to get their rewards card. I've racked up about eight cards so far and tonight I got another one! Haha  I stop by after work for dinner and some drinks often. This spot is the go-to for pregaming, FYI. My favorite dish is the garlic chicken which comes out to be $7.00 pre-tax.	3star
"Meh. Pretty thoroughly underwhelming experience. The Momofuku has become such a staple ""brand"" name in the Asian Fusion New York community, that I was excited to give one of David Chang's places a try. A friend and I came on a Friday night at 8:30pm and had about an hour long wait before we got in. Seating is definitely on the cramped side, but so is everything in New York I guess. Service here is pretty spectacular, that's definitely something I want to call out. We had to wait a bit longer than the expected 45 minute wait time, and the waitstaff was fantastic about it -- they apologized about the wait, offered us free drinks, etc. That's pretty spectacular service and just a really nice gesture from their part that makes the experience holistically better.  Unfortunately, the rest of the food was pretty meh. We got four dishes: Arctic char -- good cut of fish, but fish + creme fraiche and chives really can't be  underwhelming -- also not sure how this was really Asian fusion, I've had a similar dish at Grameracy Tavern Steamed buns -- this is what everyone raves about.... the pork belly is pretty spectacular, but yo, it's a steamed bun. Not sure it's any more unique than what you could get at Ippudo or even Baohaus down the street. Sure it's decent, but you're expecting more when you're paying these prices Dry aged sirloin tartare -- tartare was great, but the problem is that it was put on a buttermilk base which was just weird.... I mean, I applaud that it was an interesting idea to put tartare with something else -- I'm just not sold that that something else was supposed to be buttermilk Spicy pork sausage and rice cakes -- also raved about on the Yelp community .The rice cakes were pretty impressive -- perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Definitely on the spicier side of things. But the problem with this dish is that it's hard to want the rest of it. It's good enough to try and say oh yum, I liked that. But after you have a few bits, the flavor is really overwhelming and you're unlikely to want more.  Overall, the food wasn't bad, but it's definitely not as delicious as what you could get at other places if you're going to pay rough fine dining places. I'd rather just pay less and get an authentic Korean or Asian experience. Final price for these four dishes plus two drinks was $90. Which is what you would expect I guess... but the portions are definitely on the smaller side and we were still pretty hungry. tldr; pretty underwhelming, would not recommend. service is great though"	3star
I stopped by on a weeknight during prime dinner time and was lucky to snag the last two available spots, which were bar-style facing the wall. This is one of the most popular Thai restaurants so I expected to wait to be seated. The atmosphere is tiny and packed, but loud and bustling, just what I imagined a busy city in Thailand would be like. I ordered the Wok Basil with Chicken, but was disappointed that they were unable to substitute the bowl of rice for extra vegetables. I was avoiding carbs at the time, so the dish was flavorful but quite spicy without rice. -1 star for them not accommodating someone with dietary restrictions. Now that I am eating carbs, I'd love to come back and try their noodle dishes!	4star
Y'all. Y'ALL. SugarFreak has long been an Astoria institution, but this was my first time at the new location, and I'm honestly blown away.  The new menu is bigger, but somehow more focused. The addition of the seafood boils are so right you'll wonder why they weren't on the menu before. We got a combo boil with snow crab legs and crawfish, and it was so fun - they put brown paper on the table, gave you bibs, and put the food in a bag right on the table.  Michelle and team are killing it. Again.	5star
It was warm inside...which paired with beer and bacon isn't a good combo. This was our last stop of the night so we just ordered the beer and bacon flight, which seems to be a popular choice. We went with having the recommended beer pairings, which had been explained to us to compliment the bacon. The four types of bacon came out in pairs--flavors of jalapeno, corn cob, maple and pecan. Jalapeno kind of tasted like a jalapeno flavored powder was rubbed all over it, while the corn cob was basically undetectable. Our favorite was the maple, sweet and salty. Basically couldn't tell it wasn't pecan, but still tasted better than the corn cob somehow. The beers that they paired with the bacon didn't really seem to compliment them...the dark coffee beer was paired with the jalapeno and an IPA paired with the maple was all I can remember. Go if you're super into bacon and beer, but otherwise I would pass.	3star
There was hair in my food. :( The food didn't meet my expectations. It was good, but not amazing. I saw the hair as soon as I got the food so they kindly apologized and made me a new meal.  The atmosphere is amazing, though. The interior really makes you feel as if you're somewhere in Japan. Cool little hidden spot.	3star
Came on a Saturday for brunch. Not very busy at 12. We were seated in the back right by the speakers. As we were chatting it was very hard to listen to each other's conversations. The speaker was right above us and loud. I asked the staff of they could lower it just a little since the speaker was right above us. He said NO indicating that they had no control over the volume. Come on!! Really?! How could that be possible?! When the food came out our was small and bland. We ordered the fried fish burger. Fish was not marinated well. No taste at all. Quite bland in fact. Our friends ordered the salad and some fries for their daughter. Fries never came. Salad taste ok. Not impressed. Prob a one done.	2star
Absolutely loved the space and had great service. It's a very fun, casual environment. Love the communal tables. The drinks are pretty overpriced for such a low key area like Bushwick, so we went down the street for happy hour and came back.  The pizza is fantastic, not THE best I've ever had, but would definitely go back since it has great food and great ambiance. Definitely worth going to. It has A LOT of hype in the New York food scene, and I question if it deserves all of it, but it's still a totally great spot to hit up when in the area!!	4star
jerk is wimpy,  slaw needs more pickling,  more spice!!!!!, sandwiches should not be a la cart $12,  Bread is great,  where is the goat and oxtail?   drinks are  overpriced at $12 cocktails and redstripe at $7,  service needs to step up a bit. Nice good sized back patio.   Nice staff.  They should go for volume not margin...  for Caribbean I will go to deep brooklyn for more authentic and half the price... price per person  drink, food item, tax tip.   $25-50	2star
What a cool bar! I was visiting friends who live in the neighborhood, and they brought us to this spot after dinner nearby. The ambiance here really sold it for me, it has such an interesting vibe! Plus, there's a little stage at the back where I guess they have music sometimes. We were in on a Monday night before the 4th of July, so it was really quiet.  Their cocktail menu is extensive and unique, too! My friends love getting their cheese plates, though we were all too full of dinner to have any food.	5star
As many places in New York, this place was super congested with little to no seating area. Nothing to be surprised about, but not the first place that comes to mind when I want to go out with my friends. So during my one-week stay in New York, I visited this store about three time to try their well-renowned cremespresso. The first two times were a failure because their machines would stop working; the servers were so kind enough the first time to compensate by giving me a drink of my choice (since I'd already paid for the espressos), so they made me affogatos instead (more expensive than the original order) and added in a free pastry.  I also took some food back home with me and discovered probably the best chocolate I've tried in a long time: the Barratti & Milano brand white chocolate infused with champagne and blackcurrant. How amazing does that sound?  On my third visit there, I realized that the cremespresso tasted just like coffee-flavored ice cream. It was very thick, and tasteful and a small amount went a long way.  I didn't pay much attention to the other side of the restaurant with the pastas and the cooking recipes (because I didn't want to max out my credit cards yet), but it's a wonderful place to take your tourist friends and I'm so glad my friend introduced me to this place. It's also a great place to walk around and check out the other shops outside.	4star
"2nd stop on our pizza crawl this past weekend. Despite my entire crew commenting on how ""THIS IS THE BEST PIZZA I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE! PRAISE THE LORD! AHHHHH!"" I found this kind of to be underwhelming.  Type of style pizza - Very crunchy and crispy. You can hold a slice and have it stand still flat as a board without wiggling and moving. I'm not a particular huge fan of this style of pizza. But thin crust . . . . . real thin crust that's phenomenal - go to Chicago.  Type of pizza you definitely do need to order here because the sauce and the flavors on it despite being on a cracker wafer are amazing: Tie Dye. This unique pizza is covered in a vodka sauce with tomato, pesto dollops, and fresh mozzarella. The vodka sauce and pesto is such the perfect flavor combo. Just wish the crust was squishier like Neapolitan style.  Don't bother with the Classic pizza. Really did not enjoy the sauce on this at all. Actually the only slice of pizza I couldn't finish. It's their 50 year-old signature family recipe and its a shame that it left a lingering taste of throw up in my mouth. Atmosphere - Very cool and elegant. Old school. They have these antique fan lamps, an interesting vice like bread cutter. Everything looks old and elegant and mechanical. Kind of a steampunk early 1920's vibe.  Drinks are pretty expensive but they have an interesting selection. A few bottled beers I had never heard of before. $12 cocktails. One of my friends was a little bougie and ordered a martini with expensive vodka and it came out to $15. The staff was super accommodating for us as someone didn't realize when planning this pizza crawl that this location is right smack dab in the middle of San Genaro. The hostess only had a party of 8 people wait 2 minutes and managed to squeeze us up at the bar. I'd totally come back though to try another slice or maybe a pasta dish."	3star
"READ THIS REVIEW BEFORE YOU GO THERE!!.. Im going to cut to the chase. We ordered two pitchers of I believe it was the rosco rita. The first pitcher was fine (i hope) we get the second one my friend is pouring it out and I see something floating in my glass. I look closer and it's a fly, I'm in disbelief I tell my other friends to confirm what I see which they did it was in fact a fly. My friend who was pouring out the drinks looked into the pitcher and THERE WAS ANOTHER FREAKING FLY FLOATING IN THE DAMN PITCHER!!!! He brings the pitcher over to the manager who was behind the bar she then comes over and says sorry this has happened before we have fruit flies (they were bigger than fruit flies) and no matter how much we seal the tequila they still get in (I would love to know how that even possible) and we can't control that and I'll get you another pitcher a fresh one but you still have to pay for it. I then asked her to repeat herself because I had to make sure I was hearing correctly she then confirmed what I thought I heard and we told her no we do not want another pitcher and she took the ones we had and the glasses and walked away. I was seriously sitting there in disbelief until the server came over I explained to him what happened and how I worked in restaurants before which is a 100% accurate I've worked in high end hotels as well and there is no way we should be even told  we have to pay for another drink much less the whole Damn bill. He then goes back to the manager she comes back over and says she says still take off the food but we have to pay for the first pitcher. I said fine I was ready to go I was disgusted with the way the situation was being handled and the establishment. After hearing us talking the manager then comes back over and this is what took the cake for me. She goes what would you have wanted to happen what would have been a solution for you? I calmly explained to her for you to say we can get another pitcher but we have to pay for it just makes no sense. She then goes and I qoute ""IT'S NOT LIKE THERE WAS A BAND-AID IN THERE "". A freaking band aid she tried to justify two Damn bugs being in our drinks by saying atleast it wasn't a band aid. This place is absolutely disgusting whoever runs/owns that places needs to fire that manager she handled the situation extremely poorly I don't remember the managers name but she was a black woman with black hair cut into a Bob. You can spend your money here if you choose but I suggest you do it at your own risk. Flies in your drink is a no no and to be told atleast it isn't a band aid and you can have another but u still have to pay is just disgusting. I hope upper  management is reading this your establishment is extremely lucky I did not get a picture before my glass and those pitchers were taking away. I suggest you get whatever infestation you have under control and hire a manager that knows how to better handle a situation and is better trained in customer service because trust me she lacks it. Her attitude about the situation was disgusting, her trying to justify it was even more nauseating and you better hope you don't not have this happen to the wrong customer because your place won't be in business for long. I will never ever ever return here or suggest it to anyone I can only imagine how many customers swallowed a bug or two and didn't even notice. Patrons please take your money somewhere else it's not worth the risk Lord knows what's running around in the kitchen."	1star
Hands down one of the best restaurants we have experienced during our visit to NYC. We sat at the bar and ordered the Chef's Tasting Menu...Keshia our server was outstanding. She guided us to order this amazing course dinner and we were so grateful for her recommendation!! Traif nailed every course... The scallops, sliders, cinnamon glazed ribs, gnocchi, to-die-for desserts ... we are still blown away from our dinner experience. The Chef and his team are incredibly talented and the service from Keisha and her team was outstanding. We will never forget our perfect dinner at Traif. We wouldn't be surprised if we don't see their Chef on Top Chef or somewhere on the Food Network. It was that good!!!	5star
Hands down the best BBQ restaurant I've tried in NYC. The Turkey Pastrami Bacon Club may be the greatest sandwich I've ever had. Homemade and a home run all around, worth the trip out to Red Hook	5star
The crushed cucumber salad was good but a bit on the salty side. The shrimp buns were amazing!!! Definitely recommend them. However, the ramen itself wasn't the greatest. I got the duck ramen and the flavor wasn't really there. I asked the waiter what she recommended and she said the duck, but it was definitely a let down. My partner ordered the spicy miso which was my second choice and that was a bit better. I think they need to work more on the flavors. Might come back if I'm around the area but it's definitely not somewhere that I'd drive to again.	2star
Pretty average ramen -  come here only if you want a quick ramen fix while in the area.  Don't specifically travel for this - there are better ramen out there like Zundoya, Momosan, Ippudo and Bassanova -  of course, all of these pale in comparison to the average standard in Tokyo.  The Okinawa Shio and Tonkotsu Shio broths are pretty alright.	3star
Great outdoor space. Unfortunately, I had to remind the staff about half of the items in my order. My food was cold by the time I sat down. Then I noticed an item was still missing--didn't bother getting up and going through it again. I'd try it again, but maybe just to grab drinks?	2star
Very delicious . Expensive for just a small lobster sandwich but it's worth the splurge since they give a lot of lobster meat. It's very fresh and flavorful! About $15. But I think it's worth a try unless you live in Boston and have experienced better lobster rolls there then this place would be similar or probably not as comparable to its mother land.	4star
Traif's menu can seem overwhelming with all its diverse options for small plates. Party of 2?  Order 3-4 dishes. Party of 4? Order 5-6. You get the idea.  Truthfully, you can't go wrong with any of their dishes. Their vegetable dishes at the top of the menu list were the stars for us, surprisingly. Tons of flavor! The popular sliders dish was good, not great. Their prawns dish was HUGE. Our server was attentive, knowledgable, and friendly.  Only drawbacks are the subpar cocktails and rushed service.	4star
If I could give this place negative stars I would.  Terrible customer service.   I regret leaving a 10% tip, we should have just walked out and not paid.  The  restaurant is incredibly loud, my girlfriends and I were having a great evening, just had an amazing time at the Dolly Parton concert nearby. We had just arrived, barely received our food and the manager came over and told is we were being too loud and others were complaining.  I couldn't even hear him. My girlfriends had to explain to me what he said.  After that, our table was completely ignored.  We should have left with out paying the bill. They have no class with customer service.  Epic fail.  The food was mediocre.  I will never go back.	1star
"Destroyed 26th Anniversary Dinner. Have eaten approximately 40+ times in the past 15 years. Wonderful picture memories of my Father's 80th Birthday '14 before he passed away. Mother's retirement...Mother in Laws Birthday before she passed away '08 and too many birthdays to count (I have 8 children from 41 to 16). The one occasion that my beautiful wife wanted was to eat outdoors was 7/27/16 (perfect weather that nite). Attempted to make reservation was told ""NO"" they do not take them and that we will ""Definitely"" get outdoor seating. After waiting 10 minutes we were told no tables at all and should not be any at any time...? What a shame. Food is excellent though. But we won't return."	1star
For those that have known me for a long time, know that I have been trying to get to this place for about....6-7 years.  No, I am truly serious.  Yes, I know where Queens is.  Yes, I have multiple forms of transportation to get here.  I guess the first tip off I got was when we got parking literally right in front of the place.  You know when they say if it's too good to be true, it probably is?  Yeah - my feelings exactly. We walked in, and the place was a lot larger than I thought.  Lots of parties and big tables were arranged, and people from all walks of life were enjoying themselves.  We were quick to be seated, and they were quick to take our order. My husband got the Massaman curry and I got my staple of drunken noodles with shrimp.  The Massaman curry was so spicy, it was even too spicy for me, and I love spice!  He got the most lowest amount of spice one could ask for, and it was just too overpowering.  My drunken noodles were pretty basic - I wasn't wowed in any way, and no, this wasn't my favorite either.  The spices and the overall presentation fell really flat from my expectations.    From what Brooklyn has to offer, there was no need for me to leave my borough for here.  Sorry SriPraPhai - you might be a fan favorite, but I'm not getting on this band wagon.	3star
I came here based on a top 10 list for lobster rolls and I wished I skipped this place. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the smell. It smelled like I wandered into a fish market and it was fishy! I actually came early and waited outside for them to open and thought I would get the freshest seafood since they just opened. Boy was I wrong.  The lobster roll ($20) - this was DISGUSTING. The meat was dry and tasted like it was day old lobster meat that has been re-heated. I've had re-heated leftover lobster meat before at home so I know what it tastes like. It was seasoned to death with some spice (maybe old bay?) probably trying to mask that its not fresh lobster. DO NOT ORDER. The crab roll ($13) - this was better than the lobster roll for sure but still didn't taste fresh. Also, I feel only the top 2 pieces of meat are true crab meat. The rest looks and taste like fake crab meat. Probably why they shred it to little bits so you can't tell. TRY IT AND SEE FOR YOURSELF. Shrimp Tacos (MP) - My husband thought it was good but did say there was too much radish fillers.  Overall - I probably won't be going back. There are many many good seafood places all over brooklyn, from williamsburg to redhook.	2star
Really small place with a seating for probably no more than 20 people. Ordered lobster rolls, shrimp roll, crab claws and lobster bisque. Lobster roll was probably one of the best I have tasted. Didn't have too much mayo and a good amount of lobster. Portions were the same sized as most other lobster rolls I had. Shrimp roll wasn't very good. There weren't a lot of flavors and shrimps were small. Crab claws were small also. Lobster bisque was just what I needed on a cold day. It was hearty and had good amount of chunky pieces of lobster.	4star
Red Hook may have the best pseudo-chain lobster rolls in the city. Their options are great with both CT and ME style rolls and lots of other seafood on the menu. The rolls are pricey for sure but you get a ton of succulent lobster claw and tail meat. The pickup window is great for getting a roll fairly quickly, though it can still take a while to be made. It's kind of fun to see your lobster in the tank as well if you're into that. The roll is unique in flavor as it's fairly paprika and spice heavy which works nicely. You won't regret a roll from Red Hook.	4star
Okay, I feel really bad for giving a 1 star cause I usually have a minimum of 3 stars on all of my reviews on yelp.  To start off, the window and door to the restaurant was cracked. We came for the oysters deal on the weekend - $1 each with minimum order of 12. The oysters were so small and grimey. We didn't even finish half of it. If you do come here, I would recommend going for Asian menu (mama menu). Avoid all of the bar food, avoid the popcorn shrimp! The owner is friendly, he comes by and asks you how your meal is going.	1star
My overall impression of this place is that it's seriously overrated.  My friend and I shared the chicken liver and foie gras mousse for appetizer. The liver's unique flavor overpowered the foie gras and the texture was more like that of a paste than mousse, so it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. I got the steak frites for entree, and while it wasn't bad, it was nothing special either. For $41, I could've gotten a much nicer cut of steak elsewhere. I got to try my friend's duck confit as well and it was equally underwhelming.  In sum, the food is nothing spectacular but comes with a high price tag, the noise level is rather high and the ambiance isn't especially nice, and the wait time can get ridiculously long. I probably wouldn't return, except maybe for weekend brunch.	3star
3.5-4 stars. Gave it 4 instead of 3 stars because of super fast and efficient service and because it is a surprisingly good option for lunch-things that should be recognized! I ordered the Kuu Chili ramen-great choice! I requested medium spicy and the broth actually had just the right amount of kick and flavor. The noodles themselves were a little bit too firm (I didn't mind too much personally but could recognize that they weren't really the ideal texture) and there weren't too many other things in the bowl besides noodles, but the broth was enough to make the meal an enjoyable one. For FiDi, this place is definitely a good option. Don't go out of your way to hunt this place down though-there are plenty of much more amazing ramen joints in the city.  Really wish I could give 3.7 stars or something to be more accurate, but the 4 showing up on this review is to recognize the quick service, overall decency of the meal, the ability to pay with credit card, and the relative ease of finding a place to sit.	4star
"Food was ok. Not fitting the hype that justifies long weekend and prime dinner time waits. In my opinion this place gets a B on a alphabetical scale. I had the prego roll with fries, avocado and duck bacon. Basically steak sliced and put on bread. The fries were ok nothing you can't find in any decent cafe or restaurant. The duck bacon was ok too. I felt it was smoked too much so it took away from the natural flavors and all you tasted was mostly smoke.  It's a great addition though for us non pork eaters. I would love to see more restaurants add duck bacon to the menu as a alternative to pork. (Winning) Yeah! ""Jacks wife Freda"" was just ok. Nothing special. I didn't like the fact that they had a guy mopping the floor in the middle of the day when people are eating and the mop and water smelled like sewage and he was mopping literally under your table while you were eating, so you basically had the sewage smell with your meal too. I have to remind myself that the reason why these places are so popular is because most people don't cook anymore or even explore the wide pallet of spices and different herbs there are to make an amazing meal. Would I go back?: ummmmm NO! (Maybe) possibly NO.....actually I would rather go to Ed's Lobster bar right next door. That place is a winner .............Hipsters can have ""jacks wife"".  I know where the real hype is.  Happy eating foodies!."	3star
Called on the day and got a reservation for 6pm on a Saturday. 3 adults, 1 kid and 1 baby. The place was packed when we arrived. Friendly staff and lovely open kitchen. Baby was happy in her little booster seat and my daughter was given a tub of crayons and encouraged to draw right on the table (paper) - she had a blast! We ordered the Caesar salad (so fresh!), Asparagus (yum) and an assortment of pasta dishes (Uni, Pescatore, and Shiitake). The bread and Parmesan sticks were tasty and we had a great time. Would recommend this place for friends or families.	4star
Finally a Japanese establishment that sells something else other than ramen and sushi! I found my ootoya replacement! They have amazing apps and I still drool over that creamy baked salmon dish! It might be tooo creamy for some people but if you like alfredo it's a Must order!! They also have amazing sake flight totally worth the money as they were much much cheaper than had we ordered them separately. I ordered nanban don and my friend order oyakudon. Nanban was a little dry but I think the oyakudon is decent. They still can't compare to ootoya but is good enough. I like the vibe, the staff(super friendly) and the food!  Recommend to come in small or big group!	4star
"""GLASS EN LA COMIDA""  The food was bad. The place is nice. We had a piece of glass in our food and walked out. There's no love in this cooking or their wine selection. Just upscaled prices for what looks like would be a promising place. Had these sentiments prior to finding the piece of glass but that really left us speechless."	1star
"I don't think there's anything I can say about Ippudo that hasn't already been said (this is why I dislike reviewing places that already have a ton of good reviews - in this case 1,000+ 5* - because it seems pointless). But just wanted to leave a note here because their current special seasonal bao - the ""Gyutan Bun"" - is one of the better bao I've ever had, featuring fried beef tongue and an absolutely amazing wasabi mayonnaise. We liked it so much that we ordered another pair immediately upon finishing our first. Also, no wait on a weekday night at about 10pm - late on a weekday is probably a good time to go. It's hard for me to justify a wait for Ippudo (especially in NYC) since there is rarely a wait at Ippudo in other cities I travel to, but if there's no wait, I'm always game."	5star

The food was cold . The mac and cheese didn't taste good .

"Made a reservation for Tuesday night 8:30pm for 9 people. Requested to be seated under the sunroof area, was told they cannot guarantee that depending on how it is when we get there. I understand restaurants with high turnover rates usually don't guarantee you a table where you want it and 9 people is hard and risky to accommodate, especially if there is a cancelation, however, it was a Tuesday night at 8:30 and from a customer's point of view, isn't the point of making a reservation to ensure that a table is empty for your party to sit in before arriving there. My point is, while they did have a table for us, they were lazy about it. We got seated at the far end of the restaurant, somewhere where waiters are least likely to see you. They looked really understaffed and service was really slow. Granted, we were a big party of 9 but it took 1 hour from time of order, to time the pasta got to our table. During that one hour, we gnawed on very hard breadsticks ($2.50 if you want more) that tasted nice, but left all our jaws abnormally tired LOL. Our fried calamari appetizer lacked salt but came with a really good marinara sauce. We ordered more drinks - which were strong and good. But that still doesn't excuse the fact that 1 hour for pasta, even if its freshly made is unacceptable.  When our pasta finally arrived, I had lost my appetite.  The fetticini nero (squid ink pasta) with roasted garlic peccorino tasted like nothing and needed a lot more salt. It was way too thick and I tasted more heavy cream than garlic and peccorino. I asked for more cheese, it never came. The fetticini nero with carbonara had way too much heavy cream - it was creamy in a bad way. Authentic carbonara sauce should not have heavy cream. Based on the reviews on Yelp, we expected ""amazing"" carbonara and was left extremely disappointed. It also needed more salt. The tagitelli with crushed meatballs had very tasty meatballs but the pasta itself tasted raw and doughy. Im 99.9% sure that the pasta was undercooked. It was also too soft, and I felt like I was eating clumps of raw dough.  The rigatoni with sunday sauce was ok. The sauce was mediocre but the pasta, again tasted raw and doughy. To summarize, the non-tomato based pasta lacked salt and the tomato-based pastas were raw.  In the end, they got our bill wrong and in response, told us to ""calm down."" The reviews made me excited to try this place, especially with all the pasta pairings and options. I only saw 2 waiters busting their ass for 60 seats all night. I know its a stressful job and serving a large group is a pain in the ass, but 1 hour for pasta that tasted raw?? I think the owners/manager can afford to hire more people. The bad service is reflective of poor management."	1star
I was able to made a quick and easy reservation on Yelp App.  The decor and outside patio area was very cute!  I went with a group of friends after work and has the following that were great portions and delicious:  Tuna Tartar guac  Beet salad Steak and fries Green pasta Sea bass  Def glad we came here!	4star
I ordered R3. Hot chili fish w/ rice for price is 11.99, and I took out for eating. I found there was only few!!!fish slides and  it doesn't come with rice(it should be). It was not worth the price that I paid for it. It is terrible experience with this restaurant  :(	1star
This place is small but impressive. The restaurant is clean, well lit and on the night I went, the playlist consisted mostly of reggae (old & new) which set a mellow vibe. The staff were warm, welcoming, & helpful; the manager or owner came out to check on my friend and I a couple times, which was nice. The drinks were delicious. My friend and I had mojitos and they were made just right. I had a Cuban sandwich and it was fresh, & juicy - just like the ones I enjoyed in Miami but with a little twist. It was also so big that I had only had room for half of it. I would definitely come back.	5star
"Unfortunately, it doesn't matter how good your food tastes. Rude employees--from host to wait staff--will overshadow EVERY TIME.  I went to St. Anselm on a Friday night with my girlfriend around 6 (probably one of the busier nights) and was greeted with the option of a 1 1/2 hour wait for bar seating and 2 1/2 hours for a table.  The host was almost upset that I wanted to wait for the table, as if him getting out of work early was contingent on my dining coming to an end.  Let's face it, I don't know about you but I'm not settling for a bar top from such an acclaimed steak house, so I agreed to leave my number and to be contacted in 2 1/2 hours. I was told to head next door to their ""waiting bar"" which is Spuyten Duvel.  Don't even bother, place smelled like a gym locker room.  Immediately walked out of Spuyten and proceeded to Extra Fancy which I've always enjoyed. So, fast forward 2 1/2 hours and no text.  Now listen, I get it.  How could an establishment pinpoint when an individual will finish there meal I mean it's probably very hard.  Wait times are probably a calculated round-about.  Anyway, I walk back into St. Anselm and ask the same host what the status of my table is.  He says ""Oh they're just finishing desert, probably another 15 minutes.  Please follow me to our back outdoor garden area"".  You're diverted out of the steakhouse at all costs is what I'm getting at people.  So again, diverted to yet another waiting spot.  30 minutes goes by and now I'm pissed.  I go back in and there's a table I see with nobody sitting at it, all cleaned and dressed with silverware, plates, and napkins.  I go up to the host and ask ""What's going on? Is that table right there available?"" To which he replies ""Oh, yea.. go ahead and sit there"".  I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU TO COME GET ME OUTSIDE IN YOUR STUPID BACK GARDEN HIPSTER HANGOUT.  HOW CAN ANYONE BE SO NONCHALANT ABOUT THIS AFTER WAITING TO EAT FOR 3 HOURS?! Bottom line guys,  not worth your precious time.  The food was good but a place like this is defined by the experience--and this was clearly a terrible one. Seems to be one shared by many other reviewers here."	1star
Good spot if you're a tourist with kids- but if you care about dining experience, quality of food, or having pleasant servers who are happy with their jobs - this is not the place for you.  The location is phenomenal- so they could surely improve the monetization of this restaurant. It's just too bad they can't get their act together to do so.	1star
I really really wanted to like this place.  My friend and I got take out from there He had the zhajiangmian  and I had the braised pork slices in soup. The actual noodles were really tasty but after we ate we both got killer headaches and stomach aches. I don't know if it was just an off day or what but it was bad and it was also a tad annoying how we ordered online came in 30 minutes after our order it still wasn't ready even though the place was empty. The noodles were def tasty but I don't know if the after party with the bathroom is worth it	2star
I had heard great things about this restaurant but they do not take reservations so we thought we would try a summer Friday with the hopes it would be quieter. We put our names on the list by 6:45 pm and we were told 45 min - 1 hr but it was more like 1 hr and 30 min. Heard some others talking that they were given an underestimate too by a long shot. I will say though that they have a great seating area outside where you can order cocktails.  We finally sat down. Important to know that most of the tables are communal tables, so you might sit next to people you don't know.  Our waiter was extremely helpful and service was great. We ordered the guacamole and Tuna poke, which I was most excited about. The guacamole had great flavor to it but the chips were a little hard. The poke was ok, but came with a lot of cabbage and they forgot the avocado. I brought the lack of avocado to their attention and they brought me a side of sliced avocado, but it just wasn't the same. For the main course, I ordered the seared fish tacos (comes with 2 tacos). These were delish and have a great refried-like black bean mix on top. These are a must.  For dessert, the chocolate coconut soft serve on a cone was great!  I would go back on an off peak time/day to try some other items on the mebu.	3star
I had very high hopes for this place given all the great reviews on Yelp claiming to be the best food in the area.  We must have ordered the wrong items, because we were less than satisfied. We both ordered the Fusilli Silani and it was basically store bought pasta, sauce that tasted like a jar of Ragu and a big gob of mozzarella cheese on top. Nothing special, and I have made better dishes in my microwave than this one. In addition, service was slow, had to ask several times for more bread. The place is very crammed, so expect to hear the conversations around you.  Overall,  do not recommend.	2star
I came here for lunch. Seems like this place is more poppin during dinner. The dinner menu has more of the traditional Korean dishes and nice deals. The lunch menu was okay. Nice place to try traditional Korean food with a twist since its fusion. I would like to come back during dinner and see what it's like. Although I'm not a fan of crowds... For lunch I had the bulgolgi bibimbap. Definitely disappointed that there was no crunchy rice along the bowl. But besides that it tasted like a traditional Bibimbap. Since it was a long wait for the food our waiter gave us free hibiscus lemonade. Taste was wonderful. It was very bubbly.	3star
"So I've heard good things about this place where ""Beets"" are the star and worked into many dishes.  Aside from the beet ketchup and hot sauce (which was really good btw), we opted to try other popular items.  We shared the Halusky and the Original burger with a cocktail and their signature beer.  Halusky was heavy. Sausage, pork belly that tasted more like thick cut Canadian ham drowned in Gouda, sautéed onions and nougatine dumplings. It was small in size but boy did it pack a punch. I would've liked some pita or crostini to accompany this as it were a bit salty for my sensitive palate, but at that rate, the appetizer would've sufficiently fed 2 people.  The Original burger, medium rare, was dressed with pickled relish and applewood bacon and encased in fried dough, not unlike a doughnut. Someone described it like a burger pie. I would say a burger knish or a burger patty. That is their unique spin on reinventing the burger. And BBC deserves praise. Fun, easy to hold and eat. The burger meat was juicy and delicious. I do miss my regular buns though. Maybe 2nd time's the charm. Oh, and their skinny square fries deserve an honorable mention. So good and crispy, we finish every last one with the hot sauce that tasted like tangy salsa with a kick. You can purchase by the bottle.  A quaint place for a relaxing late lunch."	3star
We had really high expectations for Babbo because PASTA TASTING MENU? It could have either been the best thing to ever possibly happen to my mouth or the most average thing to ever happen to my mouth. Turns out it was somewhere in between - our experience was pretty marred because we didn't make a booking in time so decided to rock up for one of the walk-in tables (there are about three up front), and we happened to come at a time where the wait was approximated at an hour.  You should be able to leave your name, sit at the bar or leave and come back, right?! Nope. There was no room at the bar and instead of letting us go outside and sit in the park and return, we were told that we had to stand in the tiny area between the front desk and the constantly opening door - multiple people confused us as the hosts of Babbo, and we ended up waiting for an hour and a half. This could have been avoided if they simply let us walk outside and come back in 45 minutes. The reason they cited was that 'they didn't want patrons sitting down to think we just walked in off the street' - this is kind of ridiculous because its common practice in New York. After that, our server was lovely and the food was decent - definitely pasta in a way I haven't eaten before, and everything was fresh and subtle. The olive oil dessert was particularly good!	3star
So, I must say TRAIF stole my heart from beginning to end. The staff was very pleasant. I had an 8pm reservation. I was on time but unfortunately my friends were late. I didn't have a problem with parking I actually got a spot as soon as I pulled up in front of the restaurant. I told the hostess my party was running behind and I was told I would be seated when everyone arrived. No problem. I waited for a while and was then told I could have a seat at my table to wait for my guest. I like to drink so I decided on the Red Pearl while I waited. This drink is not for everyone because of the Chile spice. For some this can be spicy for me it was amazing. It matched my personality completely- spicy, sweet and making you want more, or so I think. My friends arrive and we are ready to dive into the chefs selection. Only one problem, the server asked if we wanted to be adventurous or keep it cool. I love adventure and new things but my friends not so much. So, we told him to meet us in the middle and mix it up. We started with a complimentary carrot soup that was very good. It was earthy, and along the lines of comfort food. Each dish was unique in its on way. The tuna tartare was amazing. The flavors burst in your mouth. I could have eaten at least 3 more. The tuna was placed on top of a fried eggplant. Really good. The scallops were seared well. A bit to much salt but nice flavors. I think the duck was prepared with 5  spice seasoning with prunes and olives on the side. The Buffalo frog legs, taste like chicken to me. The strawberry cinnamon glazed bbq ribs is on the sweeter side and slid right off the bone. The pork belly is a bite size piece that had a nice crisp on one side. Beets can sometimes have a mild bitter taste, but that was masked with great pairing of goat cheese, cranberries, arugula and a type of nut I do not remember. Every bite better than the first. The pasta was sprinkle with parmesan cheese with crispy medium cooked bacon cooked to perfection not to soft or to al dente. The bbq sliders came out with sweet potato fries and I had to take a couple of breaths to make room for food. Sigh. Now onto dessert. We had the key lime pie and the bacon donuts. I always state I am not a sweets person, but I'm still going to try it. The key lime pie was actually good. It was nice and tart with a great graham cracker crust. The pineapple garnish on top made it a bit to sweet for me. The donuts reminded me of a more dense beignet topped with bits of bacon with a side of ice cream. Very nice touch to end the night. Overall, I am extremely pleased with the tasting, service, and staff. I definitely recommend this place as well as the chef selection!	5star
Eh.  Service was great. We had to wait 20mins to sit but they called us back when a seat opened up and service was prompt and very nice.  Food was ok. Except that they ran out of half of the food on the menu before 7:30pm. Nothing special and very expensive for what you get. We got an assortment of appetizers. $19 for 3 ok sliders? Not worth. The buns were nicely toasted but the overall flavor was nothing special. $19 for 3 small fish tacos? Again if it was amazing I wouldn't mind but the flavor was a bit one dimensional. The fish was prepared well and perfectly crispy but the flavor was a bit lacking.  What was most disappointing was the bokchoy. $9 for literally 6 tiny leaves of bokchoy in what tasted like store bought oyster sauce? Definitely a rip off. The mango bar dessert was again ok. A bit too sweet and the coconut shavings gave it an overly chewy texture. Overall, there's nothing really special about this place. The drinks looks nice but the food was mediocre. Not worth the price.	3star

"I was excited to take my significant other for valentine days at what seems to be a very romantic spot. When we got there ""Koby"" (he calls himself host and ""owner"") said that there were no tables in the back garden. I walked to the garden and see multiple tables empty and he refused to go back and look, he stormed off saying I wasn't understanding the fact I couldn't sit in the back. The waiter however politely sat me down in the garden and was delightful. Food was good, not the best Thai in the city but the back garden is very pretty.  When we were leaving I told ""Koby"" that as a host you shouldn't be so rude to your customers and he said the ""customers are not always right"". I told him that i want to speak to the owner because never in my years of dining in NYC have I ever experienced such rude service and attitude. He then said ""you can leave if you're not having a good time."" He said this in front of the whole restaurant and other customers were disturbed by his loud tone.  Food 3/5 Ambiance 3.5/5 Service 4/5 Host -30/5 (yes that's a negative) At least I won't ever see ""Koby"" again! Because I'm never coming back. Or at least until they fire him."	1star
Amelie knocked my socks off. The food was absolutely exquisite. Their wine selection is extensive, with some experimental and classic gems! We started with the goat cheese balls, a simple dish with three to four ingredients prepared with incredible skill. The cheese melts in your mouth, and the crunchiness lends to a diverse texture. Then I did the gratin, and I recommend you do it with the truffle shavings! Finally we finished with the creme brûlée, beautifully prepared. All in all, this establishment is a mainstay for die hard French food lovers and wine fanatics. If you're one of the two (or both like me!) I couldn't recommend it more.	5star
I often find restaurants that call themselves No.1 suspicious. In my experience, self-claimed restaurants tend to fail at delivering the expectations. Not sure if they're really the best Tacos in New York (we're tourists), but they're by far the best Tacos we've had in a while ... and we're from the Bay Area, California where Tacos are taken seriously! Location (5/5): Los Tacos #1 is conveniently located near Time Square and close to many nearby attractions (a couple of Broadway shows).  Fortunately, the street it's on isn't too crowded which makes the restaurant easily accessible. Services (5/5): We came around dinner and the line was relatively short and fast-moving. After we placed our order, we gave our ticket to the chef and had our tacos within a minute. They also replenish the salsa bar and clean the tables frequently! Food (5/5): As I mentioned before, we eat a lot of tacos in California and even make our own tacos every (ok not every) Tuesday. We had the carne asada, pollo, and pork tacos with a side of chips and salsa. MAN, these are GOOD!!! The seasoning was on point and rival if not surpass some of the best Tacos in California! When you order chips and salsa, they provide you with some chips (duh) and medium salsa. If you like your salsa chunky with pico de gallo like we do, add some from the bar for amazing salsa for your chips or tacos! #foodiehack  Our stay was short but Los Tacos#1 is one of those places we're definitely revisiting when we come back to New York.	5star
This was on my list to visit and we finally made it there.  We did the chef tasting with wine pairing on a weekday and we were a bit disappointed with the food.  They over cheese a couple dishes.  Tried a bit hard to add extra flavors to the dish but end up just masking the main ingredient itself (i.e. the foie gras dish and burrata dish).  The wine pairing was nice and service was good but the food was disappointing and shame on us because we wanted an easy dinner so we didn't even look at the menu details and went straight for the chef tasting.  We should have picked our individual dishes because let's face it, unlike a sushi omakase tasting, there's more room for disappointment in a tapas tasting.	2star
Everyone raves about this place, even tourists. I don't understand the hype at all. They do give a lot of food for $6, but they also overcharge you for drinks which are an extra $2. I'm from Queens, so the halal carts around here would give you food + drink for a price of $6.  Their food is okay. The chicken is not as flavorful as other places. I also feel like their white sauce is watered down because no matter how much you put, something somehow seeps it and it disappears? There are better, underrated halal carts around the area that are more worth it. There's also always a line here and last time, I waited 20 minutes when I was the 6th person on line.	3star
This is the place where Korean food comes to die. I had a weak moment and went looking for my mama's cooking in the wrong place. Their waitstaff has no idea how to handle the timing of reservations and/or busy nights, and whoever is cooking the food is afraid of seasoning and clearly takes no pride in what they're doing at all.  Believe all the bad reviews, there's a reason why Korean people don't come here.	1star
I got to give a shout out to my buddy Drew A. of Yelp fame for recommending me this pizza place. This is a top 3 pizza of all time for me, and I can't really tell you where I've had a better one, just that it's hard to rank when you're talking top places you've ever been. Roberta's is a bit of a cross between New York style and Neopolitan - at least that's how I felt. The unique crispness while still being thin and chewy crust of a New York style pizza along with the favored toppings of Neopolitan, like eggs and preserved meat like guanciale. One thing that I noticed that set it apart from Neopolitan is the middle was not as wet. Anyhow, the Bee sting has a great flavor profile with the addition of honey bringing a uniqueness to it. However, I have no doubt all their pizzas would be delicious because their crust and cheese are just top notch. It is a bit pricier than your typical pizza joint, but the flavors here blow away a place like Lombardi's for me. I wish I had time to try a lot more New York Pizza, but I'm glad I checked this place off the list. For now I'll just have to settle for Secret Pizza in Vegas.	5star
This is my second time here and finally brought my BF after raving about it for so long! Fried chicken & waffles - SO GOOD. MUST GET! Sausage bits & gravy- CANNOT GET ENOUGH OF THIS! Also had their almond crunch donut (?) and the blueberry corncake donut(?) BOTH were very good! Mind you, the blueberry corncake isn't flaky, but more along the lines of a circular muffin? (sorry, totally making up names for them but hope the description helps!) We were SO FULL and the meal lasted us the WHOLE DAY (ate around 11AM on a Wednesday) without the feeling of food coma. IDK what that says about this place but I'LL BE BACK!	4star
I loved the vibe of the restaurant with the rustic decor yet modern elegance. My friend & I ordered a few cocktails plus an appetizer each. The two drinks I got were really good, would definitely ordered again. I also ordered the pumpkin gnocchi, which I was disappointed in. For an $11 appetizer, the portion was really small & the gnocchi itself was way too dense.  I was upset when I received the bill though.. $50 for an appetizer, 2 cocktails, & 1 beer during HH?? Apparently none of the drinks I ordered were part of HH.. which they failed to let us know. They never handed us a separate menu for happy hour or pointed out which drinks were & weren't discounted. I should've known better & asked but on an empty Wednesday afternoon, I assumed it went without saying that we came solely for HH. Had high hopes for this place but too disappointed to come back & give it another chance.	2star

My single star review for this place is not reflective of the food.  As you can see in photos and comments from other Yelpers, the chicken and waffles is all the fried goodness that we were looking for.   However, I had to leave this review for the hospitality that was anything but southern at Sylvia's.  Maybe when Sylvia was alive things were run differently, but our experience from the moment we walked in was anything but welcoming.  Here is a list of things that were surprising to our small group that evening: 1.  Completely understaffed:    There were three groups waiting to be seated on a Tuesday evening.  We'd all been waiting for about 20 minutes, when a friend of the staff came in with a large group (6 people) with no reservation and was seated right away.  And when we finally were seated after a 30 minute wait, we walked into a room that had easily 8-10 available tables! Our waters also were never refilled, and it took more than awhile to receive the bill.   2.  Outrageous restaurant policy:  Each person seated MUST order at least one entree (at $15 minimum). Prices weren't as affordable as other soul food spots in Harlem, so a couple in our group of three was going to split an entree and order 1-2 sides.  After waiting awhile for the waitress to come take our order, she informed us of the policy in a rude and impatient manner.  For fear that she wouldn't return promptly, we quickly tried to sort ordering another entree out before she left. 3.  No split checks.   We planned on doing an even 50-50 split of the bill, but were informed they don't offer this convenience to customers. When we finally got the card back, it was the credit card from another table! I wish we had the opportunity to meet Sylvia who clearly made a wonderful reputation for this place and did a lot for her community.  However, I have to wonder about it's future, since it's clear #1 focus nowadays is MONEY and LIMITATIONS.  It seems inaccessible for the majority of its local people, and since it caters to tourists now, it has no apparent intention of making a customer feel comfortable, accommodated, or important.  I'll definitely be having fried chicken and waffles at another spot in Harlem next time.  It's always an amazing dish anyway, and was in all honesty great but nothing out of the ordinary at Sylvia's.	1star
"Overall rating: Such good shrimp wontons!!!! I really liked the shrimp wonton noodles. Quick and great, I would definitely go back again! Food: My boyfriend and I each had a bowl of shrimp wonton noodles and shared an order of xiao long bao (soup dumplings). The wontons were SO 香. There's no other way to describe it. They were very similar to how my mom makes them, which is definitely a compliment. I also really liked the noodles and soup, it wasn't salty, but it was still very flavorful and aromatic. The soup dumplings were alright. The flavors were good, but the meat was loose and basically mixed it with the soup. If you want good soup dumplings that have that ""bitey"" feeling, go to Joe's Shanghai.  Cost: The total for 2 bowls of noodles (one large and one regular) and dumplings was about $20. Definitely a great price for the amount of food and quality we got.  Atmosphere/Appearance: The space was crowded, but, luckily, we got a seat immediately. The space was kind of small (but clean!) so it's very likely that you'll end up sharing a table with another party, but that wasn't a big deal for me. The atmosphere was cozy and casual.  Service: The staff was on top of everything and efficient. It definitely helps if you can speak Cantonese or Mandarin, but I'm sure you'll be ok if you didn't (like our neighbors)."	5star
Staff named Leah wasted my time and was rude over the phone. Placed an inquiry about dining with children (was unsure since there were mixed reviews and thus the inquiry). Instead of just answering me via email to say No, asked to speak to me and wasted my time over the phone to just say we have no accommodations for children, no warmth or even Im sorry but we currently do not have the ability to accommodate children in our dining room. The stress on using a term such as sorry instead of giving me attitude like it was so wrong to ask if bringing a child was possible. Mind you, it's not my first time fine dining with my little one and a lot of $$$$ and $$$$$ restaurants both James Beard  nominees/awardees and Michelin star awardees have accommodated me and my family for early dinner. I am not demanding Le Bernadin to do the same but to teach their staff to be more pleasant and accommodating over communications. Looks like it's Eleven Madison Park or Per Se for my family and I again, and no complaints. Their staff were excellently trained compared to this initial (and last) interaction with Le Bernadin.	1star
The worst place to have dinner ! The food is overprice and the portions are very small. I'm Mexican and this place brings shame to our culture. The hostess is very rude and unprofessional in her cell phone and overall it's not a friendly place	1star
I've tried to visit this place multiple times but the wait time was always way too long. I decided to go here on a Wednesday Night around 8pm. My friend and I were seated right away. The entire experience was extremely disappointing and not worth the wait.  The waitress came by a bit later and asked what we wanted to drink. We both opted for water because hey... its wednesday night! We ordered the truffle mac and cheese ($11)with corn bread ($6) as an app, this came before the water did. . I actually had to asked a second time for water and she said sure. No apology ....... some other guy brought the water too.. (the water was warm.. but watevs, i won't complain!) The top part of the mac and cheese was good but the rest of it .. eh. The cheese was not rich at all and was a tad watery. The corn bread was good but should not be $6 for a square ... pretty sure when I bake corn bread, $6 gives me an entire basket. I got the squid ink pasta with shrimp($20). The portion size was average and the overall dish was filling. I didn't particularly like the dish, i felt as though it lacked flavor but someone might enjoy it! My friend got the fried chicken BLT($14), she said the chicken was very dry and the cheese was way too overpowering. Overall, the burger/sandwich (watev) was big! The fries looked seasoned but were a tad soggy and tasteless.  Overall, I would not recommend this place for food but maybe just drinks are better.. Not sure if i'd want to spend $12 on a drink though. The ambiance itself is really gorgeous. The opened window/door concept with a rustic look is so appealing!   The Total came to $55.40 (corn bread, mac+cheese, BLT & pasta, no drinks). 18% gratuity is recommended so about $65 for over-priced mediocre food with inattentive service and a gorgeous, warm ambiance! The waitress walked by several times ... saw our tiny glasses were empty and didn't bother to fill them up......even when asked.  I really wanted to love this place but its a pass for me. Good Luck!	2star

The seating is very tight and you have to endure with the neighbors bag hitting you. Although there was a line at the entrance, the waiting time was not long for a Saturday brunch, which was good.	3star
If you have a food allergy, be it gluten, peanuts, soy, whatever,  be careful of this restaurant.   The wait staff is completely insensitive to the needs of any one with any special needs. We called ahead to make sure this restaurant could handle special allergy needs and they were very assuring that they could work with us.   When we changed our destination to this place based on their assurance, we were excited to try this place based on the reviews posted. We arrived and the server Courtney could not have been less accommodating.  Not only had whoever we talked to on the phone lied, but Courtney was dismissive and unapologetic about being unable to serve certain members of our party. Then to add insult to injury, we heard Courtney gossiping about our party and our food allergies right within ear shot. Disgusting.  Wrong.  The owner should be appalled.	1star
Pros:  the food is very, very good -- fairly good wine list and the greeters will try and accommodate you if you're a walk-in.  Cons: we're local regulars and we've noticed a recent annoying trend. There is a floater/manager that prowls the very crowded (as in close together tables) main front dining room. Young man in his 30's constantly patrols the tables looking down at everyone's table every 5 minutes. We had a reservation on the night in question and this 'floater' just didn't stop - in the span of the 75 minutes we were there, he must of rounded our 2-top, a dozen times! It was annoying and rude. We'll go back to 4-5 stars once this stops.	3star
The Boil is my favorite restaurant in New York City. Not only is the food on point, but the atmosphere is wonderful as well, and their staff was super attentive! I have been here so many times, but I always get the same thing: 2 lbs of shrimp and a pound of the snow crabs in the special Boil sauce with medium spice. The flavor is just so indescribably good! It's has such a strong buttery garlic flavor that just melts in your mouth. I can literally eat scoops of just the sauce. With our mild spice, there's just a slight kick that makes you want to keep coming back for more. Sometimes I get bread or the vermicelli noodles to dip this in.  Usually the shrimp I get falls off the skin easily, and when dipped in the sauce: heaven. The snow crab also tastes very fresh. I have trouble peeling it sometimes so I ask the wait staff for help and they always give me great tips to get the most of the fish.  For appetizers we get: cajun fries, mac and cheese, & brussels sprouts. The fries are bathed in Old Bay seasoning but it's so good because the give you a sort of tartar sauce. The mac and cheese is one of the best I've ever had! It's so cheesy with the right amount of bread crumbs. The brussels sprouts are a little weak compared to the rest of the appetizers I get because it's sort of a fish sauce/ sweet and sour taste.   The drinks there are delicious as well. I always get Crabby's Ginger Beer or the Lambic Peach beer.  The only downside about this place is the ridiculous wait, but I don't think it should affect this review. You have to go in person to make the reservation and you can even wait up to 2 hours. BUT there is a new location at Waverly place with no wait because it's so big! It's just as good I promise.	5star
Food was decent. Mac'n'Cheese was actually great. The bussers were very attentive. I wish I could say the same for rest of the waitstaff. Had to ask 3x for our drinks. Some never showed. One of our meals came out as an app - everything else came out as dinner. And Cash Only? At those prices? That's just dodgy.	2star
Sometimes the big chains get hated on for simply being too big-- and there's a temptation to take a star away because it's not a hidden small treasure of a restaurant, but good is good! I ALWAYS order the Porterhouse Contadina and soooo dang good...mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Funny it's not the Pasta dish that's got me in love w/Carmines, it's the meat dish! I haven't had a dish I didn't like and through the years i've eaten through the menu!	4star
The food is too good in there. The loaded fries with fried egg was watering my mouth. Its a peculiar taste Ive never had before. The girl that took my order was so nice & explained to me the different Vietnamese specilaties. Id like to try the sandwiches when I come back. I can still taste the explosive flavors in my mouth. JoJu definently delivered. I will certainly be back	5star
Came here on a Tuesday night at 6pm. It was fairly crowded with a 15 minutes wait. I ordered a 7 samurai lobster roll and my date ordered a lobster and burger combo. The lobster roll had way too much bread. The lobster in the roll was ok and the seasoning was pretty good. The lobster in the combo was overcooked -- the meat was too chewy. The burger was solid.  Overall, it wasn't worth the wait. You can definitely get better burgers in the city, and Luke's lobster makes better lobster rolls than b&l	3star
My favorite go to place when I'm craving either a Cuban sandwich or the mexican style corn.  I would usually eat the corn there while it's nice and hot but wait till I get home to have the Cuban sandwich because by then the perfect amount of juicy would have soaked into the bread giving it that extra flavor without making the bread soggy. Note: There is seating in the takeout portion of the restaurant but it can get crowded during lunch and on the weekends.  Fear not, there are benches outside where you can sit and enjoy your meal, especially on a beautiful day.	5star
"How they have two Michelin stars beats me.  Took them super long to get us our drinks, and barely in time for the amuse bouche. I like our wait staff minus our snooty headwaiter. They hustled us into drinking bottled water, which made me feel uncomfortable.  I'm never a fan of using candle light as the primary source, but that's really just a personal preference.  I'm usually pretty open minded with tasting menus, in fact I make a point not to look at them so I can be surprised. Sometimes flavors are lovely, sometimes they are not the favorite but for sure interesting. What gets me is when flavors are off balance or, worst case scenario, flat out disgusting. The pickled rhubarb was so over powering I didn't want to eat anymore. Then comes out crazy over salted quail. The first time I ever had a dish sent back. The barely ""risotto"" was crazy heavy. Not a good choice for a tasting menu. They didn't give me a copy of the menu so I don't remember the other dishes. The worst part for me is that even though we made the reservation several weeks in advanced, they didn't bother to prepare for my bf's dairy allergy. This was the first time at such  a ""high-end"" restaurant that they didn't prepare suitable tasting menu substitutions. They were basically like ""oh well, too bad.""  Case in point: the finishing sweet bite I received truffles, marshmallows and an assortment of other things. Bf got marshmallows, dried apricots and ""candied"" walnuts. Guess what!! The walnut weren't even candied!!! What kind of two star Michelin restaurant serves straight up walnuts and dried apricots! That is some expensive trail mix!  I had to take a picture so I've posted it here."	1star
The food menu is limited so I get pretty much the same thing I order everytime I go. The food and beer prices are very affortable.  I always get pork soup dumpling, beef cripsy crepe, and either chicken or beef rice cake. Fried rice cake with chicken or beef is a bit on the oily side.    They have Tsing Tao, corona and Budweiser for beer selection.  I would never drink their tea or water offered... not clean. Bring your water bottle please. Unless, you have no option.	4star
Can't say enough good things about this place. Owners are just wonderful people who are absolutely welcoming. The food is really authentic and is has a unique southern italian fare that you don't often find in most italian establishments in NY. Highly recommend!	5star
The worst place ever!  I ordered on seamless the order still had not arrived 1.5 hours after i ordered i had to call the restaurant they pretended they had a mix up with the order. 2hours later still no food. Food never came and i am waiting for a refund. This shit place needs to go bankrupt asap	1star
Quick review: the actual place was really good. The pizza was really taste but the crust was burnt. It is a usual coal brick oven pizza place. Nothing that special but it's nice.	4star
I don't need to elaborate too much about how oily and dissatisfying their overhyped ramen is, if I just outline briefly my experience here: 1. My boyfriend had skipped lunch that day due to an unusually busy day at work and was eager to eat. When you're especially hungry for a meal, the food tastes that much better. But he didn't think the ramen was delicious at all. In fact, none of us (3 people) even commented on how good the food was.  2. I have a pretty sensitive stomach - to spices and oily/buttery things. I ordered the small chicken ramen, and as soon as I took the first sip of the broth, I could tell just HOW much oil they poured into the ramen. Once I finished the bowl, I actually felt extremely sick - and did get sick. Not a pleasant experience immediately after a meal. The one star is for the quick and friendly service from our waitress, who kept checking up on us and took our orders in a timely manner.	1star
4 stars is only for food  Good thing one of my friend made a reservation ahead of time before tonight's dinner as the restaurant was pretty packed. I was first to arrive so I waited at the front of the house until a seat cleared up at the bar. The hostess was able to seat me and my friend at a table while we waited for our other friend to come.  Antipasti:  Polpo - woah baby what a tiny portion to share among the 3 of us but the octopus was cooked in perfection and very tender  Entree:  Linguine ai Ricci di Mare (2) - both of my friends love anything with uni but I tried the uni and it has a more fishy taste. The pasta was very yummy  Spaghetti con Prosciutto e Parmigiano (1) - yes I wanted to try their most popular dish on the menu with the cheese wheel *thanks Rick C for recommending along with other yelpers' reviews* pretty cool to watch how the server put together my dish. I wish the portion size with a tad little more pasta because I wasn't full  Desserts: *omg these desserts are bite size not to be share with your group* Torta Di Parmigiano Reggiano - the server shaved the parmigiano onto the top of the cheesecake which tasted like a pound cake. We really thought that the parmigiano was folded into the cake batter which would've taste better  Vulcano - holy moly where's the rest of the cake because it was sooooooo small  Overall it was a yummy experience but sorry it just didn't quite fulfill my hunger!	4star
"Okay... so I'm not gonna lie, the food wasn't all that bad (except for the small portions). But why I will never return to Vitae is the service (or lack thereof). Our party made a reservation, but upon walking in, we were not even acknowledged by the host for a good ten minutes because he was on the phone. To be fair, sounded like he was taking a reservation over the phone, but there is absolutely no reason why we should have waited that long.  Once seated.. the waiter gave us some time to look over the menu, but once he came over to take what we assumed would be our drink orders, he asked us right away about our entree orders. When one of us asked if there were any daily specials (the menu was much different from what we previewed on the website), the waiter replied with a ""everything on the menu is good, just pick something.""   After our meal, we asked for the check. The waiter leaves the check on the table then comes back not even 30 seconds later assuming we already left cash/credit card... god forbid we had the audacity to finish our conversation and let our food digest somewhat.  Bottom line.. food is not bad, but we did not feel welcomed."	2star
Very good lobster rolls at a decent price. I'll have to come back next time to try the crab roll and the shrimp roll .	5star
Love the vibe here. Atmosphere is open, fun and lively.  Tomato soup was as thick as pasta sauce. All we needed was fried calamari for dipping. Hearty but way too thick.  Breakfast pot pie was okay. Creamy filling with sausage, eggs and cheddar biscuit. A lot of guys got it but not many finished it. Worth a try.  Hanger steak and eggs were really good. Cooked to perfection and a nice chimichurri sauce.	4star
After waiting over an hour for a party of 3 with a child, I am not sure I see what the hype is all about. The wait staff seemed that they wanted to rush us out as quickly as we got in. Ordered and appetizer of rice balls. Not only did it not come with a side of gravy it was like biting into an ice cube. A greasy ice cube with canes peas. The flavor was lacking anything but the oil they cooked it in, which apparently is calamari.  Pizza came out next and too quickly. No flavor and it too had cold spots. My $15 chicken Marsala came out separately. Slimy chicken and did not taste fresh. Very thin. Straight out of a freezer bag. The pasta that came with it had no flavor either and was cold. Pasta was under cooked. Gravy too acidic and too watery. No bread or salad or anything. Waiter never came to ask how food was. On a side note the restrooms are not ADA compliant and very very small. Too much hype.	1star
Came here at 2:30 a.m Saturday morning and they were closed! So disappointed since they're supposed to be closed at 4 a.m. No sign on the door or anything explaining why either.  Booooo yummy Udon West. Boo. Had to go get ramen noodles a few blocks down and was so not happy!	2star
Such a huge disappointment, but what did I expect? This has become a total tourist trap. I haven't been here for more than 5 years now, but a friend suggested we grab soup dumplings from here. I was hesitant at first because of the wait, but he assured me that it was going to be 15 minutes. Surprisingly, he was right. We were seated in 15 minutes on a Friday night. Was that a sign already? We ordered one crab and one pork soup dumpling, as well as, pan fried beef rice cake. The crab soup dumplings came first. I was already disappointed to see that one has popped and 5 of them were opened. Both the soup and meat were well seasoned, but I could barely taste any crab. None of the pork ones were opened or popped, but... I had 4 that barely had any soup or no soup at all. I made sure to check if they were popped before biting into them, but they weren't and nothing leaked through the basket. The dumpling was dry, flavorless and a disappointment. The beef rice cakes weren't great either; the beef had a starchy powder feel to it and it didn't have much flavor. Joe's quality has definitely fell since the last time I was here and now I'm reminded as to why I don't come here.	2star
May be overrated if it wasn't for the family style portions. This one is located in Times Square so the crowds are insane and reservations are almost always required unless you don't mind eating at the bar. If you're at the bar you'll be very close to the couple next to you and people will constantly be passing your table closely..awkward spot. The lasagna was delicious and more than enough for 2 people. We took it home and ate lasagna for the next day and a half! Worth the $32.	4star
"Umm can you guys please clean your bathrooms!!! Came in there to wash my hands before digging into the food and almost vomited upon entering the ladies room... This thing might as well have been a porter potty as it was smeared in S@!$t!!! Talk about explosive... The other two stalls were not much better one was overflown and the other one was sort of usable but ""sort of"" are the key words here. I quickly washed my hands and ran for my life!!  And this my friends is the reason this place will get only 2 stars...  Upon returning to my table I did not recommend my friend going in there for self preservation reasons...  On to the food. That was pretty good however not as good as it would have been had my appetite not been ruined... Word of advice bring wet wipes and use the facilities before you come to this joint. Better yet just get take out..."	2star
Fun place with great BBQ and plenty of seating. Good drink selection with good music and a friendly staff. Family friendly. Only downside is they let dogs in with no restrictions. Dogs were peeing all over the place and children were crawling through   Would love to give this place 5 stars as a great summer spot but irresponsible dog owners are ruining it.	3star
This place is hopping. Great food just got greater. But more importantly the vibe is just perfect for downtown. Claudio is the consummate host. He regales customers with tales of old Italy whilst serving the freshest prosciutto and cheeses in New York I recommend the cocktails. Original and spicy. Just like da Claudio's pastas.	5star
Went today for my fiancé birthday and I must say it was a great experience. Our waiter was amazing. He was attentive , gave his own recommendation and even told me if I didn't like something he can exchange it for me. Luckily, everything We had was good. I ordered the BLT lobster roll with a lemonade. Hubby ordered the classic Maine lobster roll and a beer. My daughter ordered Mac and cheese. The rolls came with a lot of meat, juicy and flavorful. The sweet potato fries were good and we enjoyed the slaw and pickle. My daughter enjoyed the Mac and cheese too.  For dessert we had the banana bread pudding. It was a bit sweet but still  very Delish and had pieces of bananas in it. ThEy brought it with a candle and sang happy bday. Would def come back again! Only thing wish their prices were a bit more reasonable.	4star
This is a quaint cafe with great food and flavor on SoHo.  We had breakfast and drinks and their famous duck bacon.  All delicious!	5star
So disappointed... food was not tasty and very far from what we could expect from an authentic tapas restaurant. We ordered a pitcher of sangria which was mostly watery. Service was ok	2star
My favorite place for soup dumplings!! The wrapper they use is thinner and so it's not as heavy in comparison to other soup dumplings (which is like I like it). Gotta warn you though, I really only come here for the soup dumplings as every thing else is standard Chinatown fare.	4star
I love a good brunch so while visiting NYC, I went hear with some friends and was very pleased. We arrived before the restaurant opened, which I suggest you do as well as this place gets PACKED. We had a reservation so we were seated immediately(note* your whole party needs to be there to be seated) which was great, especially with the number of people waiting to get in.  We started with a round of the unlimited mimosas which were very refreshing. They kept our glasses filled consistently. To start our meal, we ordered the mac and cheese. Being from the south, I have a high standard for mac and cheese, and I'm happy to say it was really good here. I'd definitely order it again. For my meal, of course I had to go with the red velvet chicken and waffles. Oh man, oh man, this was good! The waffle had the perfect hint of red velvet flavor without overdoing it. The chicken was also prepared really well. Our waiter and service was awesome as well. I definitely must visit again while in New York!	5star
Seriously? Over hyped. Meatballs were too hard. And not enough sauce or flavor. I expect better from a place that purports to specialize in one thing.  It didn't help that the waiter overcharged me.	2star
3.5 stars. First impressions: Happy Hour is only M-Th, which was a bit of a bummer. The staircase - narrow, dark, lit only with LED lights - is an accident waiting to happen, especially after some drinks. Was confused by the TVs, which have a circle cut-out on them, thus blocking half the picture... My friend and I came on Friday afternoon around 6 PM and had to wait 15 minutes for a table. Bar service is kind of hit or miss. We got a pitcher of Allagash, which I was pleasantly surprised to see on draft. They add LED lights to their beer pitchers and towers, which makes for a fun novelty. We ordered the medium chicken combo and cheese corn to start. The corn was good but definitely not worth the price... considering it was literally just canned corn with melted cheese on top. The chicken, however, was delicious and better than Bonchon. The breading was perfectly crispy and not too salty or overwhelming. The chicken was still extremely juicy. It also comes with a small cup of pickled radish. Gets crowded easily so be careful with larger groups/make reservations! All in all, a good meal but a little overpriced for what it is.	3star
Super dank, first time in new york decided to go away from times square a bit and found this gem. Affordable and delicious	5star
Dropped in here a few days ago. Prohibition, speak easy type of interior. We had a couple cocktails each. Like many places in cities these days their drinks were very well done, but in reality we are so spoiled everywhere, I have to say while they were quite tasty, it was nothing you can't get elsewhere. (Guilty of run on sentence) We ate quite a bit. Their yoghurt topped flat bread was like a giant salad. Decent. The steak tartare was very good as was the lamb burger. Both deserve two thumbs up. Quinoa salad was nothing to write home about. Lesson here stick with the meat at this place. It was Sat night, we had no reservation. We were put on the wait list. 30 mins we were told. Many tables sat empty for 2 hours without a hint of us getting called. I know it's NY, but it's Brooklyn and very far from full. Star lost here. Where do they breed all the aloof, low IQ hosts who work in this town. Bartenders by contrast were true crowd pleasers.  Come and see but just grab a drink. Eating is too complicated and a bit hit and miss. Enjoy!	3star
Nope. Not going back. Food is literally a rip off. They spice it up as much as they can to make it taste like something and garnish it excessively so that the plate doesn't look empty. The Brussel sprouts don't even taste like anything for the excessive cheese and hot sauce on them, and the calamari are just empty deep-fried flakes. I had two glasses of wine my friends had one glass of wine and 3 drinks. That's all we ordered. Came out to be $130. Wasted.	1star
I'm giving the stars for my henny colada . Best part of the meal. Cash only ?! How annoying . But the prices of The bland food is the real kicker. The quantity is cool, but the food truly isn't good. The service also lacks much enthusiasm.	2star
"The worst night of my life. My BFF is visiting from DC and after we went shopping for our two dog rescues we bought leather leashes with matching collar from Will's leather's getting it monogrammed and I made the unfortunate decision to actually dine at this horrid place because I apparently like so many customers left my purchases behind. With 30 minutes after leaving I realized I left my bag at my table but as I returned to a unhappy staff and a rude owner with his guests, I asked for help to look for my $300 purchased item and the co- owner himself had the nerve to say ""no, you didn't have a bag""  I'm in shock and will save the world from ever coming to this hell!"	1star
Hands down this Harlem landmark has some of the best fried chicken in NYC. All of the soul food here is so good it will make you a little weak in the knees. I could write love poems to Amy Ruth's. I'm tempted to. But I'll just leave you with this - if you haven't checked this place out, you need to.	5star
Wow, this place is so popular! Figured it must be good if the place is packed. There was a 10 to 15 minute wait for a party of two which turned out to be a five minute wait. The turnover here is quick so you're guaranteed to be able to find seat fairly fast unless you have a large group. The hostess is extremely nice and well organized. It is chaotic but the food comes out quick. Just be careful sitting in the aisle seats because it's a bit tight and the waiters come by with hot plates right over your head.  Fried dumplings - good but oily. Lots of meat inside but greasy. Jap chae with chicken - huge portion for appetizer. We ended up not being able to eat it and took it to go. I did take a quick bite of it to see how it tasted and I really enjoyed it. Great flavor and lots of vegetables incorporated including broccoli, asparagus and brussel sprouts.  Hot Bibimbap with beef - this came on a legit sizzling hot plate with a semi cooked egg on top. We mixed up the dish so the egg could cooked fully and was impressed with the veggies they put in it. I think it was the first time I've seen watercress in bibimbap. I liked the bulgogi in the dish as it wasn't overly salty or sweet and complimented the rest of the dish nicely.  Service was fast so if you're really hungry, you don't have to worry about waiting forever for your food!	3star
This is a great spot on the unbeaten path in Queens.  Good atmosphere, great convos with locals, good drink selections - highly recommend the steak skewers.	5star
Everytime I travel to Manhattan, I plan a stop here. Good food, good prices.  If there is a comment, I would love it if they sold beer, but that really isn't a negative, because the Maine sodas are great.	5star
The food was delicious.  I ordered medium-well sirloin steak and fries.  It was made to perfection.  It was not bloody and had some red in the middle, which was perfect and juicy.  We also ordered some appetizers to share and my favorite was the fried zucchinis.  The french fries were also so good.  I haven't had great tasty french fries that were not soggy or too salty in awhile.  Desserts were great, too. Service was great and fast.  We made a reservation for a party of 12 folks and the table was ready for us as soon as we arrived.	5star
Got 2 fish tacos. Decent. Coming from SoCal and having a mom who cooks bomb ass food (which you better believe includes fish tacos), I have high standards. They give a tiny wedge of lime and I recommend you use the whole thing. The flavor of the taco is 7.5-8/10. Good filling meal, not anything a tourist should go out of their way to try. Also, prices need to be updated. $9 breakroom fries and 3 tacos for $10.	3star
Seriously such a great place to eat. We walked in and we're worried we wouldn't be able to eat here since we had a show to catch and the wait was an hour. But in less than 5 minutes the gentleman came over and sat us down right away. We were so appreciative of that.    The food is to die for & especially the chefs selection cheese plate. It was delicious!! We got an order of the olives and the cheese plate for our appetizers and two drinks. The fiancé ordered sea bass which was to die for and I ordered the special burger which literally melted in my mouth. Everything was great and couldn't have been happier. Service was on point and so glad we came here to eat. Highly recommended	5star
Our waiter, Jared, and their music is the best thing about this place! The food was awful, and the margaritas were watered down. Perhaps it was a fluke.. I'll never know. And there was a roach in our candle on the table.....joy. But Jared was excellent! Everything you could want in a waiter! Honestly, he was great.	2star
I know this is a new place which is probably why some people are so hyped. However if you actually go there and eat your would realize that the food is not good at all. We ordered the hamachi sashimi quick is around$20 for a portion that is 1/4 of what you would get from a nice Japanese restaurant and it's not nearly as good. The mussels are extremely sweet and greasy, possibly to mask the fact that they are not fresh. The asparagus dish doesn't make sense at all. I'm love creative dishes that have interesting combos but this one does not mix together and treated like a 3 separate things instead of one dish. As I'd eating all of these things, I thought to myself: the hummus I bought at the store today taste better than this.  I would have given it 3 stars side the service is ok, but for more than$100 for 2ppl, I feel like I have essentially been robbed by a con artist with fancy clothes.	2star
This place has a good location and a great ambience. Drinks and food was expensive. Would recommend it for a one time check-it-out kind of thing.	3star
Bad experience... we asked for the check 3 minutes after we got the food and the manager ask us if is everything okay... we said not really but he just grabbed my card and left...he send the hostess back back w our check and after signing the cc copy...while grabbing our staff to leave...another waiter came to ask us what was wrong...we try to tell him the food was  undercooked and the mussels horrible but he left and said was sorry we didn't like it...NEVER AGAIN	1star
Been waiting for a spot like this to open in the neighborhood for awhile. The beef noodle soup is fantastic.  The tangbaos are decent and it's pretty no frills and quick. Does the trick in a pinch! Plus there's a boba place next door that you can pick up a little beverage to complete the experience.	4star
"SO DISAPPOINTED in the service here! You'd think it wouldn't be a big deal. They asked me how I wanted my burger cooked. I said medium rare. They bring me a burger that is so well done it might as well be cardboard. I tell and show the waitress that it wasn't cooked as I requested. I expected, as pretty much any restaurant would do, for them to send it back and cook another one. No harm, no foul.  The waitress's  response? ""Oh, well sorry.  Do you want a box to take it home?""  ""No,"" I said, ""it was extremely overcooked and not how I ordered it. There's nothing you can do?""  Her response: ""Well sometimes the kitchen just doesn't cook it right. Do you want a box to take it home?"" No. Of course I don't want a box. It wasn't as though  I asked for something outlandish. Any decent restaurant would at least offer to cook me another burger, this time as I ordered it. An even better restaurant would offer to take it off the bill since I hardly ate any of it. But no, all I was given was the check. This is not how a restaurant provides a decent or even adequate dining experience. I used to frequent Yuca bar, but now I'll think twice."	1star
Grabbed a quick dinner, but would have appreciated a proper one next time!  Really cozy and warm atmosphere, perfect for Monday dinners.  Great meat, good service and a really really good chocolate fondant cake for dessert. Really curious about the avocado fries which I regret I didn't try.	3star
I give this place negative three stars. We paid $121.00 dollars for two tacos, guacamole, chili, and four margaritas. If you want to pay 16 dollars for one fish taco and inedible rice and beans you should come here. I literally spit the rice in a napkin as inconspicuous as possible, it was so disgusting. Deconstructed mole sauce?! Buzz words restaurants throw around ten years ago...I should of known better. Guacamole made with brown avocados at the table by your waitress with a potato masher. Stale tostada chips that were made yesterday on the side. When you start thinking, I could make better Mexican food at home, you know you made a bad decision. Be sure to order a few margaritas to help soften the sticker shock of the bill.This is the most expensive terrible Mexican food you will ever have.  Mezcal is just up the street skip this place and go pay less for better Mexican food.	1star
I would come here 1 million times for the view... Such a great view. With that said, I wouldn't come back for a dinner/meal. It is a great spot for cocktails and maybe a small bite, but not a meal. I went with 3 friends for dinner last Friday night-- There are a few tables fit for an actual meal in a few areas, however the rest of the tables are not designed for a sit down dinner-- long oval tables with a bench for 3-4 people and an ottoman on the other side. Although this may work for cocktails and a bite, it is not ideal when you are there for an actual meal. We got the SPICY COCONUT CASHEWS (not bad), FRIED FILTHY GREEN OLIVES (I would pass-- couldn't taste the blue cheese at all), ROASTED EGGPLANT DUMPLINGS (not great-- kind of disappointed), CAULIFLOWER & GRUYERE DIP (great- best thing we ate), KUROBUTA BABY BACK RIBS (I thought these were really tasty-- loved the crunchy peanuts on top), and lastly the Westlight burger (good burger).  Overall, I'm excited to come back for cocktails and the view when the weather gets nicer, however if you want a great meal-- Go to Leuca downstairs.	3star
Good tacos, but I think coming from the West Coast I've had better. I had the carne asada which I think is better than the adobada. The adobada could've been more crispy. Spicy salsa has a nice kick!	3star
Not close to being good...service was horrendous...the brisket was overcooked and the wings were dry and cold....never going back...	1star
Terrible Customer Service. My family and I came walked in to celebrate my girlfriends graduation. The atmosphere was amazing but that's about it. All of our water glasses were dirty. As a Server of a 4 star restaurant, that's unacceptable. Maybe can get away with a fork slightly dirty but all of our water glasses? I can literally chip away at grim lines. We ignored it and drank with straws. Maybe it was a be a long day. We all ordered our food, the wait wasn't that bad except that my mother in law got her food almost an hour and half later. We wouldn't have mind if it was like 30 mins different difference but an hour and half? Awful. The food was pretty small on portions but it tasted pretty damn good if I had to admit. I then ordered some white wine and my glass had like some dirty milk or whatever stain on the inside of the glass. I was revolted. I called for the waiter, who's name was Shedan or something close to that. He apologizes and brings me another Moscato but this time the glass has a lipstick stain on it. Being just fed up at this point with this I don't give a shit service, I took my napkin and just wiped it off and kept drinking to not cause a scene. As we were settling up, you can see either the server or food runner physically out how many of us in our party of 6 to automatically toss grat onto our build because I complained about the wine glass. My family was having a good time so I didn't make a scene. I wanted to believe me. They added the grat and we just payed it and left. Tl;DR Shitty service, Nasty like seriously at least check your wares before putting it on tables. Food was alright at least. Would never take my family here again.	2star
Among the most divisive rivalries in this world: Coke vs. Pepsi, Boxers vs. Briefs and Momofuku vs. Ippudo. I finally had a chance to take a stab at resolving the age old question regarding which of the two ramen joints is superior, and in my book, Ippudo has an edge...but just barely. The service: Much better than Momofuku. Having been a hostess in the past, I have to tip my hat to the girl working at Ippudo, because she was cool, collected, and organized while doing probably a hundred things at once. Despite a longer wait (both are walk-in only, but I usually wait around 25 minutes at Momofuku compared to an hour and 15 mins today), Ippudo has a far superior system - you can leave your number and will receive a text when your table is almost ready. The service wasn't exactly white glove, but it was far friendlier and more welcoming than the (dare I say it) b*tchy waitress I've been cursed with both times I went to Momofuku. The atmosphere: Better than Momofuku. The dining area is much larger than it looks, decorated beautifully, and you have more room to breathe than the cramped dining area at Momo. While the tables are still communal, you don't feel like the people next to you are sitting on your lap, and there are booths for larger parties. The food: This is where it's a real toss-up for me. I do like the fact that the menu is more varied at Ippudo, with a bunch of choices of apps and more add-ons for ramen, and they had a cool drink menu, including plum wine and shochu cocktails. The food is comparably priced (ramen = $14 at Ippudo vs. $16 at Momo, but Momo includes a poached egg which is $2 to add at Ippudo, buns = $9 for two at Ippudo, $12 for two at Momo). The ramen was larger at Ippudo, making it a better value. And the edamame with Yuzu salt that we ordered was perfect. Unfortunately, I actually thought the ramen itself was better at Momo, although marginally. The pork belly at Momo was far superior, and I liked their noodles better, but I do think Ippudo has a better broth.  Overall scoreboard: Holistically, Ippudo is better, but if I put the ramen alone head-to-head I'd probably choose Momo.	3star
The backyard garden is an natural OASIS from the city. I love the site of fishes in the pond. The sound of rolling water. The wood benches, wood trunk seats and long wood tables. So nice to be in nature, despite being in the Gowanus. If it's wet or cold outdoors, there's indoor seating. Bar stools and booth seating.  Several beers on tap. The bartender was so hospitable. She allowed me to sample a few draft beers until I decided on one. They sell food, near the entrance. Tacos and such. It's billed separately from your bar tab. Lastly, tap water self-service located towards end of the bar. Luv it!	4star
I eat here at least a couple times a month,  and am never disappointed with anything.  consistently good service, great food, and strong delicious drinks every time I go.  For food I suggest trying the lamb shank.  it is a slow cooked,  and large portion of meat,  rice,  and beans that will leave you wanting more once it's gone,  despite how full you will be once you've cleared your plate. The Carne Asada is another dish that is just fantastic. they clearly use high quality cuts of meat for all of their dishes. The tacos are also quite delicious.  I usually order the cow tongue tacos as they are very flavorful and delicious. they are served on home made corn tortillas along with some tasty sauce and vegetables (pickled carrots too which are fantastic). although the cow tongue tacos are my favorite I have tried each of the other kinds and they will not disappoint. No meal is complete without their guacamole and home made tortilla chips. I love the spicy version - I usually mix more spicy salsa into it too - it's really not that spicy.  The cocktails are strong,  flavorful,  and well balanced.  I would suggest trying the margaritas or any of the other tequila based cocktails. Only tip here would be to skip the salt. They rim the glass with a lot of salt and fill the glass to the brim which dilutes a lot of salt from the inside of the glass into the drink - we have had a few drinks ruined due to this. Also,  they sometimes forget to ask if you want to salt,  and give it to you by default so be sure to let them know.	4star
Finally able to dine at this very popular, Michelin star New American restaurant under Executive Chef Michael Anthony. The lunch tasting menu reasonably priced at $65 pp. Highlight dishes:  Warm lobster salad, Artic char, & the perfectly prepared duck breast/sausage course.  Extensive dessert list (they allow you to substitute the dessert on the tasting menu for something on the dessert menu): Tried the Strawberry/whipped cheesecake & Mango/frozen yogurt, and enjoyed both. Service - Very good. Unlike other Danny Meyer's establishments, gratuity not included here. Highly recommend. : 9 calendars	5star
I'm sad. I had higher expectations for Ippudo given that when people think of ramen in NYC, it's usually Ippudo vs Momofuku.  We ordered 2 orders of Hirata pork buns, Karaka-men, Akamaru Modern, and the Shiromarun Hakata Classic. The pork buns are tasty - fluffy soft buns with flavorful pork. However, the pork belly was not as tender as I would expect, especially considering that they are 2 pork buns for 9$. Expensive. The ramen is good, but nothing amazing. As many of the reviews said, the Akamaru Modern tastes better than the other ones. The final bill was around 80$ for 3 people, so this is a pretty pricy place for ramen.	3star
This is the place to be at happy hour from 5 to 7 pm. The deals they have are 12$USD for 6 oysters and a beer or 16$USD for 6 oysters and a glass of wine. We came here on a sunday evening right at 5 pm when they opened. There were two people ahead of us, but the place filled up fairly quickly. The meal starts off with the happy hour order. With the happy hour special, they let you select the oysters from three options (blue island #9, wild rocky point and naked cowboy). You are welcome to order more off their regular menu but the cost will be additional to the 6 oysters that comes with the happy hour order. You write down the number of oysters you want beside the kind of oysters on a checklist  and hand that to the server. This checklist becomes your receipt and a guide to how the oysters are laid out on the plate (as all oysters look the same). The fettuccine with clams is the best pasta dish without tomato or a cream sauce I have eaten in the longest time. It is definitely the highlight of the meal. For 16$USD, it is not cheap but the mouth sized pieces of clams is fresh and delicious! The parmesan and olive oil covers the fettuccine and makes it creamy. Each pasta dish is served in its own metal bowl with a lid.	5star
The restaurant is small and was packed when we got there so we ended up sitting at the counter. The food we ordered came out very quickly. Someone came by regularly to check up on us, clear plates, and refill water. Our server was very friendly and gave good drink recommendations when we asked.  We got the half bird of crispy fried chicken. The chicken lacked consistency, in terms of color, juiciness, and crispiness. The white meat was surprisingly moist (it's usually my least favorite part of the bird). The thigh, unlike the other pieces, was more heavily breaded and therefore the crispiest. The outermost layer of the thigh was so fried that the meat was chewy and dry. The inner layers  of the thigh were moister. The chicken was very flavorful, and the honey Tabasco sauce enhanced the flavor. We also got Grandma Daisy's angel biscuits and the peaches & burrata--both dishes were delicious. We shared the mini key lime pie. It was the perfect ending--light, not too sweet, with the right amount of tartness.	4star
First let's talk about the ambience, the ambience is not kid friendly but a good place for family and friend gathering however I'm pretty disappointed with the food quality and service.  We had party of 6 adults and 4 toddlers so we order quite a lot of food. I don't want to get into detail of all the dishes but wanted to mention the beef fried rice is really good but the $100 dollar seafood hotspot a true disappointment.  You really can't mess up on steaming all seafood with salt water you would assumed but come on you can't use old shrimp me and dead blue crab for this? Please clean the mussel beard.  The portion is fair but i rather have less for a better quality product.  If people want fresh seafood,  this is not the place to go maybe he only fresh seafood is the octopus and lobster on a display fish tank.	2star
Horrible food and rotten young coconut drink. Only thing nice about this place is their decor. Their food is horrible.	1star
Came in with visiting family because I'd tried this place once before, but didn't quite remember  how good the food was.  I got the Chicken Biscuit and it was FIRE. And I mean fire like hot sauce on chicken with the biscuit sitting in a pool of delicious honey butter, fire. There is something about sweet mixed with heat that gets me every time. And this biscuit delivered.  Good food at a great price and everything came out fresh. I got an Arnold Palmer, it was just OK. My sister and mom both enjoyed their meals. I mean it's chicken, biscuits, honey butter and hot sauce. What more could you ask for? Great job Pies-n-Thighs.	5star
"Wow. After five nights and four days eating and drinking our way through New York, I have to say that the meal I look back on most fondly is the dinner we had here.  We didn't plan ahead, so we didn't have reservations...and the place was packed. At 8 pm on a Friday. Craziness! Still, we added our names to the wait list, then walked next door for light apps and drinks while we waited for a table.  The process to get our names on the list wasn't exactly what I'd call ""efficient""; there were three girls working the stand that night, but apparently only one of them could add names to the list.  We were texted when our table was almost ready, which gave us time to close out next door and walk over. The place was still super packed, so we headed to the bar to grab another glass of wine while we waited.  The bartender made a great show of the fact that we didn't have reservations, and that we were still waiting for our table. We simply wanted to buy three glasses of wine and close out the tab before sitting down, but he wasn't having it.  At any rate, we were given a cute little corner table for our party of three, and sipped on our wine while going over the menu.  Our waitress was Whitney, and she was a doll. She answered the food allergy-related questions, gave us recommendations on both food and drink, and then answered our additional questions about dessert.  I ordered the sea bass entree (because me), and it was phenomenal. It was just the right amount of food on the plate, and it was expertly cooked. It was also delicious, with a good flavor that enhanced the fish, instead of overpowering it. I couldn't place the actual flavoring at the time (four glasses of wine tend to numb my taste buds), but it was distinct, yet subtle. I know I sound crazy.  Side note: while we were waiting for the food to come out, someone came by and dropped bread rolls on our plates. Of course, one of our group has a gluten allergy, so she couldn't touch the bread. We're used to that, so didn't think twice about it, but not two minutes later, another guy came by with another roll that he said was gluten free. Whitney came out right afterwards and  confirmed that it was gluten free (the one with celiac didn't believe that it could be). It was such a nice thing for Whitney to do, sending that to the table so that we could all enjoy a bit of bread.  The night ended with us ordering desserts to share. And to be honest, it was the dessert that drew us to this place to begin with. Well, specifically the different ice cream offerings.  So, we got the chocolate un-cake and a scoop each of the bourbon and brie ice creams.  The chocolate un-cake was a winner. The ice creams were a bit of a letdown, after all the anticipation. Still, two small scoops of novelty ice cream does not a dinner make, so I don't even count them in my rating.  Definitely go for the food, the wine, and the service. You won't regret it!"	4star
This looked like a cute spot for our monthly ladies dinner club and it would have been had we not been crammed in the back room which was so cramped and so loud we could barely move and barely hear each other. It was very frustrating. At one point one of the ladies needed to use the restroom and 5 out of 7 of us had to get up and leave our seats just so she could get out- someone commented it felt like being on an airplane and they were right.  The food was hit and miss. My priest stranglers with sausage was very good as was the burrata. The caesar salad was very salty and avocado salad very plain. Meatballs were lacking in flavor as well.  Overall I can't imagine I'll be back but made the best of our dinner club while we were there.	2star
There was an ice cream sundae that was to die for and the banana bread beer bottles are 8 bucks a pop. Ummm. NO.  The crowd can be sparse or full depending on the day/evening you go. Good selection of music. Typically hard to find a seat at the bar. Booths are typically available any time I stop in. Waitresses are average, no stand outs. It's right down the block from me, so it's convenient. However, if I'm up for the walk I'd rather go to the Hoppe Shop, they have ski ball. And I am never one to walk away from a ski ball challenge.	3star
Was definitely excited to try another highly rated Yelp Thai restaurant in the city so a friend and I decided to go check out Pure Thai Cookhouse.  Overall experience was disappointing! We ordered Chicken Curry Puffs, Vegetable Spring Rolls, Pad See Ew With Beef, and Jungle Curry Fried Rice With Chicken.  Portions were large for the entrees. Curry Puffs - Great, no complaints Vegetable Spring Rolls - completely bland and lacks any pickling or seasoning in the veggies itself Jungle Curry Fried Rice - Mediocre, nothing notable about it Pad See Ew with Beef - There was a weird taste to the beef that could only be described as the taste of the smell of a wet dog.  Not trying to be a douche, but that literally was our first thought after the first few bites.  I can only make an assumption the beef itself wasn't good.  Horrible dish! Overall this place is definitely, in my opinion overrated and there are many other Thai restaurants that I've been to in the city that trumps this place.  I've also traveled to Thailand and if I had the quality of food there that I had here, then I would tell you Thai food sucks! Definitely not going to return to this Thai restaurant nor will I recommend it to others.	3star
So disappointed!! Where are all these great reviews coming from? Blah service, over priced mediocre drinks and BLAND food.  Apps- lobster meatballs were just OK. Mezze plate a complete bore and good french onion soup.  Dinner-orecchiette pasta had NO flavor Short ribs- SMALL and lacking flavor. Way overpriced for the tiny piece Pork chop special-decent but dry. Had to ask for more sauce. Blue cheese and pears so of course it was decent! Lava cake- oh I mean plain chocolate cake straight out of the microwave! Needless to say I wont be returning!	2star
Pretty gosh darn amazing, just shy of being a five-star restaurant. The food for the most part was good, the dessert was a miss, the portions were a tad on the tiny side. Service was impeccable.  Let me start with the wine, I had a great glass of Chianti and I'm always impressed when a restaurant has good Chianti, which can be hard to find outside of Italy. We ordered the braised short ribs appetizer, which was delicious! I had their famous spaghetti, which was good, but not blow-your-mind good. Had a taste of my friend's short rib and bone marrow agnolotti, which was creamy and delicious. The coconut panna cotta was a miss - they're not kidding when they say it's served in a guava soup, while it sounds amazing on paper, it didn't translate well on the actual plate. It felt like I was eating something very gelatinous...not what you want for dessert. Great attention to detail, we were waited on attentively, not just by our server but the bus boy as well. Decor and ambiance is dark and romantic, this is a great spot to catch up with an old friend or bring a date. And here's an important tip if you're like me and can't find the place, there's no sign outside, not that I saw anyway - look for a white brick facade that says 355 on it, it's next to the really loud (as in colorful) diner next door on the corner.	4star
"The host was racist. And I don't like throwing around that term. He didn't take our reservation because our friend was still outside, but he took the reservations of two white groups whose parties weren't all there yet.  We asked if we could sit at the bar and wait. He told us, ""It's first come first serve."" Then a white lady walked in and asked the same thing, and he said ""Right this way, this is the best spot to sit if you're waiting for a table."" I wonder what was different. We left rather than submit ourselves to this treatment.  2 stars for good food when you have a different host."	2star
ShakeShack - not sure if you ever heard of pre bussing and clearing tables but please get your act together! When customers are spending +$50 to eat in and they can't get a table because other customers are over staying their welcome (finished eating their food etc) then you got a problem brewing.  Your food is good BUT not that good to be worth the hassle and risk of not getting somewhere to sit time and time again.  Sort it out. This location is the worst for this issue that I have seen btw.	2star
I have been here least 5 times. Place is kinda noisy and server's aren't as attentive as they should. What's probably how they are compensated.  This place only take CASH so be sure to bring plenty of Mula with you if you are treating. Pricing on any item on menu actually below overage compared to other restaurants around. Food: You must try their whole fries snapper, drunken noodle. However you won't be disappointed with anything off the menu. Everything is delicious. I would give consistency of dishes 70%. They always dosent turn our exactly as you had last time. If you have a favorite dish and the way you like, you should explain the server exactly how you want. For example couple of times I found my drunken noodles little soggy. I like my drunken noodles charred.  Weekends: Line is longer than half hour on any weekend so be prepared or call ahead. Bottom line: I will come here again again because places like this makes me like Thai more and more!	4star
Love this place! It's like a chipotle for med food. It was really, really tasty! My only qualm is that it seemed a bit dirty when i came for dinner. I guess they hadn't had much time to clean up. I wish the chairs were more comfortable also. It's good, though! I would come back, but probably for lunch.	3star
"Unbelievable 2nd trip! Dinner had been divine and the brunch was on par! The ""non-bloody"" tomatillo Bloody Mary was a refreshing twist on an all-time favorite drink of mine. The chef's selection brunch met the already incredibly high bar previously set.  Taif has ruined me. I will be on an endless / fruitless quest for a better meal."	5star
I was hoping for really delicious food after seeing the great reviews, but for the cost, it was a bit of a letdown. I liked the medium rare steak's tenderness, but found the sauce in the bitoque too salty. If that had just tasted better, this dish would've been phenomenal--I mean, it's steak and potatoes. In my eyes, they had taken two wonderful ingredients and doused them in this mediocre, bizarrely unappetizing sauce. It was similar to eating a tonkotsu noodle bowl, with all of the salt but only half the flavor. I liked the complimentary bread and butter more, as well as the potatoes on their own. On 7:30 PM on a weekday, Ipanema was packed and loud, which usually isn't a problem but it wasn't the best choice for a first date. Luckily the two of us were able to be seated without reservations. The crowd seems more mature here as well. It's not a place for a casual dinner, but at the same time this only raised my expectations of the food. I can see that the dish is expensive because of the steak, but it overall seemed more fit to be served at a cozy family diner at the fraction of the cost. I was impressed with the service because I was given extra potatoes for free when the server saw that I had finished all of mine. Good service, but the prices and signature dish didn't convince me to come back again.	3star
Went here for a pre-birthday celebration because you need to be crazy with money when its a special occasion right ? Reading other reviews, we dressed up to account for the hefty bill. But may be that day, a lot of people were inc casual shorts and tees. They have two levels, we were seated in the lower level, guess its less noisy compared to the raucousness of other areas. The waitress was attentive, recommended to our tastes.  You got to order the Edamame dumplings and crispy cauliflower (has some pork) appetizers. Simply out of the world and our most favorite of the bunch. I had misgivings and I thought it would be whole edamame inside the dumplings, but they had a stellar concoction of edamame paste served with some broth and presentation of cauliflower was well thought of.  For Drinks, Cabernet was not good, tasted cheap. Smoked cocktail was kick ass if you are into chipotle flavor in your drinks. Another cocktail with whiskey was also good. They have extensive collection of gin, rum, sake so hold your reins a bit.  We ordered Monk fish (which was deep fried - good), Fried rice (yuck) for mains.  Dessert, we had high hopes on crying chocolate and maple bread pudding (they don't have almond one anymore) but not very impressed. Overall a memorable experience for us. On a side note, this place is great for huge groups, our office hosted the Christmas party here and everything was seamless, they even have a huge communal table.	4star
Alta is definitely a good tapas place. But it's also quite expensive, and your expectations scale. The plus side is that it's a nice place, very elegant. The menu does have some things that are more unique relative to other tapas places. That said, they're only more unique, not necessarily more delicious. I can't say that I regret coming here but I don't ever plan to come back. Bocqueria and Sala 19 are a little more conventional, but the food is also better at little more than half the cost. I suppose if you really go to tapas often enough to get tired of other places you may want to work Alta into your rotation. But if I'm going to a tapas place once every few months it will not be this one. Also, minus a full star for only accepting cash and Amex. It's fairly ridiculous to not accept 3/4 of the major credit card companies, at a place where your cheque is likely to be a couple hundred dollars or more.	2star
Quality went way, way, way down since I had gone. Prices have gone up and sandwiches are now getting into an overpriced range. The portion size has gotten smaller and smaller. The flavor of the meats and cheese seems to have gradually declined as well.	2star
Perfect for a low-key evening on a weekday. Love the garden backyard with stream and koi pond. Seafood was fresh and fried, bar food style.	4star
This place really surprised me! They serve a couple of over the time items which can usually be hit or miss and here they were a hit! The breakroom fries had French fries, tots, bacon, pork belly and cheese. Topped with an egg and jalapeño. A lot of flavors and textures that al worked together. Also had the burger of the month with two patties, pork belly, onion ring, and mac and cheese. It was pure decadence. Barry hardy but everything was cooked and seasoned very well. Can't wait to go back!	5star
Our bill came out to $550 EACH. Yes, $1,100!!! The service was impeccable, but the food was rushed and was absolutely not worth the $1,100 price tag.  I will never go back.	1star
The food itself was good (not amazing, necessarily, but solid Italian food) and the wine was excellent, especially with the 50% off all bottles deal they had going while we were there.  If only the servers left us alone for more than a minute! It really killed the ambiance to have our conversation interrupted every minute or two for constant water and wine refills. But I could have let that pass if not for what happened at the very end--the host completely pressured us to leave a review online before we left the restaurant. A polite request to review if we liked the meal might have been okay, but it was handled really awkwardly, and then coming over a second time to make sure I did it before leaving was way too far. I don't know if he had pressure put on him or what, but I would definitely not go back there because of that alone.	3star
Stopped here after an event at Barclay's Center on the recommendation of one of our friends, who is a pizza chef.  There was a very little bit of a wait for our walk in party of 6 so we got a drink at the bar, then were promptly seated.  We got a four cheese pizza and also a pepperoni.  As hungry as we were, we still couldn't finish both pies ... and it was so good that I completely overate .... on purpose.  The sauce was flavorful, the pepperoni seared to perfection and very cheesy with a light and heavenly crust.  Totally great experience!	5star
To illustrate the experience, my Dominicana waitress made everything here much better.  In an average restaurant, Cuban food is best sold with not aspiring to be part of another country/fusion. Located at a prime and renowned sector of the city, this establishment, brings culture to life on all levels. I've no doubt that other people also get the same old school NYC diner vibe here as well.  I'd advise to sick to the anything on the menu and the array of salads were delicious.  The Cuban Sandwich is great unless you are a snob and avoid ham (pork). The chicken salad was also a hit and they didn't have to try too hard. The chicken was very tasteful ! Damn, if you are big .....the restrooms are really tight in space. There were other things, but these illustrate the experience.  The considering of dining here vesus others, is a good choice. Just be advised that is does get extremely busy.	5star
Highlights: -Sundried tomato puree, pesto and pine nuts brushcetta - solid, nice flavored tomato spread bruschetta & pesto - feels light -Calamari grigliati - lightly breaded calamari with frisee salad - light,bright, slightly acidic, refreshing salad topped with sauteed calamari -Mezzelune Alla Boscaiola - half moon shaped ravioli filled with prosciutto and mozzarella served in creamy wild mushroom sauce - star of the meal today.  Savory prosciutto and cheese ravioli. Lick to the plate wild cream sauce. Sauteed wild mushrooom on top. Mix them all together. Dayum! I could die happy -Brunch specials - 19.5 dollars for a brunch entry + side + cocktails --- Pretty Good deal! However, the price at the menu may not be the most accurate. My mezzelune came up to $20 in the final charge. The menu says $19. Not a big deal, but dear restaurant management please update the menu book if the price changes! This would have been a 5 star experience, but your $1 difference costs you a star off your review. But regardless of the minor complaint, I am still a fan! Would be likely to return!	4star
Good yes, great not so much.  But on Times Square I think it is hard to find great.  IT had ample space.  Decent food.  and was very clean.  We sat at the bar which I normally like because you can chat it up with the barkeep and discuss what you might do that day.  That was kind of a bust.  He really did not want to deal with the customers.  I had the pastrami omelet and was good.  Not out of this world but good.  I can see where this review is going and guess you can too.  I would recommend this for families because it does serve the needs of the masses and is pretty quick and convenient in a crazy area of town.  I just thought that at a bar you want to have a little conversation and that was very lacking.	3star
Cafe Habana is a cute little restaurant. Their elote (Mexican corn) is SOOO GOOOOD!! Their grilled skirt steak, pernil, rice and beans are flavorful and moist. You'll definitely leave here feeling full and content. The staff are really nice and attentive. This place is pretty small and it does get very packed during peak hours but it is definitely worth the wait.	5star
5 stars!  I wanted to have an enjoyable 1st time experience at Burger and Lobster and was finally convinced by my friends to go to the Midtown restaurant. I was hesitant to go to the new Midtown location since I presumed that the staff, service and food quality might be different than the Flatiron location.  I was wrong!  I opted for the Combo for 1 even though I have a bit of a shellfish allergy. The burger , lobster, salad, fries and herb lemon butter were all delicious! After a few bites of lobster I started feeling not so hot so thankfully I had my two best friend finish the lobster. Our server was great and recommended the Pink Grapefruit wine and it did not disappoint.  The hottest Isis was such a doll! She even offered to take pictures of my friends and I, the restaurant itself is very modern , new and rustic and the pictures came out great	5star
Very cool bar. They are going for the vintage look and they nailed it.  Old paper books for me yes with dozens of drinks to choose from.  Music was a little loud in the front of the room so we moved to the back and sat at the bar.  Bartender was quick to grab our drinks despite how busy it was.  We got their version of the mule and a whiskey drink called SGT OConnell. Both were delicious so we ordered some food. The pork buns are delicious with nice little soft buns and a good aioli dipping sauce on the side.  Would highly recommend this bar for someone looking for a quick bite and a good drink.	5star
With the reviews my expectations for sons of thunder were high but then brought down really low. Maybe it was the worker who took my order but I was steered in a direction of a really bland... unfolding poke bowl (I've been to many poke places and this one was the most unhelpful one). Not only are they on the pricier side but besides soy sauce there's not really much flavor. Also, there isn't much choices/add one.  Was not worth it in my opinion.	2star
I've eaten here in the past with pretty good results. Had the brisket for 2 at $29/lbs this time.  It was dry and overcooked.  Very disappointed.	1star
Place is cool looking and roomy, service is great, but food is small. Good thing the prices aren't crazy, because you don't get much. I ordered Huevos Rancheros thinking it would be...different. I got two big tortilla chips slathered with beans, sauce and cheese. It was one of those times when my food arrived and I was instantly underwhelmed. It wasn't tasty enough to love it even though it was small. Probably won't be back.	3star
"This place got 2 stars because of vibe and drinks. Service wasn't bad, but I had my own distaste to certain things.  Tl;dr - come for the drinks only, eat somewhere else. The big attraction of this place is the size of their drinks, as they are made to share. We ordered the big Kahuna as well ($100) and it had the flare and whistles, but it really is meant for 8-10 people, not the 6-8 people they say it's for. It was tasty and I recommend if you have a large party. This alone would probably be the only drink order you'll need. What I disliked the most (and I get it, it's a business) is that the waiter kept insisting on recommending us food dishes and after the 4th attempt, it got annoying. This was probably due to our large party size, but after the second no, I'd take that as a hint to stop. Food - they have plates to share, but it's an absolute disgrace on the portion to ""share."" I'm a big advocate of this eating format and maybe I've been spoiled in my other eating ventures, but the food portions here were miniscule. They are easily targeted for out of towners who don't know where else to eat. Not all sharing dishes are like this, but a large majority are.  We requested if a pitcher of water can be left on the table (as we drink a lot of water) and twice the waiter disregard the question. The waiter did acknowledge and hear me, but ignored my requests if it was possible. It's simple, if you can't then say no. Don't just ignore the question.  Overall the vibe and atmosphere was dope. The drink sizes were definitely great (the sharing ones) and worth the $. Unfortunately this place did have it's downfalls, in my point of view. If this was just a place I would go to for drinks only, I'd give maybe 3.5/5 stars, but accounting for everything, I'd give it a solid 2/5."	2star
OK, let me say that there's lots on Balzem's menu that I still want to try. Unfortunately, I kinda whiffed on my first meal. I figured I'd try an app outside my comfort zone, and then chow down on a main dish I knew thouroughly from other restaurants. I started with prosciutto-wrapped burrata in a balsamic reduction glaze. I don't think the fattiness of the ham worked well with the soft mozzarella; more of a contrast was needed. I then had the Manti, which I've absolutely adored for like 20 years. But the dish was underperformed at this place. The dumplings were undercooked, with no real meat filling to speak of.  And the yogurt sauce was too thick, and didn't have that delicious acidic bite.	2star
"Man, I'm really bummed to be giving Blue Ribbon a low review. I've heard great things about it for years, and wanted to love it. To be fair: at many other restaurants this would have been a 3-star review, but the bar is higher for such an esteemed and established dining institution. Oysters: Really good, but credit goes to the ocean, not the restaurant. Smoked trout: Not the best smoked fish I ever had, but pretty good and the accompanying pickled beets and cream cheese/tartar-type sauce was spot on. Escargot: Very interesting, but flawed. The sweet potatoes, mushrooms and bacon were great additions. The sauce was rich and deep, like a molasses-infused teriyaki sauce, but it was waaaaaay too thick and sweet. I loved the first bite, and liked every one after less. Paella Basquez: ...and the reason for the bad review. Someone from the restaurant came by to ask how it was, and I now regret not (kindly) being honest: it was not good. The rice honestly seemed like it was from a rice a roni package, due to the strange consistency, and had very little flavor. The peas and carrots seemed frozen, and the ""chorizo"" was not chorizo, but some other kind of sausage that was brown/grey and tasted old and a little off. My girlfriend actually turned away and spit it back out into her napkin. And she was still less displeased with the dish than I was. Maybe the worst paella I've ever had, I truly wonder how they could have messed it up so badly. Overall, pretty disappointing. Won't be returning. DON'T get the paella. Maybe this place has simply, finally let standards go slack after so many years :/"	2star
"I have never been a person to write reviews, but my visit to sweet chick encouraged me because I felt that strongly that I needed to write about this place. The good: I have been here a few times and the food is always great (the waffles and their different types of butter are insanely good), and the service is always prompt and the employees are down to earth. Particularly Jason, a server, and Chip, the manager, are great at their respective jobs and if it wasn't for them turning a bad situation into a better one, I would not be returning, which leads me to: The bad: I should say first that I am a hostess at a very small and popular restaurant, and I was dining with my roommate who is also a hostess, along with our other friend, and we totally understand long wait times and ""hangry"" customers. However, there was an entirely different issue with the hostess, Ebony.  We arrived for brunch to what she quoted would be about an hour wait. No problem, like I said, we get it, so we put our names on the list and waited. About 5 minutes prior to what would have been our quote time, another party of three approaches and asks how long we had been waiting. We told them an hour. They proceed to go in to put their names on the list but told us that that was ""way too long to wait."" So they come back out and we can hear them say that the hostess told them they had to wait 15 minutes. We figured that meant many tables were going to open up. Nope. A few minutes later the hostess, Ebony, comes outside and calls the other party of three in front of us. When we questioned her, because we have now been waiting over an hour and because WE KNEW that party had just arrived, the hostess says that she had a POLICY to seat ""older people"" first. Given, these people were not even 60 - mid 50's at best.  We were FURIOUS at her blatant decision to disrespect us and undermine how long we had been waiting. We remained calm and waited to be seated inside which happened about 10 minutes later. The worst part is that when we sat down, we immediately asked to speak to the manager. The first thing we asked him was if the restaurant had a policy to seat older folks in front of parties who had been waiting 1+ hours to eat. He said no, which absolutely confirmed that Ebony, the hostess, purposefully LIED to our faces and ignored her duty to seat us in the proper order. Had she asked us and told us the situation, we probably would have allowed them to go first, knowing there would be another table opening soon, but the fact that she made that decision and then lied to our faces was one of the worst things I have ever seen a hostess do. Like I said, if it hadn't been for Chip and Jason, we would have left the restaurant then and there, but they made the experience better for us. It was hard to relax after trying to understand why an employee would do that to someone. It made me feel incredibly undervalued and we spoke up, but there is no telling how often she does this to people without them knowing or saying something and she is SO BAD that she is SOLELY to blame for the fact that I would hesitate before coming back. I wish the rest of the sweet chick team good thoughts and just want to say to keep doing what you are doing. However, customers and employees at sweet chick should beware this hostess and know she is causing you problems and costing you business. Food is 5 stars, but I knocked two off just because of this hostess that made me feel that badly."	3star
First time here. Pretty good. Waited 30 minutes longer than our rsvp and had to wait at their busy bar with not much space. Octopus app was good. Tried the trio of apps with the chorizo, duck liver and polenta oyster. Duck liver was my favorite. Other 2 were ok. Pork chop entree was huge and tasty. Rabbit was good but nothing special. Pistachio butter cake dessert was too sweet even for me.	3star
Great Burgers. Great drinks. Great atmosphere. It was a little pricier than I thought it would be. The menu seems to change often (don't rely on yelp for that) but there are a few amazing staples.	4star
I've been here a few times with friends and decided to come recently for my boyfriend's birthday with his grandpa. We came early around 6 and sat in the back garden area. The atmosphere was great until about 8 when it got crowded and very loud. It usually is very busy especially on the weekends. Everyone enjoyed their food so we will most likely be back. It also helps that they started taking some reservations.	4star
Ate here for dinner two weeks ago. Ambiance was great, service was very good besides the fact they didn't bring us our second round of delicious bread for 30 min. after asking if we wanted more. Other than that the meal was good not great.  We did the seasonal tasting menu and had a bit of everything. It was all three of our birthdays, so they comp'd us with bubbly to start our meal and ended up giving us a coconut cake at the end in addition to our dessert.  Overall, for the price, I would have rather done the 3 course.  The $179 price for the seasonal didn't really seem worth it compared to other M star rated establishments I've been to...perhaps it was the menu itself that seemed a little underwhelming.  Would like to try for lunch or a different fall or winter menu! Marinated Scallop Fluke, Watermelon and Cilantro Lobster Salad Peaches, Basil and Pickled Peppers Hake Summer squash, Pole Beans and Dill Squid Ink Lumache Rock Shrimp, Mint and Sungold Tomatoes Pasteurized Raised Beef charred onion, wild rice and green garlic Blueberry Graham cookie crumble, basil lemon mousse Strawberry Whipped Vanilla Cheesecake, Crispy Angel Food Cake and Sorrel Ice	4star
Very very very long wait for jalapeño poppers, fried pickles & chicken strips... Over an hour wait on a Tuesday	2star
Ordered the Di Fara Classic. Pizza was mouthwateringly delicious. Simple ingredients with loads of flavor. However, the 3.5 hour wait and inconsistent time ranges that were constantly given killed the whole experience. Avoid coming on the weekends.	1star
"Food was overall simple but good. The best parts were the coliflor con almendras which was unique and tasty, as well as the kofte sliders. The pan de tomaca was nice although small. The garlic shrimp (al ajillo) wasn't as good as other Yelp reviews had touted, a little more of a ""smoky"" flavor than I like.  The atmosphere was nice and the service friendly. However, one major confusion still bugging me - we came in during happy hour (before 7 pm). The restaurant is overall pretty small, and we picked a table towards the back. We were craving the sangria, which was $7 at happy hour (instead of $10). When we tried to order, the waiter told us we could only enjoy happy hour prices if we sat AT the bar. Keep in mind, the bar is about 5 steps away from our table, and does not have enough room for the food we were ordering. We kept asking why we couldn't just order a drink and have it at our table, and the waiter simply said it wasn't possible to get happy hour prices that way. Meanwhile guests all around us were drinking wine etc. at the tables. I've never heard of anything like that and given the size of the restaurant, it really makes absolutely no sense."	3star
Ramen sounded like a good idea on a chilly Saturday night. As Yelpers do, we yelped and found Momosan.  This little restaurant has simple, chic decor and communal tables. It looks as though you'll be in close quarters, but once you are seated it isn't so bad. To take the edge off we got a carafe of the Nigori. Apparently, the sake is served to overflow into a ceramic square, it's a custom our waiter had to explain after he noticed my appalled expression. (We don't waste). For starters, we ordered the Zuke Maguyo (Tuna) and Mimiga (crispy pig ears). The crispy pig ears were good, but they were too overwhelming because of all the fat. With that said, that is my personal opinion, I am no big on fried stuff. The Zuke Maguyo was delicious and spicy, spicy, spicy. I love spicy food and the tuna made me drink water after every bite. It was my favorite. I ordered the Tantan Ramen. It is very rich and very good. My advice is, don't order the pig ears AND the tantan. The ramen was not very spicy even though it has curry. Maybe the tuna made me immune to the spice.  The food here is delicious. I would definitely return to try other items on the menu and to try one of their many sakes.	4star
This is definitely the place to be on a Friday night so then why the three stars you might ask? I had reservations for 2 people at 7PM. We were seated quickly and the back area was almost empty when we got there. We were seated at a small table; the couple next to us asked for another table since it was so tight. They were told that all other tables were being held for reservations. There are too many tables in that back room! Everyone is sitting on top of one another but I sucked it up because my girlfriend and I were there to enjoy some dinner. Luckily the food was pretty good. We started with the fried calamari, which was really tasty. Our waiter suggested it because you were able to dip it on your own. Great suggestion because although I wanted to try the mad calamari, it was drenched in sauce. My girlfriend and I went on to share a chicken parm and a meatball parm, both with pasta sides. We agreed that the chicken parm was better. I have to say, it was better than most chicken parms. For dessert, we split the brownie and it was good as well.  Overall, I think just needs a better seating arrangement. The food is good however it would be more enjoyable if you had some room to spread out and not listen to other people's conversations. Good place to catch up with a friend, not a good place for a first date. 3.5 stars. Im torn on this place for the reasons I explained above.	3star
We dined here early on a Mon 15 June - had the swordfish and vegetarian lasagne. Great food and service. Highly recommend. Travelling from Melb Australia and this is a great spot to dine.	5star
I really enjoyed the fast casual concept, and modern take on Chinese food. The interior is nice with seating for dining in. However, I thought the food was mediocre, and was disappointed that I spent $11.50 on food that I could have ordered from my local Chinese takeout place for half the price and same taste. I ordered the black bean steak, which was very tough and hard to chew. The scallion rice was okay, nothing special. I did enjoy the sautéed string beans -- that was my favorite. Would I return again? Probably not	2star
4.5 stars.  Bottomless brunch with unlimited food and drink, plus a live jazz band playing some cool music in the background - what more can you ask for? The ambiance is really cute, they even have a roofed courtyard/garden area with a lot of light. I would imagine this place would be a really cute dinner date spot as well.  Food was good with a few items stood out - we ordered multiple orders of tuna gua tart, candied bacon and french toast. The egg dishes though are just okay, nothing too exciting.  We liked the mimosas but were not a fan of couple of other cocktails. But hey, it's bottomless you can always switch out the drinks you don't like. Our server was super nice about that.  Service is fantastic but they can be a tad slow bring the food out. Drinks on the other hand were refilled diligently by our lovely server.   Overall highly recommend this place. It might be hard to get a walk in for brunch, you probably have to snatch a spot on Yelp reservation - I made mine the week of, it's still not as crazy as other popular brunch spots like Calle Ocho where you have to make reservation weeks in advance.	5star
WOW!!! Ippudo is the best ramen I have ever tried outside of Japan.  The quest for great ramen has been successful and  the search is finally over.  The flavor and saltiness of the soup base is on point.  There is nothing negative to say about this place.  The food, service, and decor of the restaurant is just amazing.   When we crave for ramen this is our go to ramen place and if you're hungry you can just order an extra order of noodles for just $2 so you can enjoy your ramen just a little more.   The wait can be long, but it definitely is worth the wait.  The best times to go are either when it opens or in the middle of the day when it's not a traditional meal time.  I'll be trying this place again soon.  In fact, I'll be going here tonight!  You definitely need to visit and eat their amazing ramen.	5star
"My dinner date and I came in to dine on a Wednesday night at about 9 o'clock.  There was a +/- 30 minute wait.  They kindly took our phone number and texted when ready, which is great.  Allowed us to have a drink at a nearby bar in the meantime (The Boil has a teeny bar, which was full at this hour). Seating is basic, with paper on the tables in a small, no-frills joint.  Our server was busy but polite.  I had an IPA, the date a diet coke.  After taking our dinner order, she brought us bibs and gloves and virtually disappeared, which neither of us minded; we didn't need anything.   We split lobster in plain butter sauce with additional corn, to keep it simple and appreciate the meat.  Also ordered shrimp with the head on in spicy 'The Boil Special' sauce.  Plus a side of rice and an order of brussel sprouts with the specific request that it all arrive together.   My date saw our brussels hanging in the kitchen window, presumably drying out, and asked what the ish was.  Told they were being held for our entrees.  That's a bummer. The idea wasn't to have the kitchen make, then hold under a heat lamp, what could've been tender and delicious brussel sprouts.  Didn't want for someone to just store my appetizer.  I could've done that at the table! So our poor waitress endured our indelicate feedback, then brought the brussels out.  Without apology.  We couldn't help but pick at them while we waited for the rest: nice sweetness to them, plus the shredded, seared pieces added texture and char to the dish.  Definitely a bit cold and wilted, but definitely tasty, too.  I'd gladly try to replicate these at home.   7 or so minutes later, our entrees arrived. We dug in to slightly overcooked but very sweet lobster, in plenty - or too much - butter/oil sauce. The added corn complimented the sweet meat and had a lovely succulence to the bite; love it when corn kernels pop!  Shrimps were also a bit overcooked and difficult to remove from their shells, but The Boil Special sauce had a great cayenne kick and garlic spice to it.  Everything was prepared with scrumptious amounts of pepper and salt.  So, though we had to work a little hard for every bite (due to over-cooking), each bite was a mindless ""yes, please"".   Super happy! Very satisfied with our bags of saucy seafood that did not lack salt or seasoning.  Hiccups aside, my date and I threw our disposable protection on the table after an hour of eating and left happy.   The tab was near $100 without tip. That's a bit much, for me.  2 beers, 2 diet cokes, 2 entrees, and an overdone appetizer? Plus basic service? I'd go back if I was certain that my pricey lobster would be cooked right and my semi-pricey shrimps were tender.  Wouldn't bother otherwise."	3star
So after 2 tries of trying to get original Halal guys in NYC and always failing both times. The third time comes around and third times a charm! My boyfriend and I had gotten here around 2am and the line wasn't long at all. There was a bit of a line but it did go by pretty quick. So have your money out and ready to give to the guy taking orders!  We got the lamb and chicken combo plate. There was a lot of food! Unlike the locations we have here in SoCal where they only give you like half of the amount they do here. They have bottles of the white and red cause on the side of the cart. However, be careful with the red sauce. IT IS HOT AF! I messed up our food because I put too much red sauce on. Even though I had already known that it was super hot. SMH.  Anyways 3 stars because I thought the original Halal guys would be better but it was just meh.	3star
I was extremely disapointed, for starters, CASH ONLY, and no sign at the door for that, in fact they have a sign that lead you to believe tgat they in fact take cards.  Now i had to run to the bank and get cash, when i came back it was almost like my waitress forgot i was there. So i waited a long time and i had already ordered before leaving to get the cash.  The food came, i got the crab and pork soup dumpling and the scalion pancakes. Lets break it down,  Scalion pancake, very good, however for the wrong reason. It is delicious because it is so deep fried that yoi can taste the oil and see it. Crab pork and soup dumpling, save the fact that i just realized that i do not know how to eat a soup dumpling ( just learned the hard way) the 6 dumplings presented to me were 5 pork and 1 crab and i was very upset at that, if im paying an extra dollar for the crab, holy wow that is ONE expensive SOUP dumpling. Also it was so hot that it burned me and nobody warned me of that.  The service was meh, i was left alone for unescessary amounts of time, when i needed things i needed to flag someone.  SO, in my opinion, the food is not everything, it tasted good, yes, but to me for the wrong reasons, i think that this place has good potential. However i think what is killing them at this moment if the floor, if the staff was a little more engaged and the food a but more on point theu can have something awesome here.  Dont get fooled but whatever you read, the experience you will have may let you down big time. So if you come here have very realistic expectations.	2star

*Came in here tonight for dinner with my husband and they were great! We Didnt't had reservations but the host seated us right away. They all was very nice & friendly. My husband had salmon with pasta & I had the 12 inch primavera brick oven pizza which was delicious. The toppings on my pizza tasted fresh that I loved & even my own husband couldn't resist from stealing more than a slice from me lol. Next, time we know to get the bigger one and split it:) My husband said his salmon was really delicious as well. We also had dessert, my husband had vanilla gelato & I had tartufo which was vanilla & chocolate ice cream topped with cherry and nuts covered with chocolate which I loved! Overall we will definitely visit again for date night:)	5star
"Well, the night started out okay. We got our drinks and apps pretty fast, and both were good. We actually really enjoyed the guacamole, but here's when it went to hell. My husband ordered the chicken enchilada and I ordered the shrimp quesadilla. The shrimp was disgusting. It tasted like it was frozen shrimp, left out all day, thawing out in room temperature. It was far from fresh, with this terrible fish taste. My husband's meal was completely inedible. They overwhelming amount of sauce that covered the enchilada was far from good, but he gave it a shot. Upon tasting the inside, he wasn't even sure it was chicken. It indeed was chicken, but it was by far the worst tasting chicken ever.  We sat there for about 15 minutes when we decided that we couldn't eat our meals, before anyone came over. Prior to that, no one had come over to check on us, not even to offer us another drink.  Explaining why we didn't eat our meals, and asking to at least give us some sort of discount or taking one of our meals off, the waitress gave us a bit of an attitude and walked away to speak with her manager.  They took my husband's dinner off the check, but what really annoyed us, is that the waitress continued to have an attitude about the shrimp and suggested that ""shrimp doesn't taste the same everywhere."" Umm, when shrimp isn't fresh, you taste the difference, no matter where you get it from...and why continue to argue, that was completely unnecessary."	1star
The noodles here are really the highlight here. You can even see them being pulled in the kitchen which is always fun.  What to get: the dumpling soup $6.5 We got the house special #1 ($8.5) and the dumpling soup.  The dumpling soup was cheaper and better. The house special #1 just had too much going on and the meat was a little fatty. The dumpling soup had a more delicious and less salty broth.	4star
"My review on this restaurant. The recipe is definitely not on Target and off by a long shot, I guess when you use organic ingredients it's not going to be the same. What makes ""Pho"" is the common denominator amongst all Vietnamese restaurants whether you try it in Georgia, California or even New York, however you are not going to find that common denominator here. The briskets were boiled instead of cutting them into thin slices and allowing the broth to cook it. The broth was what made the Pho not ""Pho"" to me in their recipe. Considering many ingredients out there that is considered to be organic, however didn't find that in the soup. The Summer Rolls were good, The Papaya salad was vegan and I get that, however come on it's not the same without the fish sauce. Give people the fish sauce and as an option give vegan option. At last but not least what makes Vietnamese sandwhiches is the radish in vinegar and they didn't use it. The prices here were ""organic"" meaning expensive, you are going to get ""organic"" ingredients however the flavor is definitely missing. I guess it would be very popular considering it's the ""garbage"" part of Brooklyn literally the sanitation dept is within 5 blocks radius. For a $17 Pho noodles the portions were not there. They didn't make the broth right and they could have used many ingredients that were organic and wasn't there. If you like Organic Restaurants give it a try, if you really like Pho and want to try a restaurant that is going to make Pho even better, this is not the restaurant for you. If you are looking for great Pho and trying something new try Lemongrass and Ginger in Whitestone. Pho 2 out of 5 stars.  Summer Rolls 4 out of 5 stars.  Pork Chop over rice 5 out of 5 stars.  Papaya Vegan Salad 2 out of 5 stars."	2star

Finally tried this place last month. After hearing rave reviews for years. I must've picked a good time to come cuz there was basically no wait for lunch yay. We ordered the sishito peppers, pork buns, their classic ramen and the upgraded classic (sorry forgot the names). Apps were good. Really not special. Ramen was delish. I'm just not a ramen aficionado to really get into it. Both bowls def had good flavors. I'm not so sure that this place is not a littlw overrated. I've. been to a couple of low profile ramen places that I may actually like better than this. Yeah, I said it.	3star
Food wss amazing. We had the chef's tasting and almost everything was great. I wasn't a fan of the terrine. The service and pace got out of whack when they started to get busy so we were waiting like 20 minutes after the 4th or 5th plate. But overall a great experience.	4star
Decent Chinese joint in Flushing that is open late. Everything is pretty average here and I usually stick with the small plate choices that they have in the prepped food trays.  I like the fact that they have a decent amount of choices.  Although, somehow I always end up getting similar things... The XLB and dumplings here are ok; nothing out of this world. I ordered fried dumplings that came out within seconds.  I mean it literally.  Seconds... Were they really for someone else...?  Didn't care.  Ate them anyway. Service is pretty sparse and you may have to throw a spoon at someone to get a little love and attention.   Don't worry.  Spoons are plastic.  Ain't gonna hurt nobody...	3star
Loved the pizza here! The crust is thin and crispy and taste amazing! The baked clams were disappointing  & were pretty small and definitely not worth it.  Service & pizza was impeccable!!! Great job to all the bar tenders & ones who served.	4star
I give Ippudo more of a 3.5, but I'm rounding down for the price. Ippudo has been on my NY bucket list for a while, and I finally got around to trying it. It ranks in the middle of the pack compared to other ramen spots I've been to.  Broth is pretty good - I'd say above average, but definitely not the best I've had. However the ramen is really brought down by the noodles. Not the usual texture or thickness I typically like better in my ramen. It didn't leave much of an impression in my mind and is definitely forgettable. We ordered the Akamaru Modern and the Karaka-men, which we found out are essentially the same except the Karaka-men is spicier. I found the Karaka-men to be better in terms of flavor, but both came off as a little too salty. The star of the meal was the pork bao. They were heavenly and really set the expectations high for the rest of the meal. I just wish there were more of them!  Overall, the food was a bit too pricey for the taste. Buns were $9 and the ramen were each $16. Even for how tasty the buns were, I don't think I'll be back.	3star
"Don't get me wrong, I loved Thursday Kitchen, but I'm not sure it's quite worth of more than 4 stars. I know I'm a bit stingy with 5-star ratings, but I'm surprised so many people gave them out such that it was boosted over 4. As you may have heard, seen, or otherwise been informed, the gimmick here is the ""adult"" capri-suns they serve. Basically, they're pouches of alcoholic lemonades and the like with light-up ice cubes inside that make them look cool. You should get one to share for your table just because it's the thing to do and only $9, but I honestly think they're a rip-off. They come with soju which isn't  too alcoholic to begin with and they barely put any in. Nice job by them though as everyone was posting pictures of themselves drinking these bad boys. The menu is small but every single item is tantalizing and delicious. We needed the waiter to point out his favorite dishes and still had trouble deciding. Highlights: - Pork Belly Tacos ($7) - juicy, well-seasoned, delicious - Edamame Dumplings ($10) - citrus-y, truffle-y, great consistency - Octopus ($12) - great sweet soy-scallion sauce/marinade Bread Pudding is one of my absolute favorite things in the world so we had to get theirs. It's matcha bread pudding which is slightly different than your typical dessert, but it was good nonetheless. This was a double-date for us and we were able to share a bunch of dishes and enjoy the eating experience together. I don't know if I'd give it 5 stars, but I'd still recommend it to anyone."	4star
"I rarely give places one star and am incredibly generous even with the worst of places (check my reviews if you don't believe me). However, this place was harder to get into than an elite club in South Beach. WTF? Dear Russel Brand look-alike host/waiter/whatever you are: you are not the bouncer of an exclusive club. Check yoself. I totally understand there is a wait for tables in such a tiny space, and it's perfectly reasonable for a place to expect that a whole party be there in order to get one.  However, spare us your snooty and uncalled for attitude. When we weren't sure our whole party was going to arrive that evening (they were running late) and were tired of waiting for a table, we asked for seats at the bar. Even for bar seats, Russel Brand lookalike with a douchier attitude insisted that we tell him ""the truth"" about who was coming even though we didn't know yet. I felt like I was being interrogated by the FBI for daring to sit my butt down on a bar stool. He then proceeded to cross us off the table waiting list.  So...we have to declare who else is coming in order to wait in two seats at the BAR? And if we say two, we won't even be able to get a table for our whole party which is arriving later? What kind of sacrilege is this? Margaritas were overpriced and difficult to drink. We left without getting food or the table we had been waiting over an hour for.  We ended up going to an amazing Mexican place right around the corner instead called CASA MEZCAL on Orchard Street. Readers: go there instead. Much better decor, it actually has its name on the door, same range of prices,  happy hour margaritas that are actually happy hour price, sweet and helpful service, and best of all? SPACE TO SIT!

Totally different salad then, what I had on Thursday. No humus, pita bread burnt. This meal cost $27. Included tip, I picked it up! Yesterday meal, I liked. It had humus, pita bread wasn't burnt, it was all white, had wine. Paid $50 with nice tip!	1star
One Star For The Fact This Establishment Delivers To Harlem Hospital, Another Star Because This Beats Eating Hospital Food. Now The Flavors Was Off I Don't Know Why It Just Wasn't Doing It For Me. My Hubsta Said It Was The Nastiest Spaghetti He Ever Tasted And That's His Fav Food. I Might Give It Another Try Just To See It The Cook Was Having An Off Day	2star
"Based on the reviews I had to try what a New York BBQ experience was.  I am glad I did- and will now move on. Place is located in Red Hook - an up-and-coming area especially for food.  Sunday afternoon was not busy.  Simple menu on the wall lists the offerings - brisket (the ""star"" of the place based on reviews, ribs- both pork and beef, sandwiches that would be expected at a BBQ joint i.e. pulled pork, brisket, and chicken wings; typical sides like mac n'cheese, collard greens and potato salad.  They did have a few interesting items like pastrami bacon and lamb banh mi.   No line and I proceeded to the counter.  The gentleman serving was very helping in selecting an appropriate amount of the food that I wanted to try (the meat items are priced by weight).  My lunch consisted of a slice of brisket, one beef rib and small orders of potato salad, and mac n'cheese along with a slice of corn bread.  Total bill $55.00.  I proceeded to the bar to get my drink - a medium sized fountain Coke set me back another $3. There is no doubt the food is very rich and flavorful.  The brisket is excellent and lean.  The sides are very well done.  There over two sauces - I prefer their spicy/sweet mix for its kick.  The beef rib?....well let's put it this way.  It was flavorful but soooo fatty.  I could hear my heart begging me to stop.  Serving this stuff should mandate the place have an ambulance parked outside in case of an emergency.  I had a hard time getting through this gristly piece of meat - it felt like a ton of bricks in my stomach and that feeling kept with me for the remainder of the day. I would likely return to this place to try their other offerings out of curiosity but will definitely stay away from the ribs.   It's definitely worth a visit, but make sure to take your Crestor before-hand."	4star
Wow great food! Max was our waiter, and he made our experience so great! Quick service and super friendly	5star
If you are sick and tired of Mexican, Chinese, Thai, and Italian fare but want to eat delicious food in good portions at a reasonable price--especially if you have young children--Nargis Bar & Grill is for you. It's only been open a little over a month and has quickly become a neighborhood fave for families. My hubby and I arrived before 7 p.m.; by 7:30 p.m. it was filling up fast. We shared the Manti (lamb and beef dumplings served with sour cream on the side), Uzbek plov (lamb rice pilaf), and a side of sautéed mixed vegetables. Everything was delicious, and we had to take home a doggie bag. The vegetables in particular were intriguing, as we tried to decipher the mixture of spices (paprika and dill?) that was a welcome surprise. I'm inspired to try to recreate the dish at home. We'll definitely come back, and look forward to adding Nargis Bar & Grill to our regular rotation of restaurants from which we order delivery.	4star
The ambiance is nice, but the food is less than adequate. The oysters had a lot of shell fragments I had to carefully remove from my mouth. The main courses were not particularly flavorful. They were lovely to look at, but left a lot to be desired in flavor. Iced tea took an hour (no explanation as to why) while the cocktails were speedier but again not great. It was worth trying once but we won't go again.	2star
No frills, hole in the wall joint. There's a few rickety tables, with a few rickety chairs for dine in service. The food is served pretty fast. The menu is pretty extensive, with the different types of noodle dishes you can order. I tried the beef noodle soup, as a craving for it led me here. I also shared the pork dumplings. The noodles tasted fresh and it did a good job of exemplifying the tasty hand pulled noodles store name. The broth was also quite tasty as well. The beef I wasn't that impressed with. It tasted a little old, like it had been sitting around for a while.  The dumplings were decent, but not the best I've had. I didn't think it quite measured up to the old Prosperity dumplings or the Vanessas dumplings in taste or crispiness.	4star
I walked in and was happily greeted by a man behind the bar, his name was Joseph. I'm Chinese and he's Italian but he really could pass for anyone's grandpa; he made me feel right at home. Seated in about 10 minutes on a Saturday night around 9 PM as larger groups were clearing out. I had the primavera pizza (12'' was really enough, 6 huge slices). Nicely-made thin crust pizza at a fair price. Prompt service, clean & classy place. Will be back!	4star
2.8 stars. A friend of mine who has too much time on his hands (much like myself), recently emailed me his review of an album he had been listening to. He gave each individual song on the album a score out of 5, and in summary used an aggregate mean to give the album an overall score. At the time I criticised his method, arguing that this take on numbers was too straightforward to capture the greatness of the music in question (we both agreed several of the tracks were brilliant and transcended such scales, a mere 5/5 did not do them justice). But I now understand what he was going through. He wanted to assign the album a higher score, but could not justify it to himself. In similar fashion my head is pulling me in the opposite direction for Caffe Grazie, telling me that somehow they deserve fewer stars, but it is not easy to justify how that is warranted: Setting & Ambiance: 2.5/5 - An attempt at somewhat upscale dining, in some ways glorious, but also a tad bit tacky. Atypical of UES I suppose, with an older crowd but a relaxed feel. FYI dinner price range is definitely more $$$ than $$, but pretty reasonable in this area. Service: 3/5 - Completely adequate. Bread & Appetizers: 3.5/5 - I love a good crust on some chewy bread, but I also really appreciate a restaurant that is not afraid to buck that trend and give me some really dense, but pillowy soft bread. The soft bread was delicious. The tomato and goat cheese dip with garlic toast was also very good. It was tangy and creamy, although I would have liked a bit more cheese. Main: 1/5 - I went with the lobster ravioli, and will start with the good. They delivered a sublime crab cake. Lightly breaded, but very crisp, with good chunks of crab meat adding great texture. It had a moist, deeply flavourful, soft consistency. Overall the dish was very rich, the flavours were there, and the tomatoes were juicy and fresh. But there was a fatal flaw, the ravioli was completely off. It was tough, and no I don't mean al dente. I mean it was doughy and gummy, ruining an otherwise well prepared dish. My friend's pumpkin ravioli on the other hand was fine according to him. So I would like to give them benefit of the doubt and leave it as a one-off failure, but I cannot get over how amateur it was. Dessert: 4/5 - S'mores with nutella and a base of toasted caramel cake-like crumbs. Heavenly! My other friend at our booth agreed, and I could not keep her spoon away from it. Aggregate mean was a respectable 2.8, a very serviceable meal, apart from one horrendous mistake that makes me strongly consider docking a star. They probably don't quite deserve that though.	3star
This Italian restaurant is amazing!! Had the Penne ara Biata, which had a very nice flavor. Can actually satisfy 2 people. Small proportions, but very heavy food. We also had Gnocchi. That was good, too. For dessert, we had the Tiramisu. Pretty big, but was one of the BEST I've had!! Nice calm environment, and very clean. All in all, great experience!	5star
I was not impressed. Service was slow, waiter didn't know anything about the beers on tap. Vegetable dumplings were gummy. Cobb salad had too-dry tasteless chicken breast and avocado that was starting to brown.	2star
The food taste wise, was good. Here's the problem. They forgot one of the meals which took another fifteen minutes to get. To top that off, they served us undercooked chicken, and cold Brussels sprouts. It took another fifteen minutes to get those back as well. Nothing was comped and no real apologies for the screwed up meals or the people and children left starving. Won't be back.	2star
"I guess make a reservation if you're coming here on a Saturday or Sunday for brunch. I got here around 10pm on a Sunday and the hostess said ""i closed the books"" like i know what that means... Basically they weren't seating anyone unless they had reservations. So the only choice was to stalk the people at the bar until they left so you could swoop in like a vulture and take their spot before someone else who was waiting tried to. Horrible! This place is tiny! Like everything else in New York. *rolls eyes* Soco is super cute from the brick interior to the bumping music playing(r&b/soul) it's dope. I had the chicken and red velvet waffles and a side of mac n cheese. My cousin got the wings. Now let me tell you about this mac n cheese. Sooooo goood!! Whoever made it, put their whole foot and elbow in it! Bomb! And the red velvet waffles best I've ever had! Now to the super dry chicken...y'all need to do better with that. I was SUPER disappointed. I was literally choking after each bite and had to chase it down with water.  Overall you get a B+ soco! Shouts out to Daniel who served us. Damnnnn Daniellll :) You da bomb"	3star
Good Lobster rolls. Average price of lobster rolls. I like the trio option to sample the shrimp and crab rolls. The lobster is the best one.	4star
"We came here in November of 2016, it was November 7th to be exact.  I know this because it was my birthday... We came here on my birthday about 2.5 hours before closing. It was our last day in NYC and we had been dying to get a fancy milkshake. We walk in notice a couple spots at the bar and were about to head there before being cut off by one of the employees, who explains that there is a line outside and we needed to wait.  What?! We just came in from outside and there wasn't a person in sight. We go outside and he leads us AROUND THE CORNER to a couple of stanchions, where another couple was waiting, he told us he would get us in ASAP. This was weird. Why is the line all the way around the corner??? My BF though maybe a celeb was in there at the time. I looked around when we were inside didn't notice any, but they can be unnoticeable at time, ya know because they are just normal people. BUT this is NYC celebs are everywhere, one of my best friends is a celeb and in NYC no one really cares, it's commonplace (no offense). Either way we waited, and waited, and waited. Mind you the couple in front of us was still waiting, and a few more people now behind us... after about 30-45min I wandered over near the door and looked in. 1. looking to see if they were guarding it for a celeb (at which time, fine we would just leave) and 2. to see about those 2 bar spots. The place is SMALL. No A-List celebs to be seen, and those two bar stools still open... I was standing there for less than a minute before the same employee came out and told me I couldn't stand in front of the restaurant. Fine, I started to go back to line but turned and asked him if those 2 empty bar stool were open seating. AND THATS WHEN THINGS GOT BAD. He turned around and YELLED in my face ""get the ""duck"" back in line, or no one is getting in"" ARE YOU SERIOUS!?!?!? I was literally blown away, speechless, motionless. I went back to the line and told my BF about the incident and it took a lot to get him to NOT get out of line and have a word with that guy. We were about to leave when we were like well, its literally too late to go anywhere else, lets stay here and wait to get in so we can talk to the owner/manger about the incident. We are about 2 hours into the wait (2 hours of empty stools, 2 hours of apparently no one leaving the restaurant - luckily we had some really cool line mates) when the SAME dude comes around the corner taking out the trash. My BF and one of our line mates (the same couple that arrived before us) asked about how long the wait was, and this time it was REALLY WEIRD. The guy walked up to our line mate and got about 2 inches from his face and said:  ""I'm gonna curse you mother*****, I'm a f***** witch, and now your cursed, go to h***""  WHAT THE ACTUAL F***!?!?!?!? We will not come to this establishment again, my friends (celeb included) and family will never come here nor rep their milkshakes on our Social Media Platforms or Blogs any longer. I have tried to contact this establishment about this employee with no prevail.  There are MANY options in NYC for a BOMB milkshake without being yelled at, disrespected, or CURSED, while you wait in line. Here are some suggestions: Buns Bar Momofuku Milk Bar Butter and Scotch Big Daddys"	1star
Impressive, large menu book but unfortunately some of the items featured were not available for dinner one time we went. I also asked the waitress which fruity drink is recommended and it ended up tasting like cough medicine. The frozen beer was quite the spectacle but had an average taste. The restaurant may be hard to find since the entrance is somewhat discreet. Once you go down the stairs, there is likely to be a long wait time and many people clustered by the bar and even blocking the way to the bathrooms. The average wait time was around 45 minutes to 1 hour. There are not that many seats available at the waiting area, so we walked around outside and came back (earlier than the time we were given). The hostess miscalculated the wait time and we had to wait an additional 20-30 minutes. The food was good but not the best in terms of flavor (and the sushi was not that fresh). The wooden tables were also uneven at certain parts and it made me nervous to place glasses on certain parts (where it would slope down). The seating was not that comfortable, especially after waiting a long time to be seated. We may try this place again to experience other parts of the menu!	3star
A hidden gem in Hell's Kitchen! Came here on Sunday at 5pm and the restaurant started filling up immediately after we sat down. It has a divey, hip vibe with old movies playing on the brick walls. The bar is situated in the middle with nice lights around it. The booths offer just the right amount of privacy.  I loved everything we ordered. You can't go wrong with the beets & bleu cheese salad. The lamb meatballs were delicious! Pita bread toasted perfectly and paired well with the tomato dip. Tried their green pasta and marinated shrimp and the creamy sauce is delicious. Best of all it was only $19, cheaper than pasta entrees at pure Italian restaurants. Would definitely return one night for cocktails!	5star
The yelp of this place looks phenomenal but let me share my experience in a few words. Incredibly long wait, ice cold hash and eggs, insufficient sides, overpriced. Disclaimer I did not get to try any desserts and that seems to be where the money is at maybe? I asked for for sauce or ranch and was given neither. It's as if my order was just sitting for an hour cooling down. I paid $30 for a mediocre breakfast that tasted canned. This place kind of ruined my mood lol	1star
I was staying around the corner on a recent business trip and was determined to have dinner at Scarpetta. We walked in sans reservation on a Monday night and were seated in the bar area immediately. We weren't starving, but did enjoy multiple rounds of the delicious bread and accompanying oils and tomato spread. My entree was the grilled branzino which was cooked perfectly and had the best onion and sunchoke combo paired with.   Food aside, the wine, service and ambiance were also top notch. If I'm ever back in Chelsea, I'll most definitely revisit Scarpetta for dinner.	5star
My friends and I came here on a Thursday night around 10pm and the place was pretty empty. I had had this $30 coupon for months and finally decided to use it. So this restaurant is actually on the first floor of a hotel. It's spacious with lots of fishing theme decoration.  The menu starts with raw bar, so the usuals, oysters, clams, crab legs... Appetizers, soup, salad, a couple of pasta. They also have a full bar and lots of cocktails. We started off with an Oyster Sample plate, which had 6 oysters. It was okay to me. I prefer the small ones. We had Grilled Clams, Shrimp Avocado Salad, and Mushroom Cream Soup. Grilled clams were fine. The salad was kinda weird and I don't like it. The soup was too oily. The Squid Ink Pasta with Seafood was odd and a bit sour. Overall I think the food was dissapointing.  The owner was really nice tho. But sadly I wouldn't come bank.  p/s: lots of clean, roomy restrooms for you ladies	2star
I'd tried Grimaldi's next door but had heard that Juliana's was way better, so needless to say, I was super stoked about trying out their pizza! We were in line waiting for a spot, but decided to just order take out instead so we could go enjoy our pizza on the pier. It was a super simple process, and the entire order took less than 15-20 minutes to be completed. Plus, you don't have to wait in line! You can just head inside to the counter, pick up and pay for your pizza, and be on your merry way! I'd definitely recommend this option if the weather is nice outside and you don't really care to dine in. I ordered a margherita pizza so I could do a direct comparison between Grimaldi's and Juliana's. Unfortunately, I found Juliana's version a little less flavorful and much less satisfying than Grimaldi's. No doubt the ingredients were just as fresh, but I felt like the pizza was lacking the oomph I had expected. Although I liked that the pizza tasted healthy and guilt-free, that's not really what I'm looking for in a cheesy, carby slice!  I'm definitely looking forward to a second go though, and next time I will be sure to order a pie that isn't as plain as a margherita pizza.	3star
I really just don't know how to express how much I love the bartenders. The crowded environment (due to being on TV), the bathroom situations (one for men and women), and how I was treated by a FEW guests when I was there wasn't my favorite part of this place.  Drinks are 16.00 bucks and tasty and its fun to watch the bartenders make. Its a great place to JUST do it. Its a great place to hang out, mingle, and bring people from out of town which is what I normally do. I've never eaten here because there are so many other places and I'm not really into reservations and from now on I highly recommend it.  when we arrived the security said he was told to shut it down after us, and then people still were coming in and people were living so that was a little weird. I was sitting next to four really annoying group who was soo loud I couldn't have a conversation. Overall not a fan.  Last time I was here was almost a year ago and we got a table, and the enviorment was welcoming and exciting and everyone was friendly and happy and this sunday night that wasn't the case at all.	3star
Location is very convenient near the highline, ambiance very cozy and friendly staff.  Food was great. Drinks recommended. 5 stars	5star
Good good, a bit overpriced, extremely loud environment when I went in there was just a crazy amount of people shoved in a tiny space could barely talk with my sister who was sitting 1ft infront of me . Definitely didn't feel very welcome the waiter just tries to get everyone in and out as fast as possible	3star
Amazing! Lives up to the hype. Definitely a must visit! The buns are a little pricey ($12 for 2) and not amazing, so those are a skip if you're on a budget. If not, then they're worth a try. I ordered the roasted pork shoulder ssam and it was absolutely amazing.	5star
I've been here twice and although the service is friendly, the food has always been disappointing, greasy and bland.  My flatbread appetizer was burned & oily - my soup was flavorless - and the tables are bare of any condiments.  I won't be going back - twice is enough.	2star
"The food is just ok. The yaki is not hot and burn enough. The hamachi kama is over cooked and dry. The service are terrible.  When we got home and reviewed the receipt, it printed "" 7% discount when pay in cash""., the server never mention that, and they did not give me any discount when I settle the bill with cash. I won't go there again."	1star
"I was pretty excited to try this place to be honest, but unfortunately, I didn't get to. Why am I reviewing then, you may ask? Well, because I needed to rate the service I received of this place because the business owner should know. Guests beware the staff is incredibly rude here, they are far from accommodating & the service is absolutely terrible.  I went to this place and tried to get a table for an app and some drinks. There were lots of open tables, but I was told that they were booked solid but that I could go to the bar. So I go to the bar and there were no seats or a place to stand. We decided to wait it out for about 10 mins and a standing room table opened. We took that table but never got any service. The manager came up to us and said he would look for some seats, but never returned. In the meantime, I found a seat stashed by the piano so I grabbed that to put under our table for our coats and such. Still never got any service at this point, and another waitress comes up and tells me that she had to take my chair. I asked why and they said they needed to use it for extra seating, would that be ok? I'm like I don't really have a choice do I? So she proceeded to take the chair, which made me super annoyed. Then our ""should have been waiter"" came up to us and said ""I was under the impression that you guys were going to go to the bar, but I guess I can be your waiter"". You guess? That's your job.  At that point, we had it and didn't want to give an establishment with these kind of incredibly rude employees our business. The best part is after walking out, I pulled up the Yelp app and they have tables available for reservations being booked within 2 mins. Absolutely ridiculous."	1star
"By far the worst management in New York City.  Our meals were going fine...good wine, good appetizers. Our entrees came and everyone got started.  About thirty seconds after the runner dropped off our food, our waiter came by with the obligatory ""how is everything?"" Now, no person with courtesy and common sense would say ""it's been half a minute since it landed on the table so I have no idea. Come back in ten and I should have my full review printed, double spaced with a bibliography in APA style."" No, we just said ""fine so far,"" because that's what normal people say. If there was an issue, of course we would let him know.  My brother ordered the Stuffed Lobster (market price $75). Nearly every part of the lobster (meat, claws, legs) was charred BLACK from their grille. Not just a little but heavy heavy char--so much so that I could smell it from across our booth. Needless to say, the meat, the stuffing, everything tasted heavily like charcoal and nothing tasted like lobster. My brother thought maybe it was his opinion so each of us at the table tried a bit to check. It was very clear that the dish was burnt and inedible. No one wants to eat something that tastes like you've licked a heavily used grille grate.  We politely let the waiter know, and the manager (Katie Dean) came over. Instead of apologizing, she proceeded to interrogate my brother as to why he didn't bring this up when the waiter initially came by to check on us, and insisted that was the way the dish was supposed to taste. To which my brother asked if there was a time limit on informing the waiter know that something was wrong. She pressed on with the fact that we already said everything was find, and was completely unapologetic and actually downright combative. She brought over one half of one deviled egg and a single tiny shrimp to compensate for the abortion of a $75 stuffed lobster dinner that was clearly intended for a very hungry person. If food was ever capable of being passive aggressive, it was last night.  Think about this. What if you were having dinner, and your waiter asks how everything is and of course you say fine? Right after he/she leaves, you find your chicken is uncooked in the center, or a bug in your salad, or that the bottom of the rest of your pork loin is burnt beyond repair--Has the statute of limitations passed? Is there even a statute of limitations?! What world are we living in?! Our waiter was great, very apologetic and took everything in stride. The manager (Katie Dean) is working in the wrong industry or the wrong position. She does not have the personality nor business acumen to face customers directly. Been here many times before, but we will not be back."	1star
The place is cozy and the pasta is good, but I don't think it's worth the hour plus wait if you don't have a reservation. The spaghetti with meatballs is pretty good (without meatballs it's a little bland) and the lasagna is delicious! But no one in our group of three liked the pizza. The crust is so thin that it cracks when you pick it up. The crust tastes more like a cracker...not my thing.	4star
The food is good, but the first time I went there we had to wait almost an hour and a half to get anything. For some reason they had some all-white jazz trio (very good musicians, just clashing themes IMO). The second time was a better experience -- not a bad wait. The injera could be a little less dry.	3star
Was super busy, so that meant long waits for (good) drinks, confusing staffing pattern that means only one person makes drinks although 2 people were behind the bar, no table service after 4pm, pricey, food was just okay. For the cost I would recommend seeking another venue. Cool atmosphere and maybe worth a visit when it's not busy but spend $ on food elsewhere.	2star
So disappointed.  I've had better food and better service for much cheaper than this!  We were made to wait 10 minutes and the inside was empty.  When we finally given a table it was all the way in the back by the stairs to the bathroom.  Our waitress made a comment to the other waitress that she was ready to go home and it was 7:30 pm on a Tuesday evening.  She was slow and at times we thought we could go in the back and make our food ourselves.  We were a party of six, not big at all.   The food was ok, can't even remember it all, something like a burger, fried chicken, salmon, shrimp and grits.  Collard greens were ok, mac an cheese, I've had better.  Cornbread ok.  I would take Amy Ruth's on 116th anytime!  Sylvia's in my opinion is Soul Food in a can.	2star
It's one of the most popular location in Chelsea market and we traveled all the way here just for the tacos. At first I got two tacos the grilled cactus (Nopal ) and the grilled chicken (Pollo Asado ). But the tacos are really small and I was not satisfied. The chicken one was good but didn't like the cactus one at all, maybe cuz it's acquired taste. So I decided to take the marinated pork taco (Adobada) and this one was the best among the three. I mean the tacos were good but they were not the best tacos I have ever had. Plus they were very small compared to the price. Maybe if I visit Chelsea market then I might eat here again but I would not travel all the way  again just for these tacos.	3star
This place is completely overrated. I'm waiting for the bill as I write this. Service was just ok. They wouldn't sub a different kind of meatball on the brunch dish I wanted. The wait for food was too long considering how rigid the menu is. I also found egg shells in my food. They comped my meal, which was the right thing to do, but I've had better meatballs from the frozen section at the grocery store.	1star
Very bad lunch experience. Server was unprofessional, Food was bad. took over 40 minutes to get our food while  only a few tables  dining. 2  stars for outdoor seating & ambience	2star
Food was simply delicious. Loved that the tasting menu was tailored for each table. Had a wonderful night of eating and drinking with friends.	5star
Buttery and delicious! They give a good amount of lobster. It's a good option if you're sick of ordering whole lobsters and having to peel them yourself. I think they have several food trucks at food fairs too.	4star
My typically late-working husband had off for Good Friday, and I get out of work at a decent hour everyday, so I suggested we take advantage of our early dinner opportunity to go some place buzzy. Upstate is definitely buzzy, quoting an hour wait at 5:45pm. As we waited just outside the doors, I overheard the wait time surpass the hour mark, and large parties turned away. If you do put your name in, they will text you when your table's ready. We were seated around 6:45pm in the cozy dining room. There are standard tables, a long bar, and some high tops, so it's anybody's guess where you'll be seated. We took advantage of the 6 oysters + drink for $12 happy hour deal, and added some Kumamotos. Great oysters, nice and fresh, and the happy hour oysters had a nice variety in sweetness and brininess. We also shared the bluefish ceviche, which was really good, and I love to eat local fish. I ordered the crowd pleasing fettuccine with clams, and that was delicious too. Overall, this is really good food at a really good value if you're in the mood for seafood and can get there early to wait for a table.	4star
When you walk in, you will pass through a cute little coffee shop. Don't worry, you are in the right place. We were lead to our seats, a nice private booth and I immediately noticed the lovely decor and ambiance.  For our appetizers, we chose the burrata and knots and the pickled shrimp toast. The knots were a bit too salty for my liking but the shrimp toast made quite an impression on me. I knew I had to order the fried chicken sandwich since everyone raves about it. The breading on the chicken wasn't that crispy but was rather a bit mushy. This is probably due to the cole slaw on top of it. I was also surprised to find that the sopressata was cut into very minuscule pieces and mixed into the cole slaw. You can barely taste it or even realize that there are any there. The only part worth mentioning is the spicy honey inside the sandwich. It went very well with the chicken. I also tried their 8 Oz hanger steak with herb butter. This dish was a bit small and also quite salty as well. However, the steak was very juicy inside.  If you need to use the restroom at any point, just a warning that it is quite a maze and a trek to get down there. You might get lost finding it like I did.	3star
And it's time to downgrade my previous review. I've now come to this restaurant 3 times, once for dinner on a Friday evening, once for drinks and dessert late on a Saturday night and once for lunch on a Monday afternoon. The service has been consistently terrible every time (though the server has been different each time).  The Monday afternoon lunch was the final straw. The restaurant was fairly empty with maybe a handful of other patrons around. There was a hostess, a waitress and a bartender none of which paid much attention to my husband and I. The waitress disappeared at some point and didn't return so I guess her shift was over. After quite a bit of time the bartender took our order. I ordered the crack soup which gives you the option of chicken broth or spicy broth and choice of meat. I had ordered regular chicken broth with no meat.  A ridiculous amount of time passed. My husband got his burger. No new people came into the restaurant. Some more time passed. I finally got my soup. It was with spicy broth and chicken. Two things wrong with this simple order! Another 5-7 minutes passed before I could get the attention of the bartender. His back was always turned to the room. Maybe he was printing receipts on the computer or something but that's just poor placement of the computer then. Check up on your tables once in awhile! I finally got his attention and told him what was wrong with the order. He seemed just as annoyed with the kitchen as I was and took the soup back. Another ridiculous amount of time passed. My husband was long done with his lunch. I finally got my soup and ate it. This is the most disappointing part about this restaurant. I actually like their food! We got the check and noticed that my $2 tea was comped. That's a nice gesture but unfortunately not enough to compensate for the 2 hour long lunch which should have taken maybe 40 minutes. I can't imagine how frustrated I would have been with the experience had I actually had to go somewhere after lunch, like back to work! Three strikes and you're out. Sorry Bijan, wish you were better.	1star
Highly overrated in my opinion. I brought a friend here and talked it up so much based on the Yelp reviews and was pretty embarrassed afterwards. The soup dumplings are not bad here, but I've tasted ding tai fung and it hands down has this place completely beat. In terms of other establishments in the vicinity, Shanghai Cafe had better soup dumplings in my opinion.  Their dumplings here was a good bang for your dollar, but the meat didn't seem tightly packed together so had this sort of crumbly texture like it was shredding apart when I was eating it. Plus the soup had an odd sweet flavour note to it which I feel did not go well with the meat. I'm more of a salty and savoury kind of girl. Not tragic but seriously overhyped, there's a better option so close by! Would never return here for that reason.	2star
"No thank you.    I came here for restaurant week. We had a reservation  and went straight to our seats. Unfortunately they placed us at a table with seats that we could not sit at  because they were so close to the next table. The wait staff didn't even notice this because they had just put down the menu and walked away. We had to call someone to ask another table to move a bit so that we could sit down. We had to request the Restaurant Week menu. When it came to order the octopus, scallops for appetizer. We had the roasted chicken and lamb chops for dinner. We ended with the baklava and chocolate cake for dessert. Everything was very good. Chocolate cake was great except it came with half a scoop of ice cream which looks like someone had already taken a bite from. Baklava was way way too sweet  (and I know its supposed to be sweet...) Biggest issue was lack of attentiveness bus stop. In fact when I asked for the restroom one of the male staff members(dark hair tall male working upstairs)  tried to make a joke stating we have one ""across the street and down the block. Just kidding!"" What the hell? When he realized that  I was offended he said ""oh no, they're downstairs."" I don't think that the staff was a good reflection of this quality restaurant. It is very unfortunate."	1star
Went for a birthday dinner and the food was delicious, filling, and well priced. Extensive menu and comments below:  Caprese salad-perfect amount of salt Tripe- wow! Never had tripe served that way before. The sauce is warm and comforting and the bread perfectly charred.  Grilled octopus- tastes good but wasn't particularly amazed by it.  Sweet potato lune- so simple yet flavorful. It was more of a sweet treat at dinner Chianti Stained pappardelle- very hearty, I found myself returning to this dish the most in between bites of the other dishes Homemade orecchiette- also another hearty dish and easy to eat with the small pasta compared to to the Ragu dish.  Black spaghetti- simple, nice and light if you don't want a heavy red sauce.  Lamb chops- love me some lamb. Good portion of food with great presentation.  Barbecued skirt steak- wow!! Beautiful presentation and so juicy. This was definitely a favorite. I think the eggplant was the perfect balance for a heavenly  red meat.  Sides-  large serving if beets. Endives were alright.  Dessert- coconut cheesecake was superb! Toasted flakes couldn't be beat. The panna cotta was also good but we preferred the coconut dessert.  Music was a bit loud. They were playing the red hot chili peppers album but the music selection got better as the night progressed.  Would definitely return! Staff, wine, and food were all great!	5star
This review is not for the food at Thai Market. I actually like the food and was looking forward to eating there. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to... My husband and I were walking in the neighborhood and wanted to eat outside. It was the middle of the day on Sunday. I went inside to ask the host for a table. She asked if there were two for inside. I corrected her and said we wanted to dine outside. She looked at me (7 months pregnant but at a healthy weight. I still weigh less than my husband and most men) and she said that she didn't think the chair would hold me. I couldn't believe it! This is the most offensive thing that I have been told since being pregnant. Just completely rude, untrue, and demoralizing.  I won't be going back again while pregnant. Servers and hosts should display a little more tact and empathy.	1star
Got the grossest pizza and it was $20. Fake ass reviews and awful restaurant. Also got charged 3 bucks for Parmesan cheese w my pizza	1star
3 stars all goes to the pho. i have ordered thr Saigon special and it is the best Pho I have ever had in the city. The grilled pork Vietnam sandwich is just ok however.  Generally speaking the food is not bad at all. However, the receptionist lady is extremely rude. There were couple tables available and we asked if we could switch and she ignored us. We asked again and she gave me this ugly look and talked rude and claimed that table was for 3 ppl but not 2. We saw that particular table had only 2 chairs and a couple just left from there in front of us. If she decided to give out that table to another party of 3 but not us it's totally fine but talked to us nicely. Deducted a star here due to this for such kind of service.  I am going to try this again next time and see if that's just one coincident event that she's having a bad day. Will post again and keep you guys updated.	3star
"We sat at a high table in the bar area and ordered dinner. The waitress brought glasses of tap water which tasted vaguely metallic. My dinner companions said that it tasted like the dish detergent hadn't been fully rinsed off the glasses. I've eaten in restaurants all over New York City and have never had water that tasted so horrible. We asked for bottled water but, after pouring into glasses, it stunk! Our waitress couldn't have cared less. Another problem: A restaurant with no napkins? Our food arrived and we had utensils but no napkins. We flagged down our waitress and eventually she gave us each one small 4"" x 4"" cocktail napkin telling us that there were no more dinner size napkins available. Huh? Our food was only mildly acceptable. I had a duck dinner that was under cooked, almost raw. Again our waitress was unresponsive. This was a terrible evening."	1star
I have been all over the world trying scallops of the highest order (I long for that tender, buttery taste) and Upstate has the best scallops I have ever had in my life. When I was a child, mother let me try the wonders of the scallop one afternoon and ever since then I have sought the apex of scallops. I have found that taste at Upstate. Their happy hour oysters and beer is great, too.	5star
This is a very fun place for a gathering.  Pretty interesting concept you walk through a pawn shop and then go into a very large room.  The food was good and interesting but the reason I gave it a three was because of the service.  Also, I think this would be a great venue for a office party or special occasion.	3star
Second time coming here. Worth the trip out of the city. Beautiful views in the park outside to walk off your yummy pizza. Classic margarita with pepperoni	5star
I had the short rib taco and an orange/lime juice.  It was a single corn taco that was good.  Juice was ok.  But they only take credit/debit cards and the cashier turns the iPad towards you and your choices are NO TIP, 15% Tip, 20% Tip 25% Tip, and maybe some other higher choices.  Since I was two feet away from the cashier I wimped out and picked 15%.  Total for the order was $17.84.  I felt ripped off.  If forcing you to tip the cashier is going to be the trend, I'm not going to participate.	1star
If you're looking for drinks and small bites before a show or work in the area this is a good place to go. Basic bar food. Extensive drink menu. Service was suffice. The place gets super packed and is crazy loud. Not really my thing so I probably won't be back but it wasn't a bad experience.	3star
Delicious food & excellent service! Our group of 7 was very happy with all of our appetizers, main courses, and desserts. My chicken was very nicely done, and I absolutely loved Pavlova for dessert. The wines were also great.   Now I am looking forward to visiting Amélie in SF.	5star
Came by for lunch because of the high reviews and was a bit disappointed. I've heard that Brazilian restaurants are known for there melt in your mouth steaks but the one I ordered was extremely tough to eat. I ordered the Bitoque which I found to be difficult to eat and overly salty. Bummer. On a positive note, the sides were very good. We ordered the fried plantains and grilled asparagus. The plantains were awesome and I would highly recommend them. Pass on the grilled asparagus - nothing special. So here's my recommendation - if you're going to try this joint, make sure your steak isn't ordered for medium rare (which is a general favorite for many steak-eaters). Mostly likely medium to medium well would work best for the cut of meat. Tell them to go light on the salt in the Bitoque and order the fried plantains!	3star
Bartender was nice...but kind of oblivious. Food service slow. Then delivered my meal to someone else who then chowed down on it. It is NYC, a lot of better places near WTC than Suspenders.	2star
You can't ignore the signs. When something is Michelin rated as many times as this place, you'd be silly not to drop in whilst visiting Flushing.  This was our last stop on Dump Tour 2017 and I was feeling full. But that did not stop me... I went for the spicy pepper and beef soup noodle and the pork soup dumplings. They bigger than your average dumpling, and the all the flavors that come out of that sweet sweet bun are a winning combination.  In my opinion these buns are up there with the best. Top 3 easily!!! The spicy pepper and beef noodle soup was also pretty delicious. Could have done with some more vegetable as it was literally pepper and beef but beside that, an enjoyable dish.  This spot is deffo worth the wait if there is a queue. If you're a fan of soup dumplings you will not be disappointed!	5star
In the mood for some short ribs and my god they are amazing hear the brisket was pretty awesome but not my favorite-deafly coming back here over and over and over again	5star
Got the opportunity to be one of the first to try this new BBQ hangout in flushing during the soft opening.  Quality meat selection and cook it yourself at your own pace.  Every bite is hot off the grill the way it should be.   I'll be coming back when they open officially; be sure to try the garlic shrimp and the kalbi.	4star
Went to Jane for brunch on a Sunday.  The menu is a bit limited.  I ordered the salmon benedict which was good.  My friend ordered the crab cake (Jane) Benedict and she loved her dish.  I ordered the pastry basket and the scones could use some work.  We did get complimentary cocktails.  Those peach bellinis were wonderful.	3star
Oh Baby...Who Suggested this place to me?  Rolled over here after some city explorations on the upper west side. I was told by multiple people to check this place out since some claimed the xia long bao was better than Din Tai Fung, so why not put the hype to the test?  Met here with some friends from in town and got 5 XLBs 2 pork and crab and 3 pork. We got the garlic green beans, some jumbo prawn dish, and some noodle dish.  We'll cut to the chase. Everyone comes here for the XLB , the rest of the items on the menu were pretty Meh, but the XLB was probably the most decent thing we had. I'll say compared to Din Tai Fung these are about double the size which in turn give you double the soup. DTF would fill the bottom part of the soup spoon while Joes fills the entire spoon with soup. I'll say though that i prefer the soup from the DTF XLB rather than joes since it actually has a nice flavor and not gelatinous. The dumplings themselves are a lot thicker than DTFs, so they're super filling. The Pork tasted alright, but the pork/crab had a fishy aftertaste. I've had the pork/crab at dtf and it didnt really have any aftertaste .  To be fair our friends did say that Joes is franchised and the one in manhattan is notoriously known to be the lesser of joes, and that the Flushing location is the OG and tastes way better, so the next time we're all in town we'll be checking out the Flushing location.  If you're in Manhattan skip out on Joes here, and go to the one in flushing as recommended by our local friends.	2star
Went to Whitman & Bloom a few weeks ago for a quick dinner with a friend before going out. I had heard good things about it, but hadn't had a chance to visit. It didn't look busy so we decided to check it out. We first walk in and see the hostess. The restaurant seems pretty empty so we didn't think it would be an issue getting a table. She then tells us that a majority of the tables are actually reserved (we assumed for reservations) and asked us if we would be willing to sit at this communal table in the back. We said ok as we didn't believe it would get busy or other people would get sat with us. When the hostess walked us back to our table, there was at least 10 empty tables available. In the back area where we were sitting the entire section was basically empty.  We placed our orders, my friend had a tuna burger and I had a regular burger. My friend seemed to enjoy her burger, but mine was just ok. I didn't love the way it was cooked and the ketchup they have is AWFUL. I hate when restaurants need to try and be fancy by using ketchup other than Heinz. Realistically everyone in America likes Hinez if they like ketchup... why not serve that? If you don't like the way the bottle looks then put it in a dish? Maybe I'm the only person annoyed by this, but that's something really makes or breaks my meal.  More than half way through our meal, the entire restaurant is still pretty empty and another set of 2 walk in without a reservation as well. They are sat at our communal table. This communal table is meant for 6, so theres 2 seats in between our dinners, but there's still at least 10 tables in the restaurant open. Even they made a comment to us about how strange it was that we had to sit at this little table when there was plenty of available seating. Also, have to mention that this table we were sat at was lower to the ground with pretty uncomfortable seats.  Overall I was really not impressed with Whitman & Bloom. I've heard good things about brunch, but not sure I'd even want to go back.	2star
Disclaimer: My rating for Five Senses has nothing to do with the food because there is a reason I keep coming back here. The 3 stars is simply for the service because I find it to be consistently bad. If the food was not as good as it is, I would probably not have come back. That being said - yes. EVERYTHING is good here. Pa Jeon - perfectly crispy, delicious flavor, the kimchi is not too overpowering.  The fry on their fried foods is beautiful in general. Perfectly crispy, not too heavy, good.  Their kimchi stew was just the right burn of spiciness with the pork belly flavor kind of rounding it out - it's an amazing dish for wintertime.  Don't even get me started on their bulgogi - they know their meat let's just put it that way. End of story.  Long story short, food is great, service is consistently bad.	3star
I don't care who or where you are; if you have good seafood, I'll be at your doorstep very very soon.  Upstate drew us in with their reps and hit the nail on the head.  We ordered oysters to start, she got the Fettuccine with clams, and I got the Cioppino. Our oyster selections consisted of the Stony Brook and the Wild Rocky Point.  What complex algorithm and experiences did we utilize to pick these specific oysters?  Absolutely none.  It just further emphasizes that you can throw darts blindfolded at this oyster menu and still end up with rock star oysters.  They were all super plump, exploding with juices, and of course, delicious.  Nothing less. The cioppino was one of my rare excellent decisions.  The broth was seasoned perfectly, not overly salty at all.  The seafood in this dish featured a wide range, so quantity was on point.  The fish was flaky and tender, and all the shellfish were sizable.  That bowl was cleaned. One offense is clams with little meat.  Don't worry about that in the Fettuccine with clams.  A picture is worth a thousand words, so just go look at pictures of their clams and decide for yourself.  The sauce isn't heavy at all so each bite retains all the flavor from the clams. Also, complimentary whiskey cake at the end.  So delicious! Our dishes were perfectly cooked, great quantity, and at a relatively cheap price for what you're getting.  Get it while it's hot!	5star
"Got half a. Rack of ribs, not bad..but a very sweet Bbq sauce. Try all the other sauces on the side, those are well made, xxx is the spicy one that went great with the ribs.  Nice outdoor setting to enjoy a good meal and beer. The ""unicorn"" drink was tasty as well, but I prefer to have a beer with ribs instead."	3star
"My experience: food was SPECTACULAR, service was not--especially for a one-star Michelin restaurant. The food alone is what keeps this review afloat. I have to admit, I share my sentiments with other Yelpers who gave Gotham two or three stars.  The bad: Our waitress was unfortunately not up to par. I sympathize that she had to cover a lot of tables, was courteous and professional..but my sister and I couldn't help but feel neglected throughout our meal. It got to a point where we had to ask the servers and busboys for our waitress. The tables between us shared the same issue. While I hate being rushed out at restaurants, it also should not take 30 minutes for customers to receive their check (Insert Frye meme of ""SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY"").  Furthermore, there seemed to be either a lack of training or communication of the staff in general. When the servers gave us our food and dessert, they just plopped them down in front of us with nary an explanation; very perfunctory.  Now the good: Holy macaroni, the food was amazing. My sister took the seafood route, while I was on a meat kick. My mezze rigatoni was the best starter ever, a heavenly combination of mozzarella and lamb shreds and the right amount of cream. The seafood salad was probably the best bang for your buck out of the options with the amount of lobster, shrimp, scallops, octupus, and squid. Worth it if you're a seafood lover.   I had the Long Island Duck Breast, and my sister had the Dover sole, which was cooked perfectly. The duck breast had an interesting combination with mustard and mango chutney. The foie gras was cooked to perfection: fatty and translucent without being gross. My sister enjoyed her Dover sole, which was grilled well and the sides complemented the fish nicely. I recommend both dishes.  With two orders per person, we were quite full and glad we started small. Otherwise, I would've needed someone to roll me home.   Verdict: Glad I went, had great food, but service left a lot to be desired. Probably won't be back unless I feel like blowing a hole through my bank account."	3star
"Tried this as a family of three on an outing to NY Botanical Gardens. Since it's summer and reviews looked generally positive, we tried Johhny's.  We read reviews about people enjoying ""throwing food at seagulls"", which made us hesitant--not only because that is a destructive thing to do to those animals, but because it's just plain gross. At one point during our lunch my husband watched an ADULT throw a container of fries into the WATER to feed them. So there's the littering too. It bewilders me how people act.  As for the food, the shrimp, scallops and fish were all fresh and cooked well. The fries were very greasy, so skipped those.  Cheap, simple seafood and large portions help explain why this is such a popular spot.  But the cacophony of gulls and the foolish people who think feeding them is entertaining is just plain disturbing--made my stomach churn."	2star
Not very good. Didn't like the fried rice. And the greens were bitter. Poorly done American 'asian'.	2star
The staff is so nice and the food is always fresh. Really feels like European cuisine. I love their salads and sandwiches. And the truffle oil is delicious!	5star
Please is very inviting and the staff is wonderful and very helpful.  You can try some of the best chorizo and cheese that is important from Spain here.  In the front is the market and they have a kitchen as well. My review is mainly for the sandwhich it was good.  Nothing out of the ordinary and you can really taste the spices in the chorizo which was a bit cold in the middle but charred on the outside. The service is fast and the staff helps with good recommendations.  Grab a glass of wine as well. I am not a fan of wine but I would say it was good.	4star
"I finally went to this spot after drooling over the pics for ages lol I read about the long waits and rolled up there with my son determined. We only waited about 15 minutes so was not oo bad. The bartender/server was very friendly and cool. The hostess was like a bodyguard not letting anyone cut the line lol. This place has a spunky cool unique feel to it. Everyone gets their own big monstrous bottle of water with a little glass cup, so that people do not have to keep asking for water refills with is very smart since it was one bartender/server helping everyone by herself.  The ambiance itself is not great or impressive. It is a very simple bar set up style place with little kid tight seating lol (Little elbow Room) The music selection was pretty interesting with lots of rap from Biggie to Lauren Hill and Snoop dog....... so I was in there jamming. I got a pizza burger, with a turkey patty, and french fries. It was good and tasted solid a little above average and the pizza sauce gave it that extra pop I wanted with the cheese. Was this one of the best burgers I ever had ??  No.... but like I said it was an above average burger and tasted good. The french fries were very good. My son got The Californian with fries. He also got a Crazy Shake ""Sweet N Salty"" Peanut Butter Shake; he told me it was amazing and I can confirm it because I had some to taste it. The shake was everything and lived up to the hype most definitely. The Chocolate Pretzel And Chocolate Drizzle Combo WOW!  Its a solid 3 stars in my opinion. If I am going to pay 20 dollars for a burger and fries it better be mind blowing lol both were a little above average at best. $15.00 for a milkshake smh but I get it you cant get this tricked out milkshake on steroids just anywhere. I would say go just for one time experience. The cost and wait to get in vs quality of product ratio is a little crazy and lopsided in a negative direction but still happy to scratch this place off my list of burger joints."	3star
Visited this place twice in one week! Once for dinner and another time for happy hour. You can make open table reservations and get a chance to spin the wheel ( one per table). Also checking into the yelp app allows you a free spin. I was so close to getting a bottle of Soju, but instead landed on a jar of pickles. It wasn't on the menu and it ended up being a mason jar filled with pickled vegetables.  Shared the TUY and the seafood pancake. The TUF was truffles, on top of uni which was on top of beef tartrate. It tasted pretty good all together in one bite. The pears that garnished the side went well too. The seafood pancake was crispy and quite large. I shared the uni bibimbap and it was really good. Each bite had me biting into salmon roe.  The happy hour specials are from 4-7pm and do not allow reservations. I went on a Sunday afternoon and was seated right away near the bar area. The oysters are $1 each and require a 6 oyster minimum per order. The BJ wings in soy garlic tasted just like MFC or Bonchon wings. The crispy asparagus were dipped and fried in one end with panko and sesame seeds. Only downside to happy hour is that they do not let you spin the wheel. For the drinks, the peachy lycee and lavender honey are my favorite as they are light and sweet. The thyme grapefruit soju is a little stronger and it is on the prize wheel!	4star
Kill me, but i think the place is over rated---at least the shakes are. The shake itself is basic chocolate/vanilla ice cream--nothing special about it. what makes it interesting is all the bells and whistles they put in it or on top. to be honest its a bit too much, and coming from a sweet tooth lover, thats kinda scary. its fun and cool to have once, but i wouldnt make this plaec a regular thing. especially since i think they are way over priced. i feel they look prettier than they taste. I love love love the music thats playing in here, and the service is fast. yes even with a line, the servers here will hustle and find a seat open for you. bathrooms are private, but a little sketch. if the top part of the restaurant looks packed, dont worry theres a whole bottom floor.	2star
Quite standard Korean food. Expensive (~16) for bibimbab. Simple, tasty. Biggest pro is that is open super late (6am) therefore you can have a place to hangout for a long time.	3star
Good food, small restaurant, good service. French onion soup was really good.  But the restaurant was much smaller than expected. Food was more casual than I expected. Food quality was good, though.	3star
Both very blan I have taste better thai food not really to seasons don't believe the hype at all I am being very honest not good at all	1star
If oysters is what you desire for, this is definitely the place. Happy hours is 1/2 dozen oysters and beer of your liking. 3 choices for Happy Hours oysters: Fin de la Bai: Canada  St. Simon: Prince Edward Island Naked Cowboy: Long Island The Naked Cowboy was definitely my favorite. With so many varieties, I had to try other non happy hours oysters. The Shigoku is definitely a must.	5star
I got a Gilt City voucher for this place and finally get around to use this weekend. I've been calling since Friday and no one ever picked up. Wrote them an e-mail and never got a reply. Finally today(Saturday), we drove all the way from CT to this place around 4:40PM to found it closed(when it is stated on FB and Yelp as being open). I waited for another 30 minutes and still closed. There's no notice on the door either. Horrible experience.	1star
I tried this place a few weeks after it opened. I was excited, but I went in with reasonable hopes (ie. the bar was not set extremely high). The decoration itself was pleasant. The ambiance was average, but I'd somewhat welcoming. I believe I went on a Saturday night, and also as a reminder, it was when the restaurant newly opened, so I recall it being quite rowdy. However, I do not blame the restaurant for this, nor would I extrapolate that it is always like this, but wanted to call this out incase it is something you want to consider. So.. on to the food. NO. That's all I have to say. Let's focus on the 2 food items that are in this restaurant's name. First - the gyoza I did not try, so defer to someone else's review. Second - the ramen. What a huge disappointment. The soup was not flavorful, but really quite salty. Instead it was way too thick - I am talking a consistency that maybe is a bit more liquidy than corn chowder or lobster bisque. If you're able to get over the flavor and the texture, you might be able to try to appreciate the actual noodles or the rest of the ingredients. But I could not. I had a hard time trying to enjoy this at all.  IF I ever go back again, I will definitely stay away from the ramen, but really at that point it almost makes more sense to go somewhere else.	1star
Casual brunch place in Brooklyn. The place is beautiful, filled with plants and indoor lighting. I think the food menu is a hit or miss - wasn't a fan of the oyster platter or omelette, but the smoked salmon crostini was meaty and delicious! Also loved the huge potato wedges.  For drinks, no to the bloody Mary mimosa! Yes to the cucumber specialty and hibiscus & tequila. Service was awesome.	4star
i came here with a group of 9 for an early birthday dinner. we winged it without a reso, so i was surprised they were able to accommodate our group right away. fortunately i think our 5:30 dine time helped us out as there was a long wait when we left.  i enjoyed the overall ambiance of this place, it was full of natural light with a crisp cozy feel. we started out with the hummus and mixed platters along with 2 orders of falafel for the table to share. we did have to ask for some more pita as the first round of pita didnt have enough to give everyone their own piece. the hummus was very tasty along with the tabouli salad.  for entrees people got a mix of the stews and grill options. i found the basmati rice and cous-cous to be cooked perfectly and very flavorful. for the lamb grill they asked for temps, but everything seemed to come out medium. overall the protein was flavored nicely. the grill entrees leaned toward the pricier side when you consider how basic it really is.  service here could use some improvement. our waitress was unattentive and missed out on the opportunity to jack up her auto gratuity by failing to keep the alcohol flowing, oh well her loss.	3star
Cute little hole in the wall right in gravesend. We had the sweet chicken curry and it was good. One thing I like about the dish is that the portion was lit and affordable. The chicken was tender and the curry sauce was lightly spicy and flavorful.  We also ordered a bit of sushi. I'm going to cut to the chase. It was awful. It is by far the worst sushi I've ever had. It was on par with gas station sushi. This is definitely the worst sushi I have been served in the gravesend Bensonhurst bath beach area. The rice was old and gray and hard. The salmon was gray too. And the taste was not even there. I guess I'm the fool because who goes to a Burmese place and orders sushi. I honestly should've explained that part of the bill should have been reduced. This was literally the worst food I've ever been served and paid for. In short, come here for the affordable Burmese food. Skip the sushi at all cost.	2star
This is a cool place, with a cool vibe. I ordered a lamb sandwich, that came with an au ju.  It was dry, and lacked flavor.  I would not reorder. Our server was inattentive, and spent most of his time talking to the bartender. We did see a manager during our visit, but he could have been served better training his servers to be attentive.	2star
"BASURA! GARBAGE!! SHITTY QUALYITY CUSTOMER SERVICE AND FOOD!!!  My sister gave this as a Groupon to me and my husband (I'm kinda offended that she did right now). Needless to say, it deserved ZERO stars. The prices are outrageous, the food is mediocre and tasteless. I ordered a pineapple and chicken fried rice and it was tasteless, the chicken was black (not burnt, just black) and to top it off it was $14 for a tiny bowl of rice! I spoke to the waitress about how unpleased i was and she still charged us for the rice we threw out and told us ""thats just how we makr it"".My husband ordered the rib eye steak and it was tough and very chewy. It was $74 because it was server over a fire pit... the Groupon was $30 for $60 worth of food... the food wasn't even worth the $30, but costed us an extra $62 (steak, rice, steak fries (also garbage), 2 kani salads (were decent) and a beer) for a grand total of $121... Save your money for a place with good food and less/no disappointment. I'M LITERALLY NAUSEOUS THINKING ABOUT THE FOOD WE JUST ""ATE"" (more like threw in the garbage). Staff was not attentive and not helpful. In the pan of  2 hours she did not come to our table and only came by because I raised my hand for the check...  I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH DON'T WAIST YOUR TIME AND MONEY HERE! Simply disappointing."	1star
The Tuck Room is a cool/hip restaurant and bar in Fulton but the service needs improvement.  My wife and I visit the Bethesda, MD iPic and attached restaurant (City Perch) often and while we were in NYC, we decided to visit the iPic and The Tuck Room.  Upon walking in, you are instantly in awe of the murals and paintings on the walls.  It's a very dark space but it has unique lighting and it has a cool/hip lounge feel.  We decided to sit at the bar but there was limited seating still available at the bar so we had to sit in front of the ice chipping station.  The ice chipping station at the bar is the spot that the bartenders chip the ice to make large cubes for those who want an ice square in their drinks to limit the melting ice in their drink.  It has a large clear glass to protect the customers on the other side, but unfortunately, when the bartenders chipped the ice, it would still go all over the place and on our plates on the bar-top.   We were at first greeted by a great guy (I forgot his name) and he instantly got our drinks ready (Cabernet and Moscow Mule).  The Moscow Mule wasn't too bad, and my wife's wine was fine.  We ordered a Shrimp Cocktail and a Farmers Market Pizza.  Both food items were brought over quickly and were both very tasty.  Again, the ice chipping station and glass got in the way of dropping over items.  All of the sudden, the bartender we first started with disappeared.  I'm guessing his shift was over because he was no where to be found.  We were then stuck with a bartender who didn't really care about us at all.  A young woman (I believe maybe was a manager) came by and asked if we needed drinks and I said yes, but she ultimately forgot about us and carried on with whatever else she was doing.  We had some friend visit us at the bar and it took a long time to get the bartenders attention and it wasn't that busy since it was a Sunday evening.  We did one more drink at the bar and then we left to go to our movie.  Again, it took awhile to get the attention of someone so I could pay my bill.   Overall, the food was very good and the place has a good feel, but since the service wasn't anything great, there are probably better options within the city.  If I'm visiting NYC again, I'm not sure I will personally visit again.	3star
1) best location ever. Leave yourself a little time to walk by the waterfront. 2) great service from host to waitress to sommelier. Although they were out of the wine I ordered, the sommelier came out with a suggestion that ended up being super tasty. 3) good meals and great dessert. Highly recommend the homemade pasta with rock shrimp.  Perfect spot for a romantic dinner. Will definitely be coming back!	5star
Had to change my review of this place... I had originally thought it was such a cute spot and brought my boyfriend back...  The cook must've been in a foul mood because he was very attitudey, I wanted to get my two favorite things -'pickled veggie plate and crab Rangoon - the cook muttered under his breath that they were out of those things; Ended up sharing a few things instead - pork schnitzel sandwich, oyster club and fish tacos - all were pretty lackluster, pork was served on a plain white hamburger bun  I still maintain that  1. the bartender is nice 2. They have a good selection of beers 3. The backyard patio is very cute Bottom line: come here for drinks but not food	2star
I love all the food here. My go-to dinner is: hamachi, spaghetti, and panna cotta. I believe they finish the spaghetti in buttah. The duck and foie gras ravioli is also delicious.  The RW week menu makes this really affordable. With the poor service and long waits (despite making a reservation, I've waited for +45min), I wouldn't take a group here.	3star
AMAZING RAMEN. long wait but so worth it!!! Try to go off peak hours or expect a decent wait time. Pork buns are DROOL WORTHY	5star
"Just came here and was so disappointed. I've been coming here for years and now, they have changed their food's flavor profile to mostly sweet and salty. No spiciness whatsoever when we order something specifically called ""spicy squid noodles."" Thai food is supposed to be spicy.  Also, multiple bowls of rice and their fried rice was cooked totally wrong. It was hard and disgusting."	2star
This place has about 20 seats, give or take. There are a few seats in front of the bar/kitchen and the remaining seats are at a long community table. You will be sitting elbow to elbow when it gets crowded. Items are a bit on the pricier side and portions for the appetizers are small. Don't forget the cash!!!! They don't accept cards.	3star
"Four of us went last night, they were out of one of the main ingredient on their ""special"", it was late so I'll give them that 1. the waffles weren't crispy or anything special. The chicken was ok, I mean your advertising chicken and waffles. It was moist but the batter so so. The biscuits were hard, they were out if cornbread. Oh can't forget the collards, no taste, no turkey necks, no ham hocks....how can they even be called greens?? Sorry not a fan"	1star
Xi'an Famous Foods must have a different definition of famous, because i've never even heard of this place until recently. This D-List celebrity churns out small hits in the spicy cumin lamb burger. However their earning power lies in their hand-ripped noodles. Whether you're mingling with spicy cumin lamb or spicy & tingly beef, it's sure to leave you seeing stars.	3star
People say cozy but what they mean is the place is the size of a medium-sized bedroom and this includes the bar. There's like 3 tables and then 1 table outside and bar seating which is uncomfortable because you're bound to feel people brushing past you everytime they pass.  There's no helping it. It's that tight. A friend and I got there and I felt claustrophobic so we  ended up leaving to go somewhere else which I was disappointed by because the reviews are good.	2star
I made the mistake of coming here starving and underdressed. This place is beautiful and gives off a sophisticated and romantic vibe which makes it perfect for a first date. It's dimly lit, and the music was great. There's comfortable leather seating and small tables, so you may be sitting very close to the next patron. I came in with another hungry friend (who I have no romantic feelings for) so hopefully the couple next to us didn't hear our conversation.  My friend had steak over toast and I had crispy rock shrimp. Remember when I said I made the mistake of coming here starving? Our food was nothing more than a small appetizer. We really enjoyed it, though. Can't complain about the drinks either. They're reasonably priced and get the job done. While our server was nice and personable, I just wish the service was better.  We waited fifteen minutes for our server to take our drink orders, and over ten minutes for our food order. I can honestly say we barely saw her. For the size of the place, I think I saw only two or three servers. It was a busy Saturday night, and I understand that shit happens, but it was obvious that they were understaffed. Had we received more prompt service, we would've ordered more drinks, but we gave up as soon as we glanced over at the bar and noticed the overwhelming amount of people that were standing up against each other with little to no standing room drinking and socializing. Despite all of that, I'd definitely be open to coming back on a night during the week, or even for brunch.	3star
I ordered fisherman's chirashi. 3 pieces of fish. Really bad salty eel. No flavor in rice. Appetizer size. Really disappointed.	1star
"The waitresses were okay; the boss had a terrible, terrible attitude. We were told to leave after an hour because she claims that we've been sitting there for 2 hours.  When we got there, we were forced to order almost immediately because they were very ""busy"". The food came almost 30 minutes later; wow, I wonder why we had to sit and eat for another 30 minutes. (That was sarcasm if you haven't noticed).  The food wasn't terrible, but it wasn't all that good.  I don't think a restaurant business is merely just about its food, it's also about the service. Therefore, I give this place 1 star, if I could.. No star."	1star
Came here on a friday night with some family and ordered family style. A lot of their stuff is very hit or miss, and their drinks are very watered down. In my opinion, I think their menu is too extensive. Too much to look at. It is also on the expensive side, especially for Chinese food. The lighting isn't great, on the dark side. The waiters are kind of spacey. They took our order and someone else came later and asked if we were ready to order. And on a friday night, the business looked really slow. We had ordered the crispy eel, lions head meatball, turnip cake, curry over crispy rice, duck eggs rice cakes, fried rice, taro puffs, and some sticky rice dessert. The crispy eel was decently crispy. The meatball was standard, probably not hard to make. The rice cakes were nasty. The texture was just grainy and the taste was too eggy/yolky. Taro puffs were just like the turnip puffs - totally not worth it. They were small and tasteless. The sticky rice dessert was surprisingly not bad for what it had looked like. Overall, the place is just meh. Ended up spending way to much money on subpar food.	2star
"Root and Bone captures a southern charm that seems natural.   Howdy y'all. Quick country lesson for yankees -  Howdy is a conjugation of ""How do you do."" From ""how do?"" Ps We're doin' just fine. I took a bite of a fried chicken drumstick and said ""Are these guys from the south?"". It was a rhetorical question because one bite of that easy lovely crust took me to a back yard in Fort Worth at my grandma's house.   I went a little crazy and slurped down a few jack Daniels with house made ginger sours faster than you could say jack rabbit stew. This place feels like home with hardwoods, cottage decor and a gentle kind staff that all exudes a friendly warmth. I ate three drumsticks, and some shrimp and grits that felt Tennessee, Mississippi or Georgia.  Being a Texas boy, my standards were high, and they were surely met, easily sating some home sickness.   If you're from Dallas, this place is alot like Sissy's, and if you're from Austin, it's like Luann's, but better.  The place isn't fancy, and it shouldn't be, but the dim lights make for a cozy date or a longer meal with good friends.   Get the fiddle out and jam.  I recommend ordering alot of food and just call it a big ole cheat day.  I did. Atmosphere - country cottage lands in alphabet city. Food - unpretentious stick to your ribs country cookin''. Thanks y'all."	5star
Came in and ordered the veggie burger which came with a side salad. We then also ordered a side of fries ($6). The patty was crumbly and dry. I couldn't even pick up the burger without it completely falling apart with crumbles falling everywhere. It didn't really taste like anything...it was almost like eating really dry bread sandwiched in between two other pieces of slightly stale bread. Maybe people don't really order the veggie burgers here so it gets dry in the fridge? That was the feeling I got. The dressing on the salad was good. The side of fries were really disappointing for the price. They were tiny, little pieces that had to be eaten with a fork. Almost like the crumbs at the bottom of the barrel. And the serving was super small.  The ambience was cute, so maaaaybe I'd come back for a glass of wine. The service was ok, not great.  Also, It's cash only even though they bring the bill in an American Express thing.	2star
I went with a party of six on what was my second time here.   It was Friday and there was a 30 minute wait which became an hour, which is fine.  I can understand how backed up a trendy place like this can get.  By the time we sat,  we were approached with hardly a greeting by a server in her early 20's.  No problem.   So I decided to order something close to the theme of the place. I went with the Seafood Jambalaya thinking, how could they screw a staple like this up? They did.  1st, It took way, way too long for our food to arrive.  To give you an idea how long, half of the tables were cleared out by the time we were served. 2nd, before we actually got our food, the server stood in the corner texting which is fine, but she just didn't didn't keep an eye on our drinks at all nor did she have a friendly and approachable personality.  This kind of sickened me. 3rd, By the time I got my dish, the rice was way over-salted, but honestly, the worst thing was that every mussel I had was tiny, dried up and every piece of shellfish was way overcooked.  Where was the quality control?  Freaking ridiculous. As a sidenote,  I had not eaten all day and was with my friends, so although I should have, I didn't return the dish.  I just wound up eating half of it.  After my second time here, i've developed an opinion that it's just another place that sells it's theme and decor rather than the Cajun cuisine it's putting itself out there to replicate.  I honestly cringe thinking of the experience and i'll probably never return there again.	1star
I was never really a Vietnamese Sandwich person because the shops I tried in Chinatown have dry hard bread that cuts your mouth and dry meat  that makes you choke. But this place makes me rethink my dislike for these sandwiches. This place has the best Vietnamese sandwiches!   I tried the Monster Joju, Pork Belly sandwich, and Kimchi Fries. The  Monster Joju didn't taste anything out of the ordinary, pretty plain. But, big but, it still tasted much, MUCH better than the ones I've had in Chinatown. The Pork Belly sandwich was the best Vietnamese sandwich I've tried in my entire life! The Kimchi Fries.... I didn't know that french fries could taste any better than it already does. Must try the pork belly sandwich and Kimchi Fries!	5star
Restaurant week lunch: the inside is fantastic! I loved the decor. I came with a big group of almost ten people, so we got a big booth spot upstairs where it's much less busy, but still lively during prime time. Had salmon tartar which was great, seafood pasta, and ice cream for dessert. The server was so nice and put up with me changing my mind multiple times as I ordered because the options were all good. The pasta wasn't that incredible, and actually dare I say it was average, but the overall atmosphere, service, and rather large portions made up for it.	4star
Food was wonderful, location and people were wonderful, would have gotten 5 stars, but ranked as a 1 star because they did not allow lap tops. Do not go here if you want to relax and catch up on your lap top over breakfast.	1star
Don't know how this place got 4 stars? Everything is sickeningly sweet from salad to pad see ew. Salad is doused in half a bowl of sauce, yikes. The pad see ew is the worst, very hard to swallow.	2star
Pros: - Came here for the enticing Happy Hour Special (Cocktails $9, Soju $13, Cocktail Soju $18, $9 Wine, Draft Pints $2 off, Draft Pitchers $5 off, and discounted entrees, M-F 5:30pm - 8:00pm) - Easy to make a reservation through  . They called me the next day to confirm - Good for big groups, tables sit 6 people comfortably Cons: - 2 stars for absolutely awful service and mediocre food. On a Friday evening, the place was only half full and yet the service was basically nonexistent. We kept having to flag the staff for attention. After waiting abnormally long periods of time did they inform us that they forgot to submit my friend's drink order and then later the Calamari. All drinks and food took for-e-ver to come. When we complained to the staff, they didn't apologize or provide any goodwill gesture to make up for their incompetence.  - While the thinly sliced fried sweet potato with sprinkles was a different and interesting take from the standard fries, the novelty soon wore off and we wish we got real fries instead. The calamari was over-fried with no taste of the squid inside. The only OK dish was the Sweet and Sour Vegetable Dumplings. How did this place get 4 stars? Beats me.	2star
Absolutely delicious! They have the best xiao long bo in the city. Crab or pork, you can't go wrong. Wait times have gotten a lot worse since tourist have found this to be head and shoulders better than the tourist-trap down the block. The stir fry udon and rice cakes, meatballs, shredded chicken and scallion pan cakes are among my favorites here. They only take cash or Amex (No MC, Visa or Discover).	4star
Came to this place for a late Friday night dinner date. Notably, the place is very small, so we had to wait for an hour to be seated. I actually really like how small the venue is because it makes the eating experience a much more intimate one. As if you're having a meal with your big family on a big table. During the wait, the hostess was very attentive to our needs and even served us drinks, which was really nice. We eventually got seated at the bar, right in front of the kitchen. We got our orders quickly, and the food really did not disappoint. I think the only thing I didn't like about the whole experience is the price points for the menu items. Other than that, I'm pretty sure I'll be going back to this place, and telling people to check it out as well.	4star
Eh, the waitress was horrible; she was rude, inattentive, and did not know how to split a check (when we all ordered separately). The drinks we ordered from the menu were disgusting (Willy Wonka and Passion something).	1star
Came here for an early birthday lunch with some friends. Made reservations for a group of 7 that came with the ssam group pork shoulder thing. Appetizers we had duck and waffles, duck dumplings and broccolini. Then came the pork shoulder with the lettuce wraps, kim-chee and oysters for the table. Duck and waffles and the dumplings were amazing. REALLY good. I want to come back just for those. The broccolini with the panchetta was good. The pork shoulder for the table was huge. It says it can feed 6-10 people... we had 7 with some heavy eaters and it was more than enough. I made it a mission to not leave with any leftovers and went full fatass mode. The pork shoulder was very tender and tasty. Overall awesome food. Service was good. Coming back.	5star
You would never suspect that a place in chinatown would make a bomb ass burger. Well I tell you what, this place does it right. Made fresh to order you are presented with a fantastically stacked burger. Not to mention the myriad of hot sauce you can put on it. Oh! The hot sauce, they have plenty of it... they have pretty much a museum display of it. Never have I seen a restaurant with such a wide array of hot sauce. Lined all over this hole in the wall is hot sauces from all different walks of life. Just coming here over and over to try hot sauce is enough.  But they do more! Once again the burger is fantastic,  and the tater tots. Don't get me started on those loaded tater tots. Is this place healthy? I doubt it, don't come here on a diet. Maybe it can fit your macros though =) Side note-They also have a perty good mint drink.	5star
The best food in Little Italy's neighborhood!! Service is great; Alfonso is very accommodating and sat our party of 5 in the main dining room.  Antonio's is our destination for authentic Italian dining.	5star
Dumpling are still 5/5 and conditions are better. They reorganized the prep area and the way they serve. Do expect a communication challenges, greasy dirty tables, and sharing of tables.	4star
Well. 8pm on a Thursday and no coq a vin or duck confit, if that gives you any indication of how the night went . The coffee machine didn't work. They couldn't make  3 of the like 7 cocktails. And the restaurant was empty. I'm at least 87% sure the rest of the reviews on this sucker are fake because the restaurant was not great....to say the least. The only redeeming quality was the company, which has more to do with my friends than it does with the restaurant. Is it possible to give zero stars on Yelp?	1star
"We went to the restaurant on Thanksgiving for their prix-fix menu. We were very disappointed...  Let me begin by saying that we are a big fan of Union Square Hospitality Group restaurants. We like Danny Meyer a lot and love The Modern, Gramercy Tavern, Marta - these are some of our favorites in the city. So we had no hesitation in trying Maialino for Thanksgiving (our first time there).  Overall - the restaurant was very crowded by the number of diners; the servers seemed overwhelmed and therefore did not deliver service level a restaurant of its level represents; the menu/food was quite weak serving soup as appetizers and the main course was quite mediocre, very plain; there were many tables of 6-8, which made the restaurant feels like the Italian restaurant chain - Maggiano.   Food - First course was ""stracciatella soup"" (i.e. turkey egg drop soup) for Maialino Classic Menu and cream of chestnut for the Italian American menu... come on, that is quite lame for Thanksgiving feast starters; Second course was spaghetti and parmesan for Classic and butternut squash ravioli for Italian American, the spaghetti was terrible and banal, but the ravioli was actually amazing; Third course was suckling pig (their signature dish) for Classic and Turkey breast and polenta and stuffings for Italian American. The suckling pig was most disappointing, the meat was so dry I had to spit it out after my first bite; the turkey was good, but again not anything spectacular.  Atmosphere - the restaurant is known for its intimate and warm setting, but that ambience was pretty absent when you had a room full of tables with 6-8 guests one next to another with kids screaming and running around. It felt very crowded and not classy at all. Service - ever since we sat down, we had 3 different wait staff telling us they will be taking care of us tonight. We ordered a bottle of wine and they kept the bottle away from the table, we finished our meal and were served desert and coffee, we had to ask the server if the bottle was finished and came to realize that there was still at least one and a half glass of wine left, which would have been thrown out if we didn't ask.   Our check totaled $400 at the end, and we really felt no value was delivered! I surely hope that on a regular night, the restaurant delivers the USHG experience they are know for..."	2star
"Success is a Bitch! Roberta's is so successful, doing so much business selling pizza's and the such, to hordes of people willing to wait hours just to get a taste of what they got, and in the time it takes to get that ""Little Slice of Heaven"", being treated so badly that it could actually shock an old buzzard like me, and I'm pretty unshockable {sic}. I mean, I'll wait for food. That's not an issue. Sometimes it worth it and sometimes it's not. That's the luck of the draw. I get it. But to be told at 7:00 you have a 90 minute wait and after 60 minutes you go check and see how you are doing, and then told you still have a 90 minute wait that's not too cool. And, to be told in such a scolding, harsh, ugly way that you either take the reality of this BS or get the hell out.......... Please? Really? Me?  Not that I'm anything special, cuz I'm not; but some young millennial talking to a guy in his 60's who has been around the block a few times, I found it disgraceful, unsettling and down right contemptible.  The only other person to ever talk to me that way was my ex-wife, and she probably had a good reason. I didn't know this Prissy Little Twit, so it was just plain mean spirited and for no good reason.  Only a place this successful or that stupid could pull off that kind of uncalled behavior toward a patron. The one take away I came out with last night is, The Roberta's Group is not even slightly stupid. That just leaves, successful.  Like my opening line of this review says - Success is a Bitch!"	1star
As a patron who has been coming to this restaurant since it opened, I have to say my most recent visit was incredibly disappointing. Not sure if there's a new chef, but something is off. We waited 30 minutes for a table, which is normal. Grabbed a few drinks at the bar while we waited. The margaritas were by far the best part of the experience. After being seated, we were not greeted by a server and sat looking aimlessly around for a good 20 minutes. We eventually ordered the Guac, Salsa, and Chips. Both didn't not taste AT ALL like they used to. The Guac tasted sour and the salsa was way too tangy.  My boyfriend ordered three tacos -- the special (spicy pork), the Cali, and the Long Beach All Star. The only one worth mentioning was the special. I ordered the Sunset Pork and the Cali. Both taste and presentation were off. I've spoken such high praises for this establishment but between the bad service and the poorly tasting food, I regret to say I will not be returning. It's a shame that this local restaurant has gone down hill. It really was one of my favorites.	2star
This place is legit! Hometown BBQ looks like a small warehouse with a large indoor open space with 2 sections for dining. I came here during Labor Day afternoon and to my surprise, I only had to wait about 20 minutes. I ordered the brisket, spare ribs and Korean sticky ribs. My favorite were the spare ribs that were perfectly tender, smoky and slid right off the bone, and the Korean ribs that was drenched in a delicious garlic sauce and scallions. The brisket was alright, I thought some of the meat was too lean/dry, and was missing some flavors. I also had the cornbread, which was good but had a slight plastic aftertaste. I had a margarita ($12) from the bar and it was really strong! I really enjoyed the atmosphere, it was really laid back and I was able to eat, drink and hang out without feeling rushed. It was mostly self-served as well.  I want to come back to try other other meats on the menu, I saw them make the brisket sandwich and it looked massive and juicy AF.	4star
"Root &a Bone is such a delightful ""take"" on Southern cuisine. The menu is packed with many dishes and all  look amazing-it was difficult to choose a few. My daughter and I stopped in for an early evening meal. We sat outside on a cool summer evening and started with a glass of Rosé and lemonade. For appetizers we ordered the warm cornbread with bacon maple butter (it was as yummy as it sounds) and the drunken deviled eggs(beautiful presentation). Dinner dishes were Local Tomato Salad and Peaches 'n Burrata. The tomatoes were seasonally ripe and fresh along with cucumbers and red onions. We enjoyed the peaches too, although we prefer the cooked peaches to be a little softer. Dessert was my favorite-but isn't is always? We shared a ""mini"" banana pudding and I'm very lucky it was a mini because I could have easily eaten a large one! Attentive service and charming decor. Luckily, Root 'N Bone is just a few doors down from my daughter's new apartment. We will be back!"	5star
"The food was delicious. Appetizers (scallion pancake and cold seafood salad) were excellent. The mushroom/cheese spread on rye bread was alright. The rainbow trout, chicken rotisserie, and burger are great.  The disappointment is in the service. We were a party of 5 adults and one toddler. They counted us as six and included a 20% gratuity even though we ordered 5 main dishes and 3 appetizers. And of course as expected the service that followed sucked. We asked for water twice, the plates were slapped onto the table without an apology for the abrupt interruption, a lady just dived right in onto our table to light the candle without saying ""excuse me"".  Not once did we get asked ""do you need anything else.""  A thirty dollar gratuity when earned doesn't bother us at all. However for this level of service I guess the tip has to be included since it would come nowhere near that had it been a choice."	3star
So, let me start by saying, I was really looking forward to eating here, I've been a Batali fan since the 90s! Maybe my expectations were just too high. The staff was friendly and attentive. We started with the caprese salads and it was very good. Fresh and ripe heirloom tomatoes and creamy mozzarella. We all had different entrees. I had tuna in a gazpacho sauce. The tuna was fresh and well cooked but overall just fell flat, nothing special. Another had the gorgonzola ravioli. She ate one and was done due to the overwhelming flavor of the fennel. Our birthday girl splurged on the  $75 truffle pasta. Again, the dish fell flat, definitely not worth the price tag. They did give our friend a complimentary dessert, an olive oil cake that she enjoyed.  To add to the disappointment, while you're having your expensive, mediocre meal, they're blasting hard rock music. We had the AC/DC Hell's Bells album. Strange, right? Unfortunately, I would not recommend this place and I certainly wouldn't dine here again, too many options in NYC.	3star
This is not a review about the food or service* My boyfriend and I came on a cold Sunday night from Brooklyn (an hour commute) to only find out once we arrived that they were closed all night for an event! There were other people surprised just like us too.  Their website and yelp did not mention any announcement about the event.. we were disappointed about this. Please update your social media for people!	1star
I was given a recommendation to go here by a friend and she told me to make a reservation a month in advance. So I did! I barely was able to get a table at a normal hour even with booking so early. Really good date spot and place to celebrate. Atmosphere is intimate and dark. Actually it's kinda hard to read the menu and I have good eyes. Service was impeccable. No complaints there. Ridiculous wine and drink menu. Think they have wines from around the globe. If you are a wine-o this is the place for you. Food wise, definitely a yummy meal but expensive. The cheese plates to start off where a great idea and actually pretty well priced. Can't go wrong with any of the pasta dishes but I will say my favorite dish was the pork chop. Really big portion and the price was only 28. No way one person could finish it. We got the olive oil cake (like everyone recommends) and I see why. Really tasty. We also got a chocolate based dessert..forgot the name but that was also lovely. Can't go wrong ordering here, but if you are looking to eat and drink then it will ring up to a pretty penny.	4star
New bar near my office. Looks really good. Service was great and the staff was warm and welcoming and friendly.  We went here just for drinks.. Did not really enjoy them so much. We got an Oktoberfest and Stella and both beers were really flat.. We changed it to a Brooklyn lager, same thing... Really flat beer..	3star
Very nice atmosphere. Busy but not noisy and friendly and efficient staff. The food is refined and delicious and I highly recommend the cheeses instead of dessert. Service is already included which is a nice touch, I think.	5star
We came in for a pretty late dinner so the notorious line wasn't as long as usual which was nice! We ordered the pork soup dumpling as well as the pork & crab soup dumpling and they were both extremely tasty!! Soup was very flavorful, but the skin was a little thick.  We also got the eggplant in szechuan sauce and the string beans sauteed with garlic and pork. Although they were both tasty, I must say that the vegetables were rather soggy and extremely oily. While I would give it a 5 for flavor, it's not the place to get fresh vegetables!  Finally, we got the twice cooked pork! Again, flavor was good but it was extremely oily and they gave us much more cabbages than actual pork which was kind of a downer.  Overall very satisfied with the food, it's definitely a place to go in NYC!	4star
Great place for chicken and waffles!! Try the bacon and cheddar waffles -- I absolutely love the little bacon bits inside. The waffles with the assorted butters and their maple syrup is the PERFECT combo. Plus I love that their chicken is thickly breaded and super savory.  I've tried the sweetchick at the LES location and I have to say that I enjoyed the LES sweetchick better just because of the wider space and more seating. This Brooklyn location tastes just as great, but is a little cramped. If you're coming with a big group, then I would recommend the LES Sweetchick.	4star
I think this bar is the PERFECT place to bring a date on a Saturday night. It wasn't crowded at all around midnight, we stayed until 2am, and you can have a conversation without being bumped into or screaming. My girl friend and I quickly realized this, since there were at least 5 couples out in the back area. First, the bartender was wonderful. We asked if we could see a cocktail menu, and right away he said that he could whip us up something based on what we were in the mood for. He made us a STRONG rum based cocktail with watermelon and it was delicious. For $12 a piece, it was worth it! This is coming from 2 girls who drink too much and too often.  The back patio was perfect and calming. Plenty of tables, lanterns, and it was just a cozy feeling. While I was there at night I couldn't see the pond, but I think there is a pond somewhere too. The inside has a beautiful aquarium and plenty of tables too (just look at the pictures). The bar was very clean and gave off a great vibe. *Ps. You can order food when you first walk in, had my friend and I known, we would have gone here for dinner! 5/5 I'll be back for food and drinks.	5star
I was really really hoping The Breakroom would live up to the hype. What's not to love about tacos + burgers + fries under the same roof? I'm sad to report this is just another underwhelming spot with overinflated Yelp reviews.  The good: 1. The tempura fish taco is pretty tasty and they don't skimp on the avocado.  2. Their milk tea is seriously refreshing on a hot day.  3. Very little wait for our food, yay!  The Bad:  1. At almost $4 a taco I'm expecting some double tortilla action. Not a flimsy flour tortilla. And what's up with those tiny lime wedges?  2. All of my tacos were covered in pico de gallo, which I'm a fan of, but I felt like it took away from the individual flavors of each.  3. Don't order their cheesesteak. After living in Philly for 5 years, I was pretty pumped to see whiz in a NYC dive spot. What we got was a three day old bread and whiz cheese sandwich with a bite or two of steak. If you're gonna skimp on the meat, make sure the bread is fresh. I gotta admit I expected a bit more out of a spot with 4 1/2 stars and almost 1,200 reviews.	3star
The chicken is good, but the service is pretty horrible and not worth it anymore. They don't deliver or take pick up orders. Thus you end up standing for who knows how long...20-45 min... waiting for chicken. They don't even put hot sauce in the bag anymore. A lot of friends have stopped going because it's not worth the wait when there are so many other Peruvian rotisserie chicken places around with better service. (pm me for names). I won't be back here again.	1star
Update: New review due to last visit with friends. We waited 75 minutes for our appetizers and then decided to leave. As we were getting up one of the four appetizers came out. We said no thank you! Hostesses are really lost and it's quite hilarious! Our waiter was wonderful. The kitchen has major issues. Originally when I first heard the same owners as Baluchi's were opening this place I was very skeptical. Now I know I was right to be concerned. I mean this place can't even handle being open all day yet and they are closed on Sundays!! Really, you can't handle brunch?! This is why I've changed my five-star review to a two-star review.  Got here at 6pm for the soft-opening. The menu, ambience and vibe of this place is just what this part of our neighborhood needs. Obviously, things need to be worked on (hello, first night they were open) but all staff members were very nice. I'm sure in a month Queens Bully will work out their tweaks and become a gathering place for locals and transients.	2star
This is the best soul food spot! It is very authentic and I just love it. The employees work very fast and always cater to your needs. I've been here several times and i have nothing bad to say. They always have a line out the door. I wish the place was bigger but that's about it.	5star
Best Chinese food Ive ever had! I was very lucky and came on a day that they weren't super busy. Only took me 5 min to be seated, but be aware wait time cane be high. They do turn people in and out quickly but not in a rude rushed way. The soupy dumplings are a must and both are to die for and apparently as legit as it gets without having to travel across the globe. I also tried staple items as the sesame chicken and main, the best, as well ad the crispy duck, and chicken in plum sauce. This is a place liked by locals and tourists alike which always a food sign. The prices are standard aprox 15-20 per plate.	5star
"Came back to Tanner Smiths for a second time this week to celebrate a birthday because we enjoyed our first visit so much. The food and drinks are both great. All with an interesting ""Tanner Smith"" twist. I love a  good Moscow Mule and the SingSing is Tanners version- really interesting taste profile with cherry cordial and balsamic. We ended up ""table sharing"" fish and chips, pork tacos and duck quesadillas. So good! Cheese curds are a MUST. Ashley and Emma were fantastic and took such good care of us. They quickly made us feel comfortable and welcome and were able to suggest items and drinks we might like. The only reason for 4 stars - the upstairs is SO loud in the bar area. We were downstairs so we were able to talk with no problem. We'll come back to Tanners on our next visit. Thanks, Denise"	4star
Honestly I don't want to s__t on a neighborhood go-to.  At first, we were told it would be nearly 30 minutes. That is totally fine. We opted for a beer at Franklin nearby. Please note we were not offered the option of getting a drink in the restaurant.They texted to say our table was ready. We were two minutes away and abandoned our drinks to dine. Then we got there and the table wasn't ready for another 10 mins. Could have finished our drinks. But, I get it, timing is not always perfect.  The slaw is bad. I'm just saying it. It's like heat with no flavors. The bartender was congenial. The drinks were tiny. At first I thought oh hey these are decently-priced drinks. Expect 4-5oz. They're well-made but tiny. The jerk chicken leaves something to be desired. The chicken is juicy but the flavors are amped by the side sauce. Not bad, but not what you're after if you want jerk chicken. Bok choy is delicious but who messes up bok choy. We didn't request to-go bags.  TL;DR: If you want great food, go elsewhere.	2star
This place is horrible...my wife and her friends went to dinner last night and got ripped off... Food was horrible...David there server is a low life...there bill was 88 dollars and they decided to split 31 for my wife. 31 for her friend and 26 in cash for there 3rd friend. My wife left him 6 dollar tip for a total of 37 bucks. She checked her credit card and was charged for 57 dollars instead. Her other friend was charged 88 bucks by the low life david.  When they called back later that night, the restaurant claimed there manager wasn't in and rudely hung up.  Avoid this place at all cost. They are a frauds totally disgusted by this place and the people they hire.	1star
This excitingly small restaurant popped up near me and every time I passed it, it was always crowded. Naturally, I had to try it and see what all the commotion was about. The first time I went in, I was so curious I stood looking at the menu for a good 10 minutes before embarrassingly leaving due to the lack of cash in my wallet. Their menu covers the entire left wall with pictures and labels with the level of spice and vegetarian options. As I waited for my first dish, I noticed a man in the back of the kitchen making noodles! They actually make their own noodles in this no less than 650 square foot restaurant. You can get it to go or to stay, but it is self serve so no tip is needed. However, even if it was, the food is so cheap to begin with. I went twice, and would have had change with a $10 bill both times. The aroma is fantastic, the colors are intense, and the flavors are bold. Come up to 102nd and Broadway and try it out.	4star
It's been a while since I've led myself to any type of fine dining restaurant (or whatever the hell this was), and Maialino just reminded of why I don't go to these places anymore. I recently listened to a few podcasts and interviews with Danny Meyer about how his restaurants are turning to the non-tipping model and, as a someone who used to work in the restaurant industry, I was super excited to support this change. Maialino was not the first non-tipping restaurant I'd been to and this was also not the first time I'd been to Maialino. I'd come here about a year ago with a girlfriend and enjoyed the food and experience very much and had been meaning to come back here. What prevented me from coming back sooner was that everything was at least 30-40% more expensive than it was less than a year ago, but I had to remind myself that I was supporting a good thing. In the interviews and podcasts, Danny Meyer urges his guests to think about it this way: You are supporting fair wages, and you should elect to go to these restaurants because they practice sustainability and serve quality ingredients. But then I come to my own realization, I am paying $86 for lunch - for an appetizer, two pasta dishes, and awful service. At some point, it occurred to me that the table next to us had finished their food and was ordering dessert, and we had finished our appetizer when they were seated. So where the hell was our food?  We had to wait a while to flag someone down, and they said it was going to come out in five minutes.  At that point, it had been maybe 30 minutes since we finished our appetizer, and when my boyfriend tried to flag someone down for attention after waiting another 10 minutes, the waiter looked at him and ignored him.  We were beyond irritated.  They'd forgotten our order!  They didn't even have the courtesy to acknowledge us, apologize, or explain to us what happened.  But no matter, it's not like their tip depends on it. I'm sorry, but if I wanted to support fair wages and eat from a place that cares about sustainability, I'd have gone to SWEET GREEN where their employees probably make more than the cooks in the kitchen back here AND provide better service than the wait staff here. And trust me, my salad would have tasted just as good, if not better than, the pasta I had here.  Fine dining used to be a place where you could go out, get treated well, and have a great meal and have a good time.  Now it's just a place for you to throw out all your money to be treated like you're an annoyance to your servers.  I mean, my waiter at PJ Clarke last week was 10x better than these clowns here.  If you're going to pass off the costs of this model to the customer, then have the decency to make it worth our time by training your staff on what customer service is.	2star
This place was absolutely amazing the first time my girlfriend and i came here. But the second time the food wasn't good at all. I ordered the steak and potatoes,  My steak was burnt to a crisp and had a burnt taste to it. The potatoes aka fries were drowned in gravy, which made it soggy. Did not enjoy the food as much as the first time. My girlfriend ordered the chicken burger which was as bland as my personality. But other than that the drink selection and drinks are great, the service is good and the vibe and look of the place is awesome.	3star
Really good lobster rolls & chowder. For the Dumbo location take the east river ferry and walk over. Obviously it's a beautiful spot to eat outside or walk around anywhere along there	4star
The owners have spent a lot of $$, unless they get a chef who focuses on authentic Mexican seasonal food they won't make it. I am not going to dissect the food because it's new and I spoke to a very nice waitress who will hopefully pass my comments on. I want this place to succeed and improve as I live 2 blocks away. Ideas. Authentic food!! Make it and they will come!  Homemade sauces, hot sauce etc Corn tortillas  Smaller seasonal menu Get a real Mexican drinks menu and recipes - Paloma's, get rid of the slushy machine.	3star
Great place to come for thai food. Ordered drunken noodles, curry chicken, beef soup, chicken skewers, and others. They were all delish and fresh. This place is def. worth it!	4star
"I had high expectations going into this restaurant but I find other ramen places to be better. The ramen was pretty average so I wasn't ""wowed"" by it. It was also too salty and chewy in my opinion. They give sparingly few toppings. The miso ramen I got comes with enoki mushroom and it was the smallest piece of enoki I've ever seen. However, I got the brussel sprouts and the tots as well. The brussel sprouts were really good and the tots were coated in okonomiyaki sauce which was surprisingly a really good combination. The service was also really good; the staff was really friendly."	3star
Huge fan here. My favorite neighborhood restaurant. Drinks and food are always amazingly good. Cash only, which I think makes it a bit more reasonably priced. Even the brunch fare is awesome. In the heart of trendy DUMBO with lots of great retail close by.	4star
First of I love the location it's so nice and quiet I would say 5-10 minute walk from train station into dumbo. The pizza was super good and fresh I also enjoyed how the space wasn't huge so it felt pretty intimate. It was also nice to see the huge pizza brick oven. I really enjoyed the pizza we got I can't recall the name but it had argula and ham. The other pizza specials looked really good so can't wait to go back and try more!!	5star
Authentic and unpretentious Filipino food is hard to find in the city, so I was so excited to hear that the former chef at Cafe 81 was now at Ugly Kitchen. So we decided to grab a late night meal on my boyfriend's birthday which turned out to be a terrible idea despite this place's 4 star rating.  In short-disappointing experience Service-slow and inattentive. The staff seemed put out by having to seat a group of 6 even though there were only 4 other diners. A drink was missing from our order, which took 20 minutes to arrive. By the time the waitress brought the missing beer, we had already finished our meals. Food-disappointing. Ordered sisig and pork barbecue, staples on every Filipino menu and usually a safe choice. The sisig was dry and bland and the BBQ was rubbery. Both dishes came out lukewarm and the presentation of the sisig looked like a side of corned beef hash you get in a diner.  Ambience-at 10:00 it's more like a club and LOUD, awkward for stuffing your face. It's a small place too, so no way to divide the diners from the partiers	2star
I came into this restaurant hoping for some good pasta and I ordered Carbonara. However, the pasta was dry and the flavor wasn't compelling. It was hard to finish the extremely small portion they gave us due to the overwhelming taste. Though the other pastas may be good, this pasta was not the best, considering it's very expensive price.	1star
By far - the best Malaysian restaurant I have been to! Authentic, and delicious. We ordered way too much food - but finished it all - because it was just that good. Here are the dishes you must start with since I did all the hard work for you; feel free build upon this base (you welcome.) Roti Canai (at least 1 order per 2 people) Hainan chicken (my favorite) Beef Rendang (no one does it better)  Prawn Mee  Kang Kung Belacan (sautéed convolvulus - I know this vegetable sounds weird but you do need your greens, and I promise - this is good for you) Coconut rice  As with other restaurants, all members of group must be present to get seated. With that said, enjoy!	5star
Cozy place, the tables are a bit too small to fit everything on them, food was not really exciting.. come here for wine not for food	2star
With so many BBQ spots popping up throughout the boroughs, it's nice to see one pop up in a hoppin' area of Astoria. It's definitely easier for me to get out to that part of the city than Williamsburg or Red Hook, that's for sure.  We went on a Saturday evening for my beau's little bro's birthday. Arriving around 8:15 p.m., we were given a 15 minute wait, but about three minutes later, we were called right back in, a table ready. We were given menus, but had a hard time deciding with so many wonderful choices. Eventually, they went for the Philly Cheesesteak and the Monster, respectively. I went the lighter route...relatively speaking...and ordered a 1/4 pound of brisket (a la carte), plus a side of mac and cheese and a side of the green salad. I got to steal a bite of each of their sandwiches, and both were so delicious; they melted in my mouth. My mac and cheese was absolutely on point. My salad was crisp and the ranch dressing was perfect. The beau ordered some of their cornbread with honey butter, and I could have eaten his entire basket of it! Wow! I suppose the item I liked the least was my brisket! Go figure. I didn't hate it, but I found it to be a little on the dry and flavorless side, though their excellent BBQ sauce did help. I was a little bit bummed, admittedly. The Philly Cheesesteak had brisket on it, and *that* brisket was much better than my brisket.  Also, I kind of wish I got a drink that night, because the guys ordered the Hard Pink Lemonade and the Full Moon Rising, and DAMN. They were both delicious and potent. *phew* It's fine. I enjoyed my icy glass of water. Haha!  Though I was a tad bummed about my bite of brisket, this is a really awesome BBQ spot! I look forward to coming here again and trying some more items on the menu, and I'd certainly give the brisket another shot. Next time, I'll definitely be getting a cocktail (or two!), too.	3star
"I haven't been to DUMBO to hang out in a few years so I was very pleasantly surprised to see how much DUMBO was enhanced. Cecconi's is truly a GEM and a beautiful new addition to Brooklyn gorgeous waterfront. I cannot stop raving about this place. The staff, the food, the drinks and the decor are simply divine. I cannot wait to return here for ""Half Off Mondays"" and see the amazing and super friendly staff again. A HUGE shout out to Riccardo and Stevie. Both were amazing bartenders, very knowledgeable, and just such beautiful spirits!"	5star
The portions are perfect! Calamari was very tasty, crunchy and perfect on salt. There are so many items on the menu that looks great! Don't go with picky eaters because you want to dive in for the more festive Italian dishes and not just the chicken parmigiana (which was very good anyway). House wine was average. It would be nice to see a better selection of craft beer. Other than that keep it up. It's a wonderful place to go with family. One minor complaint. Please keep your reservations on time and have a hostess that is actually friendly. I could say more about them but why waste my time.	4star
Very nice interior, seating arrangement is mostly communal style long table with dividers between parties of 2.  *US Wagyu Udon: I love this broth. It's dashi style, very light and refreshing. the Wagyu beef is also very tender and comes out a bit rare so it can soak and cook in the broth.  *Salmon carpaccio: nothing special. I couldn't get that much of the torched salmon. The sauce is a bit overpowering making it salty.  *Soy garlic fried chicken: breading is good but way too salty! They do have a lot of variety in udon, ramen, donburi options with fun appetizers as well. Price is moderate. Main reason for 3 star is based on service. Service is spotty and it takes forever to get seated even if you made a reservation. Only one hostess for a big restaurant and she seemed overwhelmed. I've dined three times and waited until I wrote my review because I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt service will improve upon subsequent visits. But I was wrong! Best for parties of 2-4.	3star
Excellent deal for a set lunch. Rice and ramen set. Great same collection and the yummiest sake infused cocktails.	4star
My friend and I decided to pick a brunch place close to 5th Ave because we were going shopping right after. We didn't realize HOW POPULAR this place was (or that it had a specialty Sunday brunch menu...). We stopped by around 10 AM and there was no wait (YAY)! We were led to the cutest booth towards the back of the restaurant. This is one of those brunch locations that has good lighting, fancy tile walls with writing on it, etc (photo opportunities galore for girls LOL).  Their brunch menu is AMAZING. There are so many different combinations of food + you get a free bloody mary, bellini, barnstormer, passion punch, gatsby, or fresh squeezed juice with any of your brunch items (which are $11 if you order separately)! My friend and I decided to split the Smoked Salmon Toast (on ciabatta w/ lemon mascarpone and creme fraiche) ($18) and add on a side of home fries ($6) because we were getting KBBQ for lunch in an hour. Our server recommended their specialty, the Monkey Bread w/ toffee glaze.  SIDE NOTE: New York can't serve you alcohol until 11:00 AM (!?) so we didn't get our bellini (white peach puree + prosecco) until after we started our meal. Food was plated nicely (thank god for the arugla) and the home fries were SUPER crispy and flavorful. Service was great and we didn't feel rushed (even though the line outside was an hour wait by the time we were done with brunch at ~11:30 AM). COME VISIT & MAKE A RESERVATION IF YOU HAVE THE CHANCE. I would definitely recommend it more than PMF (Pardon My French)....	5star
Been going here for five years and it has been extraordinary. Small, intimate and cool atmosphere However, the last couple of meals have not been good and they've added expensive of specials not worth the price. I believe there is new management and chefs. The food was not as fresh and the tastes on some dishes were off. It's unfortunate because it was my favorite restaurant for Italian in the village	2star
ive been here many times. The food is really good, ambiance ok. But why did they change the way they serve/plate food? Main dishes come with salad. We used to order our drinks, enjoy the salads and wait for our main dish. Now, we order our drinks and wait a really really long time because salad comes on the same plate as the main corse	2star
Eh, it was okay, but definitely not worth a 4 or 5 star rating.  The restaurant was kind of dirty to be honest, very dim in there as well.  I ordered the one pound lobster for $20, which comes with salad, fries and your choice of regular or garlic lemon butter.  You also get a choice to grill or steam your lobster...I went steamed.  Other than the obvious bargain with the lobster, which was actually really good, I just don't see all the hype?  The food is good.  The atmosphere not so much.	3star
I gave this place one too many times chances to enjoy the experience but I always leave this place with a sour taste in my mouth. The servers act like they're doing a favor to you by serving you, a very unpleasant experience. I'm done with it and do Not recommend it to anybody, unless you're into being treated like s**t by your servers.	1star
"Was visiting my family in NY/NJ and stopped by here to see what everyone is talking about! This is probably the worst fake ""Middle Eastern"" food I have EVER had! Hands down! The food was awful and the service was worse! This place is like craving Mexican food and going to eat at a Taco Bell ! Do not waste your time or money on this dump!"	1star
Dinner starts at 5PM on the weekends. We made a last minute reservation for Sunday dinner just in case, but the restaurant itself was still pretty empty when we arrived. The restaurant is adorably decorated and I can't get enough of the logo!! Pigs are friends, but also so delicious. :9 Service was quick and friendly. Their dinner menu looked a little different from the one they have online, but not drastically different. Based off of previous Yelp reviews, we decided that we had to get at least one pork dish and the coconut rice. We were indecisive about what to get because there were so many things we wanted to try, but our server sold us on the night's special: fried quails with a watercress salad. As soon as we heard that, all of our attention towards the other menu items evaporated.  We ended up ordering the special and the sizzling sisig (of course) with a side of coconut rice (also a must). For the two of us, this was the perfect amount of food! The quail special ($20 for 2 whole quails halved) was sooooo good. I only wish we could grow quails to be the size of chickens because I could have eaten that much of this fried quail and still not have gotten sick of it! The meat was super flavorful and the skin was equally tasty! I liked the lime sauce with the meat, but enjoyed the meat even more on its own. I'm not sure how one goes about prepping fried quail, but P&K does it right!! My friend and I were joking about how glad we were that we were eating alone and wouldn't be judged for picking absolutely ALL of the meat off the little tiny bones. I'm guessing the sizzling sisig is one of P&K's signature dishes, and for good reason. It is delicious, and wonderfully presented! Be sure to mix in the raw egg early on though. I know this might be hard for all of those foodie photogs, but I think the whole point is to cook the egg before consumption... Don't look at the ingredients and you will feel less guilty about how many calories you are likely to be consuming in one meal. :P The coconut rice was cooked perfectly and the sweet coconut flavor really complemented the meats and the lime based sauce that came with the quail. We couldn't get enough of it. Overall, a superb meal! I would definitely recommend making an appointment during peak brunch/dinner hours as I'm sure this place is really popular!!	5star
Plain and simple, this is some of the best pizza I have ever had. When I went to New York the last time, we went on our own pizza crawl, trying all of the places we had heard of and this was my far my favorite. I now believe people when they say New York pizza is better for some reason. I'm still thinking about it sitting here in LA.  We got half of the Rubirosa Supreme and half Classic. I found there to be a good ratio and blend of cheese to sauce, which can be hard to find. The crust was perfectly cooked and exactly the right amount of thin and crispy for me. The service was friendly and attentive and the pizza came out fairly quickly, despite the restaurant being very pizza. I will definitely be going again the next time I am in New York!	5star
Like others I was not impressed. The crust was the best part of the pizza. Pizza itself lacked flavor and sauce. Not bad but not great and not worth a very long wait.	3star
I returned after not patronizing this establishment in a few years expecting a change in the food for the better.  Unfortuntely for me, I didn't find it.   I ordered the BBQ Jerk Salmon with pecan crusted filet with jerk glaze on curried succotash, vegetarian greens and mac & cheese.  The salmon was loaded with BBQ sauce, I didn't taste the jerk seasoning, and there was only maybe a half of a half teaspoon of the curried succotash.  The mac & cheese was ok.   What stood out was the service.  The host Arlara better known as LaLa is exceptional.  Very very professional, attentive, caring and very good at her job.  She is the type of person that should be out training others in customer service, no matter what the industry it is.  We had a very long wait for a table, but she made us so comfortable in explaining why there was a delay, even after I refused a table near the door because of the cold air would be blowing on my back every time the door open.  LaLa kept very calm during a hectic Wednesday night when you have people waiting for a table.  Particularly, she distinguished herself in the orchestrating the cleaning of the tables to seating the guest.  I was very impressed. Now there is Mel the server.  Talk about an on time server, knowledgeable, professional, and outgoing.  Mel is entertaining, sensitive and helpful to the guests needs and possesses very good balance and handiness in food delivery and keeping the guest very happy.   Lastly while waiting to be seated, a voice arose over the loud speaker and I thought Frankie Crocker was back.  For those who don't know, Frankie was a well known DJ for WBLS radio and later became a radio broadcaster  & program director.  Frankie voice was very smooth, deep and impressive.  The voice at Dinosaur belonged to Steven Lloyd the Service Director. If an announcement had to be made anywhere, it should be Steven Lloyd's voice that you would want to hear.   Both Arlara and Mel friendly nature will be beneficial to any organization.  It was a pleasure being served by them.	2star
***3.5 Stars*** Real good.Real friendly.Real chill. Real laid back.I felt the down south atmosphere here at Brooklyn Star. I had the family combo deal ($20 bucks). It came with southern style fried chicken, a whole bunch of sides.  Cole slaw,grits,mash potatoes,collard greens,bacon cornbread,that so delish mac and cheese,oh gwad. I absolutely love Brooklyn Star.  The chicken was good,a tad bit dry,but passable, especially when drizzled or doused in ranch dressing. The bacon cornbread was good,wished it had more bacony crunchiness, the collard greens were real good,and I didn't get that straight outta of a Green Giant can taste,fresh and actually pretty darn good. The cole slaw was not that impressive and the grits were more of an afterthought, but great the next day for breakfast.  Brooklyn Star, I heart you and the Chuck Norris posters.	3star
The food is just bad. I've tried Hendricks a few times since it is right near my office. Tonight I had the peach arugula salad and gnocchi. Both were so bad, I couldn't eat more than a few bites. Service is pretty good and the location is convenient for me but after several disappointing meals, I'm done.	2star
I ordered the short rib lasagna. It tasted like eating 50 layers of lasagna noodles with 2 teaspoons of sauce and one thick layer of cheese on top. This place is close by but I can't bring myself to eat here again	2star
Pretty good but also quite expensive! I liked that they had the squid ink pasta dish, which was not easy to find at a random Italian restaurant (for example, Eataly didn't serve this pasta dish). My friend and I did a walk-in so we had to sit at the bar. We ordered the squid ink pasta (LINGUINE NERE ALLA MONSIGNORE), the Veal Sorentino, and the GAMBERONI DELLO CHEF (jumbo shrimp risotto). The highlight of the dinner was the squid ink pasta. The pasta came with a variety of seafood (clams, jumbo shrimp, squid, scallops). The seafood wasn't the freshest, but the sauce and noodles were great! Thanks to the squid ink, the pasta noodles came with a hint of saltiness of the sea, but the saltiness wasn't overwhelming, but was sweetened down by the garlicky, buttery sauce. It was a great blend!  The risotto was good too. The rice was nutty (big oval white rice)  and the sauce was very creamy. The taste overall was pretty balanced, not too overwhelmingly creamy or fatty at all. Definitely a good dish. The shrimp was good too! The veal in the sorentino dish was super tender. Veal sorentino has a layer of veal steak, a layer of eggplant, and a  layer of cheese. I liked it, but not as much as the 2 former dishes. . Veal sorentino in general just wasn't me and my friend's favorite dish. We felt like it didn't convey the Italian culinary as much as the pastas and risottos. Anyways, for 3 dishes it came out pretty expensive - $100 including everything.  NOTE: Tips were auto-charged, but they still had a section in the bill for you to enter more tips. They were considerate enough to let us know about the auto-included tips though.	4star
My boyfriend was dying to come try the food at this famous steakhouse. We finally came here a few weeks ago for our anniversary (you have to make reservations way ahead of time). The restaurant was much more casual than I was expecting, which was a pleasant surprise, and our server was beyond friendly.  We ordered their Extra Thick Cut Bacon to start. It was like no other bacon I've ever had. The outside was crispy, but the inside was slightly chewy. It really just melts in your mouth. We proceeded to order the only actual steak on the menu, the Porterhouse Steak with a side of Creamed Spinach. The steak feeds 2 people and is served sizzling hot. The waiter actually cuts it for you and even serves pieces onto your plate, spooning the juicy goodness (our waiter called it vitamins) on top.  For a porterhouse steak, it was pretty good. However, it didn't blow my mind or change my life in any way. I've definitely had better steak, but it was an overall pleasant dining experience.	4star
"Totally turned off by the service here ... our waitress couldn't understand the concept of adding a scoop of ice cream to our shake and then proceeded to admonish my friend for having her foot touching the unused seat at our table , as she'd had her legs crossed.....saying that "" it would dirty the seat and people have to sit there "" ....REALLY???? It's a wood planked, metal framed OUTDOOR CHAIR ... guess what chair police ? It's already dirty ..., rude cold and no personality... barely checked the table after my friend checked her and her attitude... I May come back ..my salad was pretty good , my house Bloody Mary was pretty terrible .. like a tomato squeezed over a glass of lemon and horseradish water.. shake was ok ... managers need to train or get rid of some of the staff ...."	2star
Ordered delivery recently and it was NOT. GOOD. We ordered the Dear John and Pleasant Ave. pizzas, the salami on the Dear John tasted as though it had gone bad which left the whole pizza tasting sour. The Pleasant Ave had so much baby arugula that the other ingredients were just an after thought. The Zeppolis were rock hard and all of the soda choices but one were sold out. I'm still thinking I may give it another shot since it is down the street and maybe the in-house dining experience is a bit fresher but for now I'm giving one star to the host that answered the phone.

"Stopped in here for a lunch date. We both got lobster rolls and there were some really cool soft drinks in a cooler that we were compelled to try. Both of our drinks were agreeable. It's a small restaurant so we didn't immediately have seats but did after a short while. Our lobster rolls came out and my firsts thought was, ""they're so tiny!"" Granted, they were absolutely delicious and well-made with cold lobster and a warm bun, but for $17 a pop I'd expect to not still be hungry afterwards. I could have easily eaten two, and I'm a thin guy. Like I said, everything was good, my only complaint is the portions."	4star
I was excited to try this place because of all the amazing reviews, but I was not very impressed.  The interior is very homey and crowded. It's ny, so it's not a big deal that the inside was cramped.. but all the tables were too close together that everyone kept bumping into each other even when we were seated.  We went around dinner time, and were immediately seated. However, we sat there for 15-20 minutes twiddling our thumbs to get glasses of water and to order. And we're fairly certain that the waitress stopped to serve us because she saw that I was on yelp looking for other restaurants in the area, since we were thinking about just leaving due to the slow service.  I got one of their margaritas, which was pretty solid.  Not normally a huge fan of Mexican food.. but my friends (who are huge fans) agreed that the food was just ok/good.  Unlimited chips though!	3star
I always love this Korea fusion bar restaurant! 1st time back after they relocated (from a few blocks Away). Good food as always and the decor is really charming.  It's a very convenient spot in Union Square to meet up with friends for happy hours and dinner. Needless to say, I will definitely keep frequent this joint.	5star
We have driven past this place many times and finally checked it out. Decor: rustic as the theme is the roaring 20's.  The fireplace gives it a nice touch. Service: our waiter Aldo was attentive and welcoming. His knowledge of the menu was a plus, even suggested his recommendations. Food: presentation, flavor : Great! I had the fried shrimp with a seasonal pumpkin sauce as an appetizer. The seafood risotto was phenomenal!  Will definitely return and recommend for future dinners and special occasions!	4star
The food and service was fine, nothing particularly outstanding. I'm from Uzbekistan myself and personally, I wouldn't consider it authentic. The portions were small and overpriced.	2star
I was starving when I walked into Hometown BBQ. It was 3pm this past Sunday afternoon, and I had only eaten avocado toast that morning in order to have a decent appetite for this place. We took the F to Smith/9th from 1st Avenue on the Upper East Side, then walked the rest of the way, which was no small feat. As we were walking, it began to snow gently, and so with slightly tired legs, and slightly pink cheeks, we arrived at the warm hearth of Hometown BBQ. There were so many things on the menu that I wanted to try, from sandwiches to tacos, and queso mac and cheese to cornbread and pickles. Since it was so late in the day, we chose to split everything. There was plenty of room to get a table, as well as 2 full bars. I absolutely loved everything we tried, the peppery burnt ends of the brisket, the gamy pulled lamb, the creamy pimiento spiked mac and cheese, and the stewed collard greens. I would really like to come back with a few friends in order to try more. I haven't been to Fette Sau in a few years, so I cannot make the practically inevitable comparison, but I really liked the food and vibe at Hometown BBQ, particularly on a wintry late afternoon.	4star
We went to Bushwick to explore two Saturday's ago. We dined at the always amazing Guacuco Arepera, Yours Sincerely, and Amaranto! We were seated immediately. Our waiter was less than enthusiastic and took our order, water for me (too many drinks earlier in the evening), a beer for my husband, and guacamole. The beer that my husband order never came so there is that wonderful thing. The guacamole was just meh! It was lacking in any salt/lime excitement it was just fine! We then ordered a chicken and pork taco. The chicken taco was super suck-o and the pork was actually very good. We then planned to order more food but were basically ignored and compiled with the lackluster quality of food and the fact that ordered items didn't even come we decided to pay and leave. This was super disappointing and this place should be ashamed of itself and it's staff!	1star
Long before I dined here for the first time, I fell in love with Scott Conant's famous Tomato Sauce after seeing the recipe in a magazine and giving it a shot at home. I was so intrigued by the technique he uses, which is carefully thought out, and yet so simple. The result was an incredibly flavorful sauce that in one word could be described as luxurious.  How many sauces can you say that about? I knew that I would love Scarpetta before I even stepped foot in the door.  When I finally went it was for Restaurant Week. I always appreciate when a Restaurant Week menu actually features standard menu items, which was the case here. Even better was the fact that despite how busy the restaurant was, the quality of the food and the service did not suffer in the slightest. To me that says a lot about a dining establishment.   I would describe the decor at Scarpetta as slightly modern with a polished elegance. Our server was fantastic -- warm, knowledgeable and attentive. To start they gave us a lovely assortment of fresh breads and delicious spreads to go with them. The highlight for me was the one with prosciutto and cheese baked into the dough. If it was on the menu I would order it.  I tried the Creamy Polenta, the famed Spaghetti, and the Valrhona Chocolate Cake for dessert. It was easily one of the best meals I have had. The hallmark of Italian cuisine is the simplicity of it; quality over quantity. That comes through in every one of these dishes. Nothing is overdone, which allows for perfect balance and the complexity of the flavors to really come through. I'll echo my same sentiments from earlier, there is a luxurious quality to this food, that leaves you feeling wonderfully satisfied. It's definitely one of my favorite upscale Italian restaurants here in New York.	5star
My friend and I came here before a concert at the Beacon theater one night. It was definitely further from the Beacon than we thought, but it was really good and worth it to come.  We made our reservation a week prior on the Yelp app which was very convenient. When we got there we were seated at a two top table around the bar area. We were given food and cocktails menus. We both opted for one of their speciality cocktails, I got the Peasant's fix which was with Tito's vodka and my friend got the Divine Derecho which was a tequila based cocktail. The cocktails were okay, but we both agreed we could of just went with our go to of Tito's and seltzer.  As apps we went for the pork dumplings. I thought it was a little weird they were on the menu since BEA isn't an Asian style restaurant, but they ended up being really good.  As entrees I got the Empire State Burger and my friend got the Chilean Sea Bass. The food was delicious. I love burgers that are on English muffins, and the Empire State burger was served in an English muffin, and it was cooked perfectly.  After we finished dinner we were able to stay at our table and order a few more rounds of drinks until we had to leave. The prices were reasonable for the city and the food was really good.  The one downside was the line that forms for the bathroom. We both had to wait over 10 minutes on a crowded bathroom line that forms at the back of the restaurant.	4star
I chose this spot for dinner with a friend who was in town. Typically I'm wary of restaurants that are too loungey bc I find the food lacking but I was looking for a place with good drinks and ambiance so I figured I would t be let down. I was not prepared for how wonderful the food was going to be!! Here's what we ordered: general tso soup dumplings  Pork belly buns  Child chicken  Miso cod  Sausage fried rice with soft egg  Blueberry cheesecake  Bread pudding  Everything gets 5/5. Amazing! Drinks were great. The food was enough to feed 3 adults.  Also, we didn't have reservations and didn't want to wait for a table so instead we opted to eat in the lounge area and had a lovely time.  Great service. We noticed lots of bachelorette parties (perhaps bc of SATC). Awesome spot for a great dinner and fun night out.	5star
Well, kiss my grits! If you're not into eating chicken they have fried catfish and more than enough meatless sides to tide one over. Plus, the crawfish hush puppies rock! Not a huge menu but if you're into fried chicken and waffles this is the joint to be at when in the LES. To me, the desserts are hit or miss but always worth a shot. Chill atmosphere and friendly attentive staff. Prices are good for the portion size. Be prepared to wait a bit for a table on busy weekend nights, but it moves fast if you're patient. Not a place to dine at when dieting, as it's southern style comfort eats. Collard greens, Welch's grape soda, cornbread, and fried goodness. I almost want to take off a star for charging $3 for cornbread (which should be gratis in a basket when seated) but I'll let it pass as the food, vibe, and service more than makes up for it.	4star
The best part was the guacamole that we got with the Yelp check in. Was expecting more with 4 stars on Yelp. Calamari was rubbery and the salad had weird smokey taste to it when it shouldn't(basaltic vinegar and lettuce). The lobster roll was just odd. The lobster was minced basically. The roll was pretty good though.  The part worst was the service. We had to get up for everything. More water, to order, the check. Not into that kind of service when there are so many other places with great service and food. Good ambiance though.	2star
Undisputed king of FiDi ramen joints.  One of the better places to have a fantastic lunch experience in the land of 'meh' lunches.   It's up there with Sam's Falafel cart, meaning if I lived around here I would eat here off hours too.	4star
Second time here and out fails to disapppoint. This great little secret is a secret no more. Out thou want too dine pretheatre, make a reservation.  My wife and I shared a tricolor salad which was fresh and tasty. Then I had the most tender Veal Chop on the bone and my wife enjoyed Chicken Marsala. For dessert we shared a poached Bosc pear with vanilla gelato. Now its off to the theatre, content and satisfied.	5star
Six of us had a terrific dinner last night at this place. Starters included charred octopus & salads. The steak entre was delicious! It was cooked to your taste & sliced beautifully on the plate. Portions were ample. I had the orchietto with butter & cheese-WOW, so good. Nice wine list- try the Malbec, very good. Desserts included a delicious pumpkin bread with Carmel & whipped cream and cookies with milk. The cookies were huge with various flavors. A great meal at a fair price and we'll be back.	5star
Go early! We went around 12:30 and it had recently opened and fortunately we only waited 15mins.  The service was prompt and the food delicious! You have to try the buns for starter!	5star
On my first 4 tries, their pasticceria was sold out by 5pm, but this time I was able to grab the Sicilian Oregano Olive Oil Cake ($4.36), which was fine, but far from memorable. Each of the 5 visits, the host(ess) shot awkward glances my way as I walked toward the to-go counter, where the person working that zone was condescending.	3star
Cute hole in the wall with communal tables and wall to wall Asians. On my first night in NYC, it is cold--not NYC cold but definitely freezing for this Cali girl. So really I HAD to chase ramen, if only to warm my bones.  Service is kinda meh cuz you really can't tell who the hipster clientele is from the hipster wait staff, and you kinda have to yell to get their attention, which because I had just landed and was hangry, I had no problem doing.  But the food is amazing; I had the chili ramen with the spicy ground chicken and pork. Man, I loved them noodles and I appreciated the perfectly sliced soft boiled egg which was still a lil runny. And boy did all the slurping clear up wrecked sinuses. And with my ice cold Asahi beer, it was perfection.  Glad I found this minuscule joint and glad they take credit cards as I forgot to hit the ATM before the trip. Doh!	4star
This place can get pretty busy during certain hours however it's an awesome place to stop by if you're down for some good ol burgers and tacos. Aside from some negative views I was greeted by friendly staff with good food. Can't complain there.	5star
What happened to class? I've been to Los Angeles (closed), Las Vegas, Miami and New York Scarpetta restaurants.  New York location is one I won't insist on going back to.  Service and food is great, but for the $$$, dress code should be enforced.  Visited this place with my wife few days ago, dressed up before concert, sat next to a pair of cracked heels in flip flops.  Unbelievable.	3star
We went on a Saturday night for dinner and some drinks.   We got the caipirinha carafe to start and that was very underwhelming. It was mostly ice with very little flavor or alcohol. We then got the sangria. The red sangria was good but the white sangria was mostly sugar water.  I tasted the guacamole and the mushroom quesadilla. The quesadilla was good and in a nice sharable portion. Guacamole was good but nothing out of the ordinary. For mains I had the veggie burger. The burger itself was good but the accompanying yuca fries were meh.  Overall, good for once but not vastly different from other similar places.	3star
I've never been someone who uses yelp much but I was so shocked by the service  last night I had to say something  now looking at these reviews im wondering if I was at the same bar as these people. The bar tender was nice when he welcomed my date and I and that was all I can say for my experience with him other than his drinks were on point. The food was really good and filling for the prices specially the steak Tatar but the compliments end there. the service was terrible. Our waitress didn't refill our waters after we asked twice and she looked like she was always on her phone or couldn't be bothered. I hope that this experience was a one time thing because this bar has a lot of potential.	2star
I love this place so much probably way more than one should. Besides the bulgogi hot stone bowl I can eat the crispy tofu forever. They have a happy hour and outdoor seating and the option to for korean bbq. All very important. The service is friendly although not always attentive. During one visit a friend and I had to return our cocktails in exchange for wine because they were so sweet it was hard to take down. The manager came by and apologized and offer a new round or something else in it's place. Later the server apologized again. I appreciated the follow up from both. Definitely will be back. Definitely can attribute some weight gain to this place. Definitely worth it.	5star
The noodles and beef [Ns2] that I got were really good, just the right amount of spice but honestly not worth $13.25 for a small bowl of noodles and a drink. It's good, not worth it however.  The cashier with white glasses and messy yellow hair was very rude from the start to finish. Attitude was given when I politely asked where to get the drinks and where were the straws. I would come back but when she isn't here, I cannot tolerate how she acts towards a customer.  In addition, the drinks had DIRT and DUST on the plastic thin wrapping, and are not prepared fresh. They are stored upside down in a fridge to the left of the cashier. I could have gotten bubble tea for $1 next door instead of paying $2 for dirty jasmine tea.	2star
Horrible customer service.  I got seated right next to a corner table. I asked if I can be seated there. The first response I got was they were going to merge it with the other table. And I asked a second time this time they told me they wanted to seat a party of three. A min later they seated another party of two. I asked again, they told me, it was for a reservation.  They just bull shit me. Right in my face. And then the manager was being rude, trying to shut me off. Stay away. I was looking for something quick to eat but their food is not worth their horrible service.	1star
This place is as good as all of the reviews.	5star
Nothing impressive here. I feel the food is over priced for its quality.  The restaurant was clean and it did offer happy hour throughout the whole day so that's a plus.	2star
Joju may be out of the way from where I live but this is definitely my favorite place to get my banh mi fix! It's a bit pricier than getting a banh mi from other restaurants but Joju's sandwiches will not disappoint (it's SO good and always fresh). I usually go for the Joju banh mi which is the original. The banh mi fries are great too! 10/10 would recommend this place.	5star
I love Gramercy Tavern, from the neo-Colonial decor to how, just when you think you're finished with your meal, the waiter pops by with some blood orange truffles. I even love the ladies who lunch and the rotating groups of summer associates from all the nearby law firms.  But most of all, I love their cookie platter with milk. Hear me out. The platter comes with oatmeal cookie, rugelach, pecan bar, lemon cookie, whoopie pie, brownie, and poppy seed cookie. If I wasn't with other people, I would have dived in. The oatmeal cookie did the impossible - it convinced me that its oatmeal raisin brethren weren't the devil's spawn. Hands down, my favorite thing that we ordered.  The beet salad and striped bass were excellent enough, but, seeing as how neither is loaded with sugar, don't quite merit my effusive adoration. Keep in mind that the portion sizes are on the small to reasonable side, so, unless you eat three quarters of a cookie platter, you'll walk out of here feeling quite pleasantly satiated. If, however, you do choose to order the cookie platter AND two separate desserts, you may need to skip dinner.  NEXT TIME: I've only ever eaten in the Dining Room, but I hear amazing things about the Tavern's off-menu burger.	5star
What great portions!! Pork belly one piece for 12 bucks ?!! really ? Portions far too small for the price charged!'	1star
"My husband and I enjoyed Happy Hour at Amelie on Saturday, Oct 21. We arrived around 5:45 and the restaurant filled up quickly. We sat at the bar and we're attended to by a friendly and informative French speaking staff. We discussed ""likes"" in wines with the bartender and ordered two flights of wine, escargots and olives. All delicious. The flights were 3 glasses of wine for $12. My husband then ordered the hanger steak and I the special duck breast (the skin was crispy!) and we both enjoyed our entrees.  I liked the atmosphere of their restaurant but found the metal chairs rather uncomfortable. As is normal with NYC the tables were a little tight. No one (except one couple who left without eating because of this spacing issue) seemed to mind. We enjoyed meeting some folks at Amelie and the food. We will be back."	4star
Came to Brooklyn with my husband and daughter to meet a good friend who recommended this restaurant and we were not disappointed! We shared a bottle of rosé and started with the whipped ricotta with truffle honey. This was by far the best and most memorable dish I had in the city this week. The tuna tartare was amazing and the service was extremely attentive and friendly. The mini wood-fired pizza was delicious and the perfect size for me. The server brought us a tasting of two red wines to choose from when the time came for our second bottle, which was a nice added touch. I would definitely come here again. Before you leave, don't forget to exit through the back of the building and see the city lights along the waterfront. It was the perfect end to a wonderful evening.	5star
Came here back in 2010 when it was called Grimaldis so was confused when I walked up and saw Grimaldis at the corner building, and this one in its place. My friend was in NYC the past year and was adamant that Juliana's was the best pie in NYC, but I was sure it was Grimaldis. Decided to try it out, but found out that the real Grimaldis was Juliana's and he had sold the original pizzeria to a previous employee. So the one I went to 8 years ago was an imposter! At the time I thought that was the best pizza I had ever had, but I honestly don't remember that much about it since I didn't yelp back then. This time my friend and I got a small margarita with mushrooms and sausage. It was my perfect pie. Thin and crispy with fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce. I also appreciated that the tomato sauce was subtle and not overly acidic. All the flavors melded really well into the pizza. We came on a Saturday around 5ish when they reopen for dinner and it was packed. Luckily since we were just two people, it was easy to get a table. We waited like 5 mins as opposed to the group of four who got there at the same time and waited an extra 25 mins. Believe the hype, this is the real ny style pizza. By the slice places are good for quick, cheap eats, but if you want a quality pie, make sure you get it fresh here!	5star
This is a Harlem Staple! Try the fried chicken and waffle, not to be super cliche it is amazing! My absolute favorite is the Reggie Harris - fried chicken drizzled in honey, you can thank me now. Be mindful there is always a line and wait so be mindful.	4star
Food was fine. I went with a group, we left tip in cash, so didn't leave any credit card tip. They added it to the card transaction after the fact. Sleazy.	1star
"This is a fun place, but it is very crowded and a bit overpriced given the quality of other neighborhood options for less.  It's in the ""friends building"" so don't be surprised by a bunch of tourists outside taking pictures."	3star
I wanted to love this place. Mario Batali seems so authentic and has so many restaurants, that I was convinced that this was a must-visit restaurant while in NYC. Unfortunately, we were disappointed. Though the food was not bad, it wasn't special. We asked if there was a charcuterie plate and we received a meat-only board. I rarely salt restaurant food but would have appreciated a shaker on the table to flavor my food. Perhaps it was a bad night as the table next to us seemed un-impressed as well and they were return guests. Also, for a meal for two averaging about $150,  would have liked to sit at a table without having other guests 4 inches away from me (not exaggerating), on both sides. I am a small person and the waitress had to scoot the table to one side just to allow me to squeeze into my seat.	3star
This restaurant did not disappoint. The highlights were definitely the squid ink spaghetti and pappardelle bolognese. Loved it.	5star
"I didn't try their avocado on toast because it is avocado on toast. I can buy a loaf of bread and some avocados myself at the supermarket and make dozens of Cafe Gitane's ""special item"" for 1/10 of the price tag. Seriously, why would you want to pay so much for something so simple that you can make at home at such little cost? Anyway, onto the food that I did have... We had the couscous with sausage and spicy organic meatballs. I noticed many customers ordering the couscous so I took a few bites from my friend's plate and expected to be amazed but I was rather disappointed. There was nothing special about this. Tasted just like any regular couscous that was tossed around with raisins and other veggies. The meatballs get the same statement; tasted just like any regular meatball you get elsewhere. It was rather tame despite being accompanied with a boiled egg. It's more like boring + boring = fail Completely overpriced for the quality of food you're getting here. Skip when you can. Also, the service was dismal. We didn't get any water until we ordered dinner whereas a couple that came after us got their water soon after they sat down. We later then ran out of water and they didn't bother refill the bottle.  Waitress goes, ""Check?""  Friend goes, ""How about some water?"" Womp womp..."	2star
The burrata we had to start was nice, but probably could have done without the kale (I guess that's a personal preference). For the mains, the pasta dishes were both tasty, and the service was very good.	4star
Been here about 3 times so far! First time I went I brought the chicken & waffle which wasn't bad, it was good. Second time I went and got the Jambalaya and I loved it, when I went there my third time I ordered the Jambalaya once again. Unfortunately it didn't taste as good as the last time, which sucked.  It gets very busy in there so even if you make your reservations, you'll still have to wait either by the bar or outside if you can't deal with crowd. It is a nice atmosphere I must say. Cool place for brunch and birthday dinner. Ps: Don't wear any hats, they won't allow!	4star
I had heard great things about this reverse speakeasy. The food was excellent and being able to sit at the counter watching it be prepared was really cool. HOWEVER, I will won't be going back and won't be recommending it to any friends for the following reason: after checking my credit card statement the following week I noticed that I was charged more that the authorised amount on the receipt. I assumed this was a simple input error, but the dealing since that moment have been terrible. It took multiple emails to even get an acknowledgement, then when I provided the transaction information it went weeks without a response. A month later I contacted them again to see what was going on and once again silence. It's now coming up to 2 months since the meal and I still don't know what happened and I was never refunded the additional money. I'm pretty sure that taking money that wasn't authorised is THEFT! If you have been to this place recently, please please check your statements. If you are thinking of going, I would advise caution which is a shame as the product from the kitchen is excellent	2star
Our party of 4 came in on a Saturday around 1:30 PM and waited about 25 mins for a table in the back. There was a great jazz band playing live music so the wait was chill  Our waitress was very friendly and we all enjoyed our food. My dad thought there was a little too much lemon juice or vinegar on his avocado smash though. The other two got the Irish breakfast and I got the breakfast flatbread which had 2 perfectly fried eggs. We also all loved our cocktails in particular. Recommended cocktails: Sing Sing and the Grapefruit Spritz	4star
The hostess screwed up our order and when we told her about it, she said it was our fault and wouldn't fix it. We asked to speak to the owner and she wouldn't come out of the kitchen to speak. They charged us 36 dollars for two dishes we didn't even order. Never going here again.	1star
I came here due to the amazing looking desserts and high reviews. The food and drinks here are disgusting! It's not edible! I ordered three drinks and all of them tasted like syrup mixed with water. And when the food came I was even more disappointed. The fish was chewy, corn fritters were not crispy, curry noodle has no flavor, chicken was not fresh, pork blood tasted weird.. Everything was wrong! I will never come back here again. Do not eat here! The worst meal I ever had! If you're looking for the worst meal to have then you found the right place.	1star
We went early before our show and it was busy for 4:30pm on a Friday - a good sign , but no wait.  Very friendly knowledgeable servers that guide you through the menu.  Portions are very generous and we a Southern BLT ($17) , buffalo Mac and Cheese($15)with food left over.  The cocktails were incredible- the Brine Margarita was outstanding with a smoky kick and lots of flavor( no mixes here) and $13 served in a pint jar!  The porch sipper is a bourbon lovers dream and a great Fall/Winter drink.  They don't take reservations for parties under 6 people, but don't let that deter you from visiting this fun place.  6+ book via  . Sister restaurant opened a few months ago, also on 84th street with more dinner style items.   It's called Maison Pickle.  Make a point to try here.	5star
1Star is generous. Ordered delivery, received our food on time, but that was the only good part. Pad Thai was awful, chicken was chewy and obviously over cooked. Edamame was frozen, not fresh and not dressed with salt as described. Duck Salad which was $12 had microscopic pieces of duck very little lettuce and was mostly cashews. The wings were torn apart and cooked till so dry it was hard to eat. I will never order from here again and I would suggest you stay away it was simply awful. I called and spoke to someone to see if they could come and pick the food back up so I could get a refund and it wasn't agreed upon until I reached out to Grubhub to facilitate.	1star
Got the 3 types of dumplings with noodles. It's interesting that they have two different sizes and I'd definitely go for the large to get enough. The three dumplings were all very good but I've had better noodles.  It didn't have as much elasticness to it (it's called Q in Cantonese).	4star
The ambience and location of blue smoke helped me (slightly) forget the lackluster entree. Spicy fried chicken sandwich came out cold and unspicy. The chicken was tendon-y and was not properly trimmed. The Cajun chips that it came with tasted stale.	2star
"First time coming here and I gotta say I was very impressed with everything. First started off with the fried calamari and it was delicious! The only minor issue was that it also came with the tentacle legs, and I'm used to other places only serving the rings so it was different. For the entree my two friends and I had 2 combo As (1lb of crawfish and shrimp), and 2lbs of scowcrab legs am served on different sauces of garlic butter, lemon pepper, and ""the boil"" sauce. The seafood was excellent and the crawfish came big in sizes. The sauces were all very good, very creamy so I could see why others would enjoy it. The service was exceptional so no complaints at all with that. If we ever needed anything they were always on top of it. Definitely coming back for their other options that i havent tried when I have the chance!"	5star
I don't understand all the hype? I tried this place for the first time, cause I read all the amazing reviews. I came out of way to have this experience and not only is there no parking but the line was at least 30 minutes to sit and eat in this tiny hole in the wall place. It took forever to get the waitress's attention to order take out. I literally walked in and stopped her, and gave her my order. There was only one waitress serving everyone in the place, about 15 people. Needless to say she was rude and dismissive. I ordered 2 orders of wontons, fried and steamed, and 2 beef stew soups, with 2 ice tea bottles. Total came to $22. My order took about 15 minutes and I had to go and get it from the waitress. Now the food: The wontons were good, but they weren't exceptional. And the soup wasn't anything extraordinary, actually they really could put more meat in it and charge an extra couple of bucks. There's an imbalance in the noodles to meat ratio which I found unsatisfying, cause I like noodles but I love meat with them So nope, not headed back to this spot again, the food, the wait, the service simply isn't worth it, when there's so much better waiting for you in Ctown. Happy Yelping!	2star
I really wanted to like this because its so close to where I live but the hard ciabatta bread that was the base of my lox w cream cheese really ruined the experience. The lox were great, and cream cheese portions were more than generous, I actually had to take a knife and take some of it out but really for 13$ which includes any brunch entree + a juice/coffee is a great deal. If the bread was normal I woulda given this 4 stars.	3star
I think this place is producing Instagram food. Those baked potatoes look great in the picture but they are nothing special. You can imagine in your mind what the cod and caviar etc will taste like with a baked potato and that's what you get. Their cooking doesn't gel into something truly delicious. Most disappointing were the roasted oysters which had a peculiar hard texture from overcooking and no oyster taste.	2star
Flavors are far from being authentic indian. Probably worst chicken tikka masala, I have ever had. Too high on turmeric. Masking all the other creamy, rich, delicate flavors that are typically expected from tikka masala. I know Indian food very well, being from the same ethnicity. And I would say - avoid this rip off place or if you chose to visit, do not judge Indian food based on what is served here :)	1star
Had lunch at Galli last weekend... Ambiance is nice. Loved the high ceilings and the restaurant is well lit. Service is very friendly and food came out VERY quickly. Food is where Galli falters.  - Seabass - while presented nicely, the quality of this fish was very much lacking and wasn't properly deboned. I wouldn't recommend this dish at all. - Chicken - the portion was tiny and my husband also mentioned the quality wasn't there. - Pasta w/ Eggplant and Mozzarella - this looked delicious and my daughter loved it. I couldn't try it because of the cheese but she finished off the small portion quickly. Prices are really high, especially considering the portion sizes of everything at Galli are quite small. There are many good reviews for Galli so obviously we are obviously in the minority here but I doubt we'll return.	3star
Best ramen in NYC right here!  It's a modern and hip restaurant tucked down off the sidewalk a few blocks from Times Square; looks deceivingly small from the outside but once you enter it's very open and nice.  They have a bar when you enter, an area of bar-like seating in the next room, and a whole entire seating area in yet another room. We were very lucky and got seated in 5 minutes for lunch on a Saturday in the second room with the bar.  I ordered the Akamaru Modern, and Oh.  My.  Goodness.  The noodles are cooked to perfection.  The broth is creamy and so flavorful with that added touch of garlic oil.  The sliced pork is unbelievably tender and stays that way even though it's sitting in hot soup.  I added a hearty soft boiled egg; can't have no ramen with no egg!  The whole time I'm eating I'm making big eyes because it tastes soo good.   My boyfriend ordered the Shiromaru Hakata Classic with the sliced pork option, which is very flavorful, and he usually isn't a ramen person but he enjoyed it. Food does not take too long to come out, and the service is friendly and prompt.  We never had to ask to have our waters refilled.  Price is about the same as other ramen places in the city, came out to be about $20 per person.  Only bummer is you can't take your leftovers home to enjoy another round of all the goodness, which just means next time I'm wearing loose pants	4star
Bad as it gets.  Food was bland.  Service was an abomination. Don't want to waste more time on this experience with a verbose review other than to say I am sure there is something shady about the 5 star reviews.	1star
The atmosphere is very quaint and intimate.  That's about the only good thing here. The food really was subpar. We got everything or waitress said were the best sellers. And the only good thing was the truffle pizza.  Also the tapas list is mostly vegetarian so anyone who needs meat in their meals. Don't come here. I wouldn't recommend this place for tapas, maybe for drinks to sit outside with couple pals. But definitely not for the food.	2star
I am hoping this review helps the restaurant since I am so happy to have a BBQ restaurant in Forest hills.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich which was dry like saw dust.  I've traveled all over the country and had BBQ and this was by far the worst. It came with french fries which was excellent and Cole slaw which was good but to small a portion.  My daughter had the short rib taco.  This was juicy and moist ( wish the pulled pork was) but it was supposed to have avocado pieces in which was missing.  We also had the burrata salad.  Very good but too small a portion.  We love the decor of the restaurant  and the young vibe.  I hope the chef and owner get their act together because this can become a destination spot in Forest Hills.	2star
The atmosphere here is fun. I've enjoyed many a margarita outside and felt the sense of giddiness all New Yorkers feel drinking in an outdoor space that's bigger than a postage stamp. Unfortunately the food isn't so good. My husband and I both got ill once after eating here. And NOT because we had too many margaritas. So eat your meal elsewhere, then come for your frozen drink and hope you can snag a spot in the shade.	2star
Umm honestly baffled how anyone could give Calle Ocho less than 5 stars. The sangria is fricken bomb, and the food is stellar as well. I love drunk brunch and I've tried a ton of places, and hands down Calle Ocho comes in at the top.  The breakfast muffins we got as an app were almost as heavenly as the homemade strawberry butter we got to smother all over them. For a meal, I got the vaca frita, which I highly recommend. Pro tip: the fresas is the best sangria so just pound down those.	5star
This is a lobster shack, NY style.  Cramped, divey, theme décor on a budget.  Forget all that. The people that work there genuinely seem to care about what they do.  The food is good, authentic, and fresh.  The music they play while you wait is great.  They have some fun sodas in the fridge. Think the anti-Subway $5 foot long.  You don't get a million choices, and the food wasn't prepared in a warehouse in Texas.  You will pay three times $5 or more.  Some days they just might be out of one thing or another.  They don't wear little green uniforms. Now, some reviewers will critique the celery to lobster ratio, the thickness of the mayo, the style of coleslaw, the size of the crab claw, the fact that soda bottle tops aren't twist offs.  You know those kind of reviews. But it all depends upon your outlook.  I mean, c'mon, a lobster shack in downtown Manhattan staffed by cool people who play great music.  Makes me hungry for it right now. In fact, I'm going to swing by tonight and get a pile of stuff to go.  I'm going to hustle it back to my apartment, crack open a beer, put my feet up, watch something on the DVR, and be glad for simple pleasures.  And while others are analyzing the carrot to cabbage ratio in the slaw, I'll be dreaming about a Maine vacation.	4star
"Went for lunch while my boyfriend parked the car. There was no one in the restaurant and I asked to use the bathroom as soon as I got there.  The hostess tells me ""Your not allowed to use the bathroom my boss will get mad."" Hospitality starts with the hostess. I will never be back."	1star
And as the fine dining summer continues, we move on to Nomad and its famous chicken for two... I was extremely excited and had high expectations for this place, and perhaps it was because of that that I didn't find myself pleasantly surprised or overwhelmed by the quality of the food. Nonetheless! We had a reservation at 7:30 on Saturday night and were promptly seated near the entrance -- which I understand is a problem for some diners due to the constant commotion of people coming in and out of the restaurant, but I don't particularly mind and in fact rather enjoy watching the kind of people who come to dine at this restaurant. The conclusion is that the crowd seems to be much younger than some other high-end places we've been to, and we might be the min there but only by a few years (the min is more or less obvious by the fact that we were embarrassingly the only ones who can't order some form of alcohol and had to decline the wine list offer).  We sat there for an extremely awkward non-trivial number of minutes (perhaps 10?) before a waiter finally walked up to us and kindly pointed out that our menus were under the napkins. I almost died. So of course we had to get the chicken for two, and then we decided to share the egg appetizer to leave room for dessert. We gave our order, and our bread arrived shortly after. I also had probably unrealistic expectations for the bread judging from the pictures (I mean, just look at it), but I was underwhelmed -- I thought it was too dry, and I'm not a huge fan of incorporating potatoes, although the green onions was a plus but that might be personal preference.  The egg appetizer arrived after about ten or fifteen minutes, which was very fast and put us slightly ahead of schedule. It had an interesting look, kind of like a yellow circle on top of salad. It was very pretty, and I enjoy looking at pretty things. I took one bite out of the egg (the circle stuff), and immediately stopped because the yellow sauce on top was way, WAY too strong for my liking. So I let my companion finish the rest of the egg while I made my way through the vegetables, which I liked much more.  Then, after we finished our appetizer, a waiter brought a full chicken for us to see and introduced it as the chicken we would eat. Having read other reviews, we of course didn't believe that this was specifically our chicken, but we played along anyway to humor them and pretended to be impressed at meeting our dish (good thing they didn't give the chicken a name). Which is all fine and well, but after about another fifteen minutes, a waiter brings us ANOTHER whole chicken and introduces THIS ONE as the one we were going to eat. I was about to remark on it, but decided to hold my sass back, and we just smiled this time. No further comments to be made here... So the service wasn't great, this is true, but the chicken was out of this world. I usually throw out white meat if I see it because I think it's too bland, but the way they did this chicken was unbelievable. I was insanely impressed with the texture of the skin and the stuffing underneath it, and thought it paired extremely well with the chicken meat, which was soft and, for lack of better words, quite perfect. The portion was decent. The dark meat was served in two bowls placed between us, and while I enjoyed it (although not as much as the white meat), my companion found it to be too creamy.  Afterwards, we ordered the blackberry cobbler for dessert because I wasn't a huge fan of the pictures of the milk and honey. It was good, not too sweet, and the bread on top satisfied my carb cravings that the potato bread couldn't accomplish. The ice cream that was paired was interesting, since the lime on top was slightly salty and the ice cream was sweet, but it worked, and I enjoyed dessert very much. They gave us the check, which was very reasonable and actually quite underpriced for a Michelin star restaurant (around $160 after tip and tax). Since the food came out so fast, we decided to sit and talk for another half hour before departing. However, as we left, we didn't fail to notice that the ladies in front did not say anything as we walked by them, which we both found kind of strange.  So in all, the chicken was wonderful and lived up to standards, but since I'm a princess and want to be treated like royalty and feel particularly snubbed when I'm not given a greeting on my way out, I probably won't come back, even if I'll be dreaming about chicken for the rest of my days.	3star
"I went here for lunch with a bunch of co-workers. The restaurant wasn't super crowded, so the 5 of us were seated immediately. Initially, the service seemed great. Our waiter promptly brought out some fried corn for us to snack on, and got our drink orders very quickly. However, things deteriorated after we ordered our food. I got the mushroom chicken dish and a glass of white sangria (nothing like going back to work a little tipsy, right?), intending to use the coupon for $3 off that you get for checking in here on Yelp. Our food took a very long time to arrive despite the fact that there seemed to be enough staff and not an overwhelming amount of customers. The sangria didn't taste bad, but it seemed very watered-down. The dish I got tasted pretty good, but it was extremely creamy and very salty, and really sat in my stomach. That being said, the amount of food we all got was very generous, and you definitely get a bang for your buck here. After all of us had finished eating, we wanted a very long time for our waiter to even come over to us. When he finally did, I asked for the check and he was very confused, and called over someone who seemed in charge (maybe the manager)? She understood that we wanted the check, and I presented the coupon for the sangria to her. She refused to accept it, claiming that ""at all restaurants you must show them the Yelp coupon first."" I have NEVER had that experience at any restaurant I've used coupons at. Additionally, she was EXTREMELY rude about it and not apologetic at all, making me feel like an idiot for even daring to think that she could accept it. Needless to say, I will not be coming back."	1star
I've been on the search for an Italian restaurant that serve good duck breast for a while now and I believe I've finally found a place. Basta Pasta is best known on yelp and instagram for their cheese wheel pasta, but I come to Basta for the duck breast! They usually tell you it takes 45 minutes for the duck breast, but it's usually more like 30 minutes. In the mean time, I would order plenty of appetizers and other dishes to snack on while I wait. The duck breasts are perfectly cooked with a little pink in the center. They're so tender that they tastes almost like beef! The cheese wheel pasta is also delicious. The waiter would 'wheel' over half of parmesan cheese wheel and mix fresh hot past in it before serving it on your plate with fresh basil and prosciutto. The combination is amazing, my only complaint that it gets too salty but it's hard to avoid with parmesan!  I would recommend making reservations given that they can get quite busy during rush hour!	4star
Quite disappointing. I don't know if the South Street Seaport area is a tourist trap or if we just got unlucky with the restaurant we chose. I hate overpaying for food that is bland and seafood that is not fresh (and whose lack of freshness is hidden under heavy tomato sauce). We didn't finish the mussels appetizer because they just didn't taste fresh. The gnocchi were mushy and lacked nuance. And the seafood in that dish tasted similarly off. In a city that is one of the world's food capitals, it sucks when a restaurant phones it in and skimps on quality.	2star
The owner of this establishment decided to insult my friend outside of his bar by calling her a very derogatory slur tonight. We were in there earlier in the evening enjoying our time and having s couple of drinks each. We left and returned later to walk by to another establishment when my friend walked by him and for some reason he felt the need to call her out and tell her she looked older than she actually is. This was unprovoked and on the idea that we would return later to close out the night. He had a man bun and an extremely arrogant attitude and it proved to me that this place is nowhere a decent human being would run his business.	1star
WOW to the CORN!!! is it corn season? because the corn was nice and meaty and super sweet. I ordered the Cuban sandwich that was good as well, just needed some green sauce but we ordered take out/didn't know that it didn't come with.  My friend order the chicken rice bowl. Not worth it, super small and not filling. Anyways will definitely come back for the corn or Cuban if I'm in the neighborhood.	4star
Our friends gathered here for a surprise engagement dinner. The team was so accommodating, even when the full party arrived in waves (and very late) and allowed us to order as we waited for the couple to get there. The whole team was very helpful and kept the place open as we took pictures and celebrated. Thank you for making the night so special for our friends.  The food was great too and the menu was filled with yummy vegetarian options.	5star
Came here for brunch recently and thought it was OK.  We did the bottomless option and were excited to hear they offer the traditional mimosa and Bloody Mary, but also a rosè sangria.  The sangria was pretty good but quite sweet - I couldn't drink more than a glass and a half.  The mimosa wasn't great.  It tasted batch-made and the orange juice wasn't the highest quality. My friends and I all ordered pizzas for our entrees.  They were fine, but nothing special.  On a positive note - we enjoyed the atmosphere and thought the place itself was nice.  The restaurant also wasn't super loud during brunch (as many places are), and service was good.  The brunch was certainly a good deal, but I'm not sure I'll be back soon.	3star
Made a reservation for 3 at 6pm on a Sunday. It wasn't as crowded as I expected. I kindly requested for the tables on the side underneath the gold drapes but they only allowed a party of 4 or more, but that was fine since every part and inch of the restaurant was decorated beautifully. We ordered: 1. tom yum fried rice - never had this kind of Thai fried rice, opted for mild spicy and it tasted great! 2. green curry - we asked for mild spicy too but it was spicy spicy, no where near the tom yum fried rice's mild spicy. Perhaps wrong order or the level of spiciness is different for curry. I love spicy but it was a tad bit too spicy for me.  3. kha nom jeen nam prig (vermicelli) - this dish's sauce was sort of similar to Malaysian nasi lemak's, which I love dearly, so I was very fond of this platter 4. Thai iced tea & Thai iced coffee - some Thai places make the iced tea too sweet, but this one was just right for my taste buds!  Overall, loved the atmosphere, decor, and food. Friendly staff - explained the menu for us after learning it was our first time here. Made sure no peanuts were in our food due to allergies. I read from other reviews they gave complimentary sorbet/ice cream, but we didn't receive any nor did any other customers too. However, we did get complimentary hot soup in a tiny shot glass. I'm not sure what it was, but it definitely had coconut and it was creamy. Would definitely come back again to Thai villa!	5star
"This review is way overdue, but my disappointment is so big I can't let EMP get away with it. I've been saving for months to treat myself with a dinner at EMP for my 30th birthday. We live in Charleston and made a special trip to NYC with my husband just for the experience. We chose the full dining and tasting menu, which for the two of us costed over a grand. As luck would have it, I got a bad cold the night before. Since the reservation was all prepaid and nonrefundable, we decided to go anyways.  Failure #1: Upon arrival I notified the waitress of my circumstances, and when she asked if she can start us off with a cocktail or something, I said I would really appreciate it if I can get some hot tea only. During the whole dinner I wasn't able to consume much of the wine pairing and I continued drinking tea, for a total of 4 small tea kettles. I ended up being charged for all four, for a total of $40 for 4 bags of tea and 4 cups of hot water, despite the fact I was sick, it was my 30th birthday and I already spent over a thousand dollars. Failure #2: The interior is disappointing. I understand they want to keep their authentic art deco appearance, but being a number one restaurant in America, and number three in the world, they definitely failed. It was even more accentuated with the fact that we went while there was still daylight, so it looked very bland and all the flaws were visible. Failure #3: The hot washcloth I received to clean my hands with had a huge brown stain on it and there were bread crumbs on the bench I was seated on. A restaurant of this caliber shouldn't allow flaws like this! Failure #4: Food was bad. Don't take my judgement for it as I was sick and couldn't really taste much, but my husband was very disappointed with the flavors. He said everything is was way too salty and lacked depth and dimensions. Was it the worst thing we ever had? Not at all, but this is the best restaurant in the US, which charges an arm and a leg, and they need to live up to the expectations! Failure #5: Food presentation was subpar. White food on white plates. lack of colors, lack of creativity, an overall disappointment.  Failure #6: Their Maine Lobster dish was totally tacky and not expected in a restaurant of this rank.  Overall, too many flaws and failures. It definitely doesn't live up to the expectations. My expectations were high, yes, as they are supposed to be as this is the number one restaurant in America, but they weren't unrealistic as I have been to a decent number of fine dining restaurants that tuned them and this one was supposed to top them all. This makes me doubt the credibility of all those ""Top xx Restarunats..."" lists.  Eleven Madison, thank you for ruining my 30th birthday!"	1star
We were really excited to try this restaurant.  -Arancini was nice. -Burrata Bruschetta was the best dish we ordered. It was fresh and tasty. -We also ordered Spaghetti Carbonara, Pistachio Pesto and Spaghetti Pomodoro. ALL of the pasta dishes were underseaoned, overcooked, mushy and sticky. The Carbonara was swimming in oil and it was incredibly sticky. The dishes look so pretty, but they were definitely not worth the price.	3star
So after reading a few reviews on YELP and missing Caribbean food I decided to try Veronica's kitchen. The reviews were helpful regarding the time to go. We went around 12:00pm and it was a small line. We both ordered the Jerk chicken, peas n rice,and mac n cheese. Too hot for her but the sauce wasn't the problem for me. It was the scraps of meat Veronica used and the price of the small platter. My platter contained a piece of a drumstick and what I think may have been half of a chicken back. The small platter is a small Styrofoam tray (normally used for a side order at most restaurants) and smashed together. Too small for $7 but I guess well suited in price for the Financial District. Also rice and peas were the worst I ever had. Completely flavorless my coworker agreed and threw it away. Mac n cheese was all cheese at the top and rest nothing but noodles but edible. I thought maybe I caught them on a bad day and decided to try again. What a mistake. I ordered the barbecue chicken which tasted so old I threw it away and was chicken scraps too. To add further insult to injury they were rude. Will never go again. So many better places in Brooklyn to get authentic, fresh, and most important delicious Carribean food.	1star
A great restaraunt neat Grand Central, it's got a great Sunday brunch with a limited menu - try the Hangover Hash! They also have drink specials to go along. You may want to get there before noon on Sundays because they get very crowded, and they strongly recommend reservations. They do have a large bar area, however.	4star
Love this place! The food is amazing, with flavors Our host, Nick, was the sweetest and treated us like royalty despite long wait times- big ups to him! (Gave one star less because the prices are ABSURDLY high)	4star
Hung out here last Thursday night, and had a great time. It's an establishment with history -- the bar is original (they moved it from their previous location to this new one). The drinks are great, and the bar staff and owner (who my friend and I met and chatted with for a while) are all really friendly and welcoming. The cocktails are reasonably creative, and there's a huge range of selections. I'm told their food's pretty good, as well; I didn't try it when I was in, as we'd already eaten beforehand, but would definitely consider coming back to give it a try. Generally, I think that most places in FiDi are pretty anonymous -- this place is definitely an exception to that rule. The interior decor, ambiance and overall feel are all very unique.	5star
Very nicely curated wine and beer selection, very generous portions of meat and cheese in a beautiful space.	5star
"Solid place for Italian and solid place to eat before a heading to a show.  Carmine's is literally ALWAYS packed, so def make reservations if you can. Or if you're a small party, seating at the bar is first come first serve.  This is your warning that everything on the menu is HUGGEEEE. Everything is served family style, which can be slightly expensive if you're only a party 2 (like we were). However, we had tons of leftovers. We had the chicken parmigiana with pasta on the bottom and a ""side"" order of meatballs. Chicken parm was on point and delicious, tender meat, good breading and not too thick, and covered with melted mozz. The meatballs was also fantastic, except a couple of the meatballs were lukewarm.  A party of four can have plenty of food with an order of an appetizer/salad (not both) and an order of a protein entree and add pasta. If you're out-of-towners or don't really have a way to eat your leftovers (you will have leftovers), still take your food to-go and give it a homeless person (we did!). They were so appreciative that they cried when we handed them the bags of takeout."	4star
If you have not tried their pizza with arugula on the top, you are missing out. It's so so delicious. It looks us a while to find this place because our GPS is just not working. We asked several people before we could find the place, and it was worth it.	4star
Very nice home feeling Thai cuisine. Nothing extraordinary special, but once in a while it is nice to have something that really stays true to its original flavor. The drunken noodle is a bit too mild, I would give it a five if they can kick the spice up a notch. Green curry with chicken is really delicious and have all the right ingredients in it. For someone who is not a big fan of egg plants, I find it extremely tasty in the green curry. Highly recommend if you feel the urge for a meal of simple yet delicious Thai food on any day.	4star
"Giving heads up: food is good but the staff is eloquently illogical and lazy. It is known to be busy everywhere on a Saturday brunch, waiting 20-40min is really average and understandable. How it works is that they will text you through their whatever system to let you know that the table is ready. This is not our first time at Two Hands, we are there pretty frequently because we literally live around the corner from the restaurant. Over an hour has gone by and we haven't gotten any texts so we decided to go inside the restaurant and see what's up. The girl is telling us that it happened to three people; blaming the system. I'm sorry but we saw girls already done with their food who were checking in before us.  Since we were near end the brunch time going near the happy hour, the place gets empty by 3:30, so we asked for a table by the window since there are so many empty tables AND happy HOUR IS COMING SOON. The hostess said that it's for the bigger party, ok fine. While seated, 10min later she seated a couple by the table for that so called ""bigger party"". Okay I don't get what's her problem, she already messed up with even calling us back and didn't even say sorry but just played blame game. Food was good like the usual. We usually end our meals with green tea latte. Guess what? The guy who made the GREEN TEA latte decided to top it off with F*CKING CINNAMON. It is sacrilege!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! At the bottom of latte we had pockets of cinnamon that looked like dog's #2.  It was so upsetting but we were way too tired to even bother with this whole thing. Let's not forget, we visit Two Hands pretty often. The usual staff is usually so down to earth! Even the waiter this time was so unpleasant, he acted like he got a stick up to his derrière so he couldn't be any nice and welcoming. But long story short, the killer was that damn cinnamon in matcha latte. To the guy who made it: how hard it is to mix green tea powder with heat up milk, there is no need of reinvent the wheel."	1star
The food is very well prepared and very delicious however I asked more then once to have staff take a picture and they have accessible nasty attitudes and say give them a second. They then proceed to stand in the corner and and stare me down not doing anything if your too busy why stand there and stare at me get the fuck to work. It never was like this here ever before. I guess I'll stick to the sister store next time for friendly service. The service was overall very unsatisfactory and I didn't even want to leave a tip. Not one time did someone come up an ask if everything was okay. Very pissed today	1star
Vinegar hill house, is home of the $10 pancake (yes, that is singular).  I was very interested in their menu but it is definitely more of a small plates spot and I left there starving. Had I known I would have ordered more. I love that they serve young coconut that you drink straight from the fruit, for $3 this far surpasses packaged coconut water.  I had a special, shrimp and grits which were delicious but also small. They have a beautiful backyard which is good to know about. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back but it is pretty neat how it is tucked away in this tiny corner of Brooklyn.	2star
If you've been reading recent reviews about the service at Gotham and are wondering if they are true, I would like to add an independent assessment and say yes it's true.  Went there recently and constantly had to flag down the server or someone nearby to get dinner moving along. This wouldn't be much of a problem if this place didn't have a Michelin star (2015) and therefore high expectations. But if I'm shelling out quite a bit of cash for this dinner, it better be top notch on all fronts. Otherwise food is great.	3star
What you need to know:  - Beautiful pan-Asian restaurant - great diversity addition to the area  - Good quality ingredients and nicely cooked but VERY EXPENSIVE for the amount of food.  - Review only for lunchtime menu, not good enough for me to return though  What we ordered:  - Chili caramel salmon market bowl $14 - Ordered with sticky rice, came with charred eggplant, roasted mushrooms and spicy bang bang sauce. The salmon was delicious! It was perfectly cooked - super moist! But it was only about 4 bites.  - Grilled ginger prawns market bowl $16 - Ordered with sticky rice, also came with charred eggplant, roasted mushrooms and spicy sauce. While the prawns were large, there were only two.	3star
I'm usually not one to complain about the cost of food.  $24 for a delicious (albeit simple and small) plate of tomato spaghetti is totally reasonable to me. $18 for a half cup of creamy polenta is also worth it (so good)! But $18 for 2 glasses of soda (each refilled once) was really absurd.  I don't recall ever being charged for soda refills at any fine dining establishment.  And when I asked for a refill, it didn't come until 30 minutes later when we were almost done with dinner.  At $4.50 a glass filled mostly of ice, it's just a rip-off.  My previous visit to Scarpetta wasn't flawless either.  We ordered off the restaurant week menu, and our waitress suggested a squid ink pasta substitution for a surcharge of $9.  Another Italian waiter stopped by to take our order and refused our order of the squid ink pasta as an entree substitution on the RW menu.  He said there was no such offer on the RW menu, and that we'd have to purchase a separate entree if we wanted the squid ink pasta IN ADDITION to our 3-course from the RW menu.  I was confused and didn't want to argue with this fellow, so we politely asked to speak to our previous waitress who apologized on his behalf and took our order of squid ink pasta (which wasn't that great).  I was very annoyed until the waiter kindly came back to apologize for his lack of knowledge of the offerings that day. These little things just irk me for some reason!	1star
Really inexpensive and delicious. The xlb are particularly good. Try everything. The vegetarian options also deliver.	5star
For years I've been wanting to visit Scarpetta because of the numerous great reviews they had, including the James Beard award nomination for best new restaurant in 2009, and also being a huge fan of Chopped and having the utmost respect for Scott Conant. Unfortunately, he cut ties with the restaurant recently, but that didn't stop me from wanting to visit this NYC staple for Restaurant Week Winter 2015. The exterior of the restaurant is rather inconspicuous towards the West Side of 14th Street, but once I walked in I noticed how classy-looking it was inside. The lighting was very dim and the noise level was moderate. There's a bar to the right of the entrance and some seats and tables next to the windows. For those seeking a more intimate dining experience, the dining room is straight to the back. As for the Restaurant Week menu, I felt there was a good selection to choose from. For the appetizer, I ordered the Raw Yellowtail. The Yellowtail was extremely fresh and I devoured that dish quite quickly since it was a very small serving. For the entrée, I HAD to order the Spaghetti since they were known for their pasta. The Spaghetti came in a nice presentation centered on a big plate. Although simple, the Spaghetti was soft and very flavorful. It was perfectly simple. For the dessert round, I ordered the Varlhona Chocolate Cake. I'm not a huge sweets fan, but the cake combined with the salted caramel gelato just melted in my mouth. It was DELICIOUS with the chocolate butterscotch cream on the plate. As for the service, the food came out very quickly. Considering how crowded it was, that was a pleasant surprise. Despite losing Scott Conant to other ventures, the food for Restaurant Week was still excellent and worth every cent!	4star
Edited 7/17/17: I took a trip to Thailand for two weeks earlier this year, so I thought I'd try out pure Thai again and update this review! Long story short, this place's authenticity is pretty good. My issue with the pad thai is still valid, as the tamarind sauce is still kinda sitting at the bottom. However, I did order pad see ew and it was perfect this time! Good char, not too wet. The noodles are pretty fresh, not made in house fresh sen yai, but pretty fresh. Also, I was so happy to see the condiment caddy with the roasted chili flake, vinegar, fish sauce. Although I was a little surprised that they do a chili sauce here like a sambal, rather than sugar, which is usually the 4th condiment. The som tam (papaya salad) here is only okay... the portion is kinda small for $10, it's good that they have the dried shrimp, but I don't feel like it was pounded at all and the balance was often - definitely a bit too sweet for my taste, not enough savory fish sauce flavor I became obsessed with sai krok isaan, fermented pork sausages, in thailand and when I asked the staff, they said they occasionally sell them as an appetizer special so I'll keep my eyes peeled! Specials rotate every sunday I believe they said. Nice staff --------------------------------------------------------- I came in with a friend around 5:15 pm on a Monday- no wait, not too crowded. Perfect. First off, I ordered the special appetizer which had quail eggs and chicken mince fried in a wonton wrapper. 6 quail eggs for $10, and literally 2/6 actually had chicken mince, the rest were naked eggs. Good taste, but a bad start over all. My friend ordered pad thai - he really enjoyed it but from my perspective, something was wrong. The noodles were far too wet. Even before he added the hot sauce, I could see that the noodles were visibly saucy.  I ordered the pad see ew - there was a decent little bowl of soup at the bottom of it. The problem is, pad see ew is also completely dry and should be stirfried! And as the Cantonese would say, there was no wok hei (breath of wok) here. The noodles were tender and fresh, but it just wasn't right. The beef was tasty but to cut back on Chinese broccoli costs, they gave me regular broccoli and ... cauliflower?! I kid you not. This was $14 as well. Overall, despite the very kind service and authentic Thai feel to the place, the food was good but over-priced and not well executed.	4star
I've been eating dinner in NYC for many years and am hard pressed to think of a better dining experience. The carpaccio is amazing.	5star
First time here and the restaurant was packed. I was craving Thai food and decided on this place with my friend. We ordered the shrimp pad Thai and the pad kee mao. The restaurant gives lots of shrimps for the pad Thai. Both dishes were delicious and filling. The decor was beautiful and waiters were nice. They also have upstairs seatings. The only thing I wasn't impressed was the B ratings for health inspection. Hope they get a A rating soon. Overall I had a great time here and delicious Thai food.	5star
"I have never been so miserable eating at a restaurant.  Arrived around 9:30 and was notified by the waiter that the kitchen closes at 10 pm. Everything that I wanted they were out of.. Just my luck. Decided to order the purple sweet potato fries, spicy tuna onigiri as an appetizer, my bf ordered the Nomad assorted sashimi, and I decided on the Godzilla and the yami yami. The sweet potato fries and spicy tuna onigiri came out first. The sweet potato fries were pretty good, but the onigiri was just TOO spicy for me to eat. It was not enjoyable whatsoever.. 15 minutes after, my boyfriend's food comes out, still waiting for mine. (Nobody checks up on us to see how we're doing, btw.) Another 15 minutes passes by and I flag the waiter down and I ask him about my food. He stares at me in shock and asks me, ""Oh.... you placed an order?"" He then mentions how he's sorry, but the kitchen is closed.. So I can't even order. At this point I am LIVID. I am so HANGRY it's crazy, but I keep my cool. To make it up to me, he asks if I want ice cream, I pass, but my boyfriend takes up the offer and orders green tea ICE CREAM. After a few minutes, the same waiter comes out and places a cup of HOT GREEN TEA on the table.... I'm not even mad at this point, I am just dumbfounded.. Safe to say, I starved for the rest of the night.  If you're on a diet, then this is the place for you! -__-"	2star
I'd never been to hometown BBQ before, and it didn't disappoint!  I went for a friend's birthday on a Friday night. From NYC you can take the ferry that goes to IKEA. It makes a stop there first, and then at red hook. Once you're off the boat it's only a block or two away.  We got there around 7, and there was a good crowd but not packed. You have to go up to order your food and then grab a table, so some friends had gotten there earlier, and grabbed one of the bigger communal tables for our group.  Since the table was secure I got on line to get some food. It smelled amazing right when I walked in (FYI the smell lingered on my hair and clothes the next day, which could be good or bad, depending on how much you like BBQ)  Browsed the menu that was up on the wall.  You could get just meat by the 1/2lbs, there were sandwiches, sides, tacos and banana pudding for dessert. I was torn between the pulled pork and the brisket tacos, but then I remembered this place is known for the brisket so I had to go with that. Also made a last minute decision to get a piece of cornbread since it looked so good!  They gave me the cornbread and a number, and said someone would deliver my tacos shortly. They arrived and were perfect!  I don't enjoy fatty meat, and am typically picky, but these tacos were great!  Three came in a an order and was served with queso, white onion and pickles. They served some jalapeños on the side, but I wasn't interested. The tacos were really good as was the cornbread. It was a big piece, that I shouldn't have finished, but definitely did.  We hung around till the place closed actually. We grabbed drinks at the bar, I did a pickle back shot, and when hometown BBQ closed I was ready to head home. No real convenient way to get back to Manhattan once the ferry stops running, but it was a quick Uber ride home. I definitely enjoyed this place and would like to come back soon!	4star
"I have been wanting to try Pig and Khao forever and finally got the chance to yesterday night! RESERVATIONS: Made reservations for 2 on a Thursday night at 6:30pm about a month in advance and had no issues.  The day of, the restaurant wasn't that packed so I'm sure a walk in would be ok. ATMOSPHERE: The inside is pretty small and narrow, dark with fairly loud hip hop music.  Very trendy and I could see this as a fun place to take a date or go out with friends.  There's a larger table in the back and then small tables for 1-2 people that are very close together.  There is also a bar area that faces the open kitchen.  You can see the chef cooking and everything.  The decor does remind me of Purethai cookhouse or other thai type restaurants where you have a bit of the Thai/Asian influence from a few decades ago with a slightly modern twist.   FOOD: Their famous off the menu item is their ""padcakes,"" which insider food made a special about.  Apparently they only serve them for dinner and could run out so I would ask before ordering. SISSIG - sizzling pork with a fried egg on top, the pieces were fairly crispy and reminded me of pork skin.  The dish was honestly only OK..it was a little on the heavy side with all the grease, but I guess that's what you get with fried pork and an egg on a skillet. COCONUT RICE - very good.  I don't even like coconut but this rice was good and helped to cut through the grease of the other dishes. JOWL - a little on the salty side (and believe me, I can eat very salty foods) but the brussell sprouts were pretty good.  The ""jowl"" pieces are thinly cut pork with about 2/3 fat and 1/3 meat.  Tender and pretty tasty.  This dish was also heavy and between the 2 of us we could barely finish. PADCAKES - $13 for 4-5 pieces, cut in little triangles.  It was OK...the pad thai noodles were overcooked and it was really spicy for me.  The bun part was good, it was like a crispy fried donut.  Overall though the flavor just wasn't there for me. Overall, atmosphere was definitely on point but the food was a little disappointing.  I guess Filipino food tends to be on the heavier/greasier side but I was hoping the flavors would blow me away."	3star
I haven't come across too many places as overrated as this one. The only great thing about this place is the ambience. Also since we were here for lunch on a week day the noise level was low too. The food was just about mediocre. I had the roasted chicken and my companion had a pasta. The portion of chicken was way too much - I'd specifically asked the waitress if it was too much for one person and she said it wasn't. Between the dry, flavorless chicken and the portion size I barely finished half of it. The pasta was okay but we should've have checked before we decided to go there if they had veggie options (that one's on us). But once they offered to make a pasta with tomato sauce I'd expect them to get the type of pasta right - we asked for pappardelle but got spaghetti. When we informed the waitress, they didn't seem to care.  I definitely would not go back here and would not recommend to anyone I know.	1star
The food was terrible. Ordered shrimp and they added some salt to the dish. The catch is that the when eating the shrimp it was like pouring the salt shaker straight into my mouth. Once I brought this up to the wait staff they laughed and dismissed the seriousness of my complaint. Moral of the story, don't buy the shrimp if you want to keep your cholesterol low.	1star
Food was not memorable. We did go in on a Sunday night, it was very slow so not sure if it wasn't the regular chef but the food was below average. Much better Italian in the area!	3star
"1400+ reviews can't be wrong. Wait, perhaps this time they might be... First off, I do have to say the space is really nice. It's not terribly cramped, and the outdoor seating during good weather just generally makes the place have a nice, comfortable ambiance. That being said, the value here is absolutely atrocious.  We started off with the deviled egg sampler. You get 4 ""halves"" for $6, which wasn't terrible, in relation to the rest of the items on the menu. Each half apparently had a different flavor profile, and it was very pleasing to the eye, but nothing really beyond your standard deviled eggs. Ended up ordering the roast beef sandwich as my entree, which came on two very paltry slices of rye bread, and a small pile of french fries. The food itself was fine, as the roast beef was tender, and contrasted well with the red onion and horseradish, but it was unbelievably unsatisfying overall, and I had to get a snack afterwards, even with the deviled egg appetizer. Oof. The service, in general, was adequate. I say adequate because we did feel pretty rushed for the most part, but our needs were generally met throughout the meal. It did take about 3 or 4 different servers to get our food out correctly, but in the end we did receive our food the way we wanted it, and it worked out relatively efficiently. Again, we did feel overall that the place was massively overpriced for what you got. $19 for that mediocre roast beef sandwich was rough. I understand the appeal, and the ambiance is really nice for a casual brunch or even dinner, but I'm not quite sure I'll be returning anytime soon. For a similar, but likely better experience, I would go to Bubby's High Line or even Cafeteria, which is at least a little cheaper."	3star
"Morimoto was so memorable that I had to come here next. Momosan definitely has a different ambience. Morimoto felt classier and more suited for dinner while Momosan would have been better for lunch. We arrived around 7:00 PM and waited for 15 minutes for a table at the bar.  Not too bad but it was a Wednesday night. We ordered the Kakuni buns ($4 each). Kind of steep for buns and it was nothing out of the ordinary. The bun and pork were soft but that's about it. I got the ""Large"" Tonkotsu ramen which is in fact a normal according to the waitress. Good to know because the large is actually smaller than your average bowl of ramen in the city. Although the size of the bowl may be similar, the portion of food is definitely smaller. Less ramen, thinner slices of chashu and no stamp on the nori like I saw done earlier when the restaurant first opened (kind of disappointing). The broth is rich and flavorful and much better than the hyped up ramen joints in NYC. The ramen was ""al dente"" and suited well to my liking. The chashu was average. Overall, I think for $13 you think you're getting a good deal on ramen but you're left hungry and wanting more so is it really worth it?"	4star
"One of my fav restaurants I have ever dined at.  Atmosphere: bar area is poppin as you walk through to get to the dining area. The blooms and seasonal decor is out of this world pretty-you can tell they put a lot of effort into their arrangements. We went during 9/11 weekend and they had orange blooms, peppers, flowers, twigs that made the whole environment so romantic. Service: Our waiter seemed like he had a keen interest in who we were and what we were celebrating, why we were traveling, etc regardless of if he actually cared or not, which I really appreciated.  It made us feel much more welcome as opposed to feeling like we were just another table to quickly turn. We explained that we wanted to try to the beef tartar but we really wanted the seasonal chefs menu too.  He said ""don't worry about it, I have an idea and I've got it covered"". He showed up and served the beef tartar as an amouse bouche! So Thoughful! Food: Amazing. Every dish I loved. Ate a pasta dish that immediately became the best pasta dish I've ever had in MY LIFE. The portions were perfect; we walked out feeling satisfied and not uncomfortably full in anyway. The Honey Angel bun breadrolls...just TRY to restrain yourself from devouring them with that goat cheese butter, I dare you.  SO amazing and the perfect way to sop up any leftover sauces from the dishes. I can't wait to come back here. Amazing experience."	5star
"We came here on a Friday night around 8PM. Ambiance - great music. The tables are pretty close and the place is pretty small. The servers were very friendly and if you never had or are new to Cuban food they will explain in detail (which we really didn't need.)  We had the maduros, pollo asado, moro rice, rice and beans, ropa vieja. The Pollo Asado and Ropa Vieja were both in the salty end. The Ropa Veija was cooked to perfection and melted in your mouth, it was just too salty. We also had the tres leches and I was not really impressed. For $5 for a slice, I could barely even split it with my friend.  We also ordered ""sangria."" Do NOT get sangria here. The server went behind the bar got a slice of orange and cherry garnish and put it in the bottom of the glass and poured wine on top. That is not sangria my friend. In sum, whoever cooked on Friday night was very heavy handed on the adobo. The portions were on the smaller side for the prices we paid approx. $16 for ropa vieja. I was not impressed and I honestly do not think it was worth it for the price we paid. **Also, they only accept AMEX  but there is a Bank of America across the street, a Chase bank down the block or you can pay a fee and use the ATM machine in the restaurant."	3star
The service was very bad and very disappointing. After waiting an hour the 4 of us went during their brunch hours. After looking at the minimal options on their brunch menu we then continued to ask for white meat in substitution for dark meat and was told the white meat would of be 6 dollars EXTRA on our bill in which their meal options were very pricey. After hearing the extra charges 2 of went to Sylvia's to see more affordable options. While the 2 of us went to observe the other options the 2 in the Red Rooster were kicked out of the restaurant. So, I conclude if you are ever in Harlem I highly suggest Sylvia's the food and chicken are very good, the service is much better, and the food is at an affordable price.	1star
This is a nice modern cozy spot for Korean food. The tables are close but bearable. Decor is modern. Food was delicious and presented really nice. Drinks were excellent too.  Prices are pretty reasonable.  My one gripe was that food didn't come out at the same time and servers were very nice but kind of scatter brained. I'd still recommend it though. Really enjoyed our meals here.	4star
They are close. Amazing decor. Food is a 7. Noodle Pudding in nearby Brooklyn Heights has much better pasta. But here you get the views. Service was attentive but waited almost 2 hours for table outside, but it's Saturday in August and 75 degrees so it's to be expected. Pistachio gelato fraudulent lol but hazelnut and blueberry sorbet very good. Oh and red wine list by the glass to be desired. Had a few, only the cab was good. Three and a half, rounding up to a 4 because I expect it will only get better.	4star
For me, the food is only three stars. But the overall Off-Broadway Theater District experience is four stars because of the cute space, super-attentive waiters, live jazz, great location and reasonable prices.  We weren't in the mood for the $30 bottomless pit brunch of all-you-can-eat small plates. Maybe if we went for that, I could give four stars. The individual plates are $10 apiece and only one out of the three we chose was a four-star.   The kale caesar was quite small and came with only a dusting of parm and no croutons. The sauteed asparagus with mushrooms and truffle oil was overcooked. But the house ricotta was a lovely scoop of fresh cheese drizzled with honey and some nice fresh bread.  Would we go back? Of course. Bea is a sweet incarnation of the former Le Madeleine. I'm coming back for more than the food, which was okay. (And maybe some of the other dishes are better.) Everything else about the place was lovely.	4star
Don't get the imperial seafood tower. I've had better in like 30 places, including Oyster Happy Hour at a totally average restaurant on Smith St.  French fries were good.	2star
This place is extremely overrated. The food is less than average. Please do not waste your time. It's only popular because the owner Marcus Samuelsson is on tv. I drove from Brooklyn to Harlem to check this place out and I can honestly say I wouldn't waste my time going back here ever.  It's that kind of place that after you finish the meal you try and find a reason that would make you come back then you realize there is none. If you want the type of food that this hyped up place should have been serving go to ( Sweet Chick) in Brooklyn. That place gets 10 stars in my book. Happy eating folks!.	1star
Absolutely yummy! I got the burger and lobster combo and had no regrets. The portion size are just right. The line can get crazy esp on weekends so there will be a wait.	5star
I could have made better pan fried noodles and yucca fries at home :(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:( And the portion for the price in entree atleast the pan fried noodles I tried was very less for the price And the chicken add on to the pan fried was pesto based and it didn't go well at all with the Chinese noodles. Bad fusion food too!	1star
As good as all the reviews say! This place is quite small so be prepared to wait. After about 40 minutes, our party of 4 still had to share a table with another group, which was fine, but tight. Good thing they have all those coat hooks on the walls. Totally worth it though! I ordered the Ratchaburi crab and pork dry noodles with handmade egg noodles. Omgz, everything was amazing. The crab was super fresh and delicious, the pork was really flavorful and moist, and all mixed up with the noodles and some kind of really light sauce that gave it just the right amount of moisture, it was perfect. We decided to spring for the pumpkin custard sticky rice dessert to share too - damn that was good. The rice alone was delicious, and the pumpkin custard looked almost like a baked bread pudding or something.	5star
The service here is absolutely terrible. We asked for warm bread and the server told us the kitchen was busy and couldn't give us it. We had to ask someone else and only got it 30 minutes later. Our food then took 45 minutes to come out. We asked so many times and they said it was coming, clearly it was not. Never again will I come here. The food was average nothing special, you can find this quality food anywhere. By far the worst service I have experienced at any restaurant. I also traveled two hours from central jersey for a nice dinner and this ruined my family's nights.	1star
While the aesthetics are a bit lacking and the lighting dim, we were soooooo pleasantly surprised at how delicious the food was!!  We really just happened upon the restaurant and we would recommend you try it too.	4star
"Aghast and annoyed.  I waited 1 hour and 53 minutes for my roasted chicken with a side of veg mash.   I made the grave error of ordering the beets as well, which were thrown in the container with the chicken and veg mash.  Had I been a more experienced Yelp ranter, I would have had the presence of mind to take a photo of the monstrosity that I found on opening the container.  The veg mash looked like potpourri and the chicken was a beet-bloodied mess. Perhaps the best is the delivery guy's statement on arriving, ""I am sorry it is so late, BUT, it's not my fault""!  Indeed, good sir, thank you for clarifying. Take a memo Mulberry and Vine management team - call Danny Meyer stat, you have a culture problem on your hands!"	1star
Best ramen shoyu I've ever had. The broth was so smooth and rich, but not salty at all. The pork slices was very fatty, and soft. I prefer it less fat. For appetizer we got the omon... and the clams! The sauce that goes with the clams was very refreshing, made with fish sauce and lime. It was nice to have a Vietnamese touch in a ramen shop. Unfortunately the u and I (clever name by the way) was sold out and so was the mu ramen. Id suggest going early on the weekend.  Everything was a bit pricey, so you're paying for  a great  atmosphere and great ramen.  My chef friend in nyc said she prefers this over totto or momofuku so I went with this place for my ny visit. Our wait on a Sunday night was about 40 mins, with cute bars around that didn't bother us.  Ps we asked the hostess what was their playlist, but we couldn't find it. If anyone can pm me if they know, that's be great	5star

"Came here for dinner on a saturday night and within the first 10 minutes of arriving, I could tell it wasn't going to be a great experience. We were 'greeted' by the front of house, who didn't give eye contact, and after mentioning that we had a table for 2, she proceeded to ask ""is your entire party here?"" as the both of us continued to stand in front of her. If she'd cared to look up, she would have seen we were both there. After that, we were then asked to wait in the 'waiting area' that didn't exist for 15 minutes while our table was made to be ready - despite the fact we had a reservation. Now I understand that things happen and places can be unforseenly busy - however they didn't even apologise or reference the fact. Anyway onto the food - had wings and ribs for starters which were average. The meat was kind of dry and didn't come apart from the bone particularly easily. They were also caked in sauce, so much so, there was a pool left swimming on the plate. Mains, I had a fried pork cutlet with sweet potato mash. Again, the pork was quite tough and lacked flavour. The veg were also over cooked and overall the dish was nothing to write home about. My dining partner had the Jambalaya, which was topped with massive shrimp and bits of sausage. It looked great, and definitely one for the gram, but again - shrimp overcooked and flavours were poor. Because the food was so average, naturally we didn't finish and asked to box up the remainders. We were given boxes and left to box it up ourselves..which seemed a bit weird. Overall, really would not recommend."	2star
"Ah yes I've finally made it to this popular brunch spot. I thought that overall the food was ight, not mind blowing but good food. I ordered the ""Eggs in a Nest"" (roasted pork, sunny side up egg, potato hash) which was was OK. My friends got the ""Benedict Johnny"" which which was very different since the grits are crispy and in a square shape. I thought this dish looked tasty and in hindsight I wish I ordered it.  What really impressed me with this place is that you get a complimentary cocktail (limited to four) with your brunch entree. These drinks were not afterthoughts either, they were made very well and very strong. The prices are fairer than I would have imagined. Only thing I can add is that the decor was very plain jane...get it? Plain jane? ba dum tss."	3star
Sunday, October 1, 2017. My boyfriend and I arrived for brunch just shy of 11:00am. The place was lively but no where near crowded. We are seated shortly after we arrive.  Other than having our water glasses filled, we received absolutely no attention from waitstaff . If the restaurant was full to capacity, this would be slightly understandable. However, that was not the case today. We ended up leaving after 15 minutes of being ignored.  I'm still in shock about the abysmal and unacceptable service we experienced this morning. I've eaten here several times in the past and have experienced way better service, even when the place has been significantly more packed than it was today. One thing I do know for certain: I will be spending my hard earned money at establishments on Cortelyou where I am positive that the customer service is decent. Because that is definitely not the case at The Farm.	1star
Wow ! Best duck I ever had !!!! This stuff quacks me up !!! Lol Oh the dessert was awesome !!!! Chocolate, coffee, cappuccino ice cream!	5star
Due to the poor service, the food became incidental.  We were seated quickly, and placed a drink and appetizer order.  Shortly afterwards we ordered our main course and then needed to organize a search party for our waitress.  Thank goodness for the busboy with whom we placed additional drink orders, asked for more water and the check.  Could this be because we were 2 women of a certain age.  If only the waitress could have known the tip she could have gotten. Won't be back. There are far better places on City Island.	2star
As a resident of Greenpoint, I have been to many restaurants in the area. Glasserie was always on my list and I have finally experienced it. In my opinion, Glasserie is the best restaurant in Greenpoint. The atmosphere is beautiful and the music being played in the background is great, its mostly 90's hip hop. The wait staff are very knowledgeable and are happy to explain everything on the menu. If you go here, you must have the griddle bread with labneh, it was amazing. I also had a cocktail called the smuggler that was great as well.	5star
A swanky old world cocktail bar with retro black and white hexagon floor tile, intimate, dim lighting located in Brooklyn Heights that offers Happy Hour and small plates.  After attending a poetry reading nearby hunger pangs strike hard as I was enticed for a cocktail and some small plates.  Upon arrival the business appears small similar to a café size.  I was the sole customer after thirty minutes upon opening the business on a Saturday evening, ergo I was serviced immediately.  My server George was prompt, polite, attentive and made suggestions for cocktail.  Manhattan cocktail is listed in their menu which is an essential basic since the drink originated in New York City in the early 1870s.  Happy Hour is available everyday for cocktails only.  The bill is submitted to the customer embedded in a wine cork with the business's postcard- innovative and a fresh outlook rather than the standard traditional black leather guest book. Mexican Mule $8.00- tequila and sliced jalapeño and ginger beer crushed ice with fresh lime served in a highball.  Drink was ok, nothing to boast for greatness as it was too much crushed ice than the drink main ingredients and I am not a fan of jalapeño.  I did tasted the ginger beer. Truffle Fries $9.00 -roasted garlic aioli with mayo and ketchup but disappointedly no sea salt.  The portion was abundant which can be shared.  The fries appears very burnt.  In the NYC French fry scene, the golden rods from Pommes Frites are covered in sea salt and served in a white paper cone while competitors use parsley and chives but, disappointedly, The Binc uses neither. Pastrami Tacos $14.00 - three short rib pastrami tacos covered in mustard seed aïoli, cornichons, and cilantro with fresh lime.  The meat was extremely dry and somewhat stale or not fresh.  I prefer pulled pork rather short rib.  The cornichons (pickled cucumber) were microscopic small and mustard seed aïoli green spread or sauce was very minimal as I was unable to swallow for the blandness.  I like the soft shell of the taco. Note:  The Binc opens late either 5 pm or 6 pm because they close at 2 am in the morning.  Visa and MasterCard accepted only for credit/debit cards.	3star
Food: average Korean chicken place I'd say 3.5/5 But my review is mostly for the awful service we had tonight. First, the reservation we made online wasn't even honored because apparently their boss handles that but their boss didn't tell them. Okay then maybe don't do online reservations if you don't even acknowledge them? Second- our waiter (Korean man with long hair) just seemed disinterested the whole night and whenever we needed something we had to holler him down or holler other staff.  Third- A girl that brought out our chicken hit my friend in the head with the plate.  The last and worst thing that happened was towards the end of the meal. We had bought my boyfriend dessert so we asked if they could bring it out because it's our friends birthday. We told them we gave it to the front and that it says Frenchworkshop on the box. Our waiter said okay and left. So we got the bill and they cleared our tables and everything but they weren't bringing our dessert. So I pretended to go to the bathroom and I told ANOTHER waiter and THEN he brought it to me. I opened it up and it was fucking FLIPPED! He handed me the box upside down and when I looked inside I couldn't even tell what dessert it was because it was smushed. So appalled at the lack of care they handled our dessert. Tldr: okay food but service was super shitty and they brought out the dessert we had bought upside down and smushed	2star
"I recently had to write an autobiography in six words, so I'll write a review in six as well: Absolute pure class with amazing food My friend and I came in on a random weekday night after magically managing to snag reservations the night before. The night started out rough, with my friend thinking she had lost her wallet. Despite us not ordering food for about an hour while my friend frantically called every number available to try to locate her missing wallet, the host was incredibly polite and checked in to see if there was anything he could do. When my friend located her ""missing"" wallet, in a bag pocket, they acted as if we hadn't just held a table for an hour. They also dealt with our incessant questions and requests without a hint of contempt or impatience (which often happens at restaurants like Babbo). We placed our orders (3 pastas between the two of us, one of which we split), and when there was some confusion, they again dealt with it as politely as possible. Like I said, pure class. Onto the food itself. You can't go wrong with any of the pastas, but my favorite was the gnocchi with the braised oxtail. The gnocchi was light and pillowy and the oxtail was tender and oh so flavorful. And despite being stuffed, we ordered two desserts, the cheesecake and the semifreddo. I know the cheesecake gets the hype (it's made with mascarpone instead of cream cheese), but do not miss the semifreddo. It's airy and creamy at the same time, and just the right amount of sweet. A week later, I still dream of this meal."	5star
This was my first time trying Korean BBQ.  The overall experience was fun, but the food was really flavorless and not filling.  It was also super expensive.  The service was great and the restaurant was not busy for a Saturday.  Perhaps it would have been a better experience if we went with someone Korean.	3star
Wonderful concept to have a bunch of Italian grocery stores and food court built all into one! And you can have some wine while you're at it. Every turn you make features some local ingredient or product from Italy. The fruits look so fresh and appetizing.  The food court is located in the center. You can purchase any item you see in the store with any cashier you see in the whole site, even the individual vendors themselves.  Note to future self: don't try the side gelato from the coffee area. Go to the actual gelato parlor where this is a line for it.	4star
Possibly the worst seafood I have ever had. The prices are misleading and we were drawn in by the specials, however by the time we got our check we were better off going to Sammy's which is our usual spot.  There was an odor lingering in the air of musty carpet, other customers complained of a cat smell and asked to be moved. The heat could have also been turned up a bit more.  As for the food... The salad was wilted, veggies soggy and the clam chowder gritty. I've had better canned chowder then what was served here. The butter with my lobster was not butter I can't even say it was margarine as it had a lemon taste to it and was simply oily. That's if I had lobster to dip into the fake butter since my lobster appeared to be anorexic. The fries if you can call them fries because they were broken up pieces were over cooked and barely enough for a child's menu I'm not sure how they have the nerve to serve it for $21 with shrimp. The shrimp was flavorless and the calamari was the smallest little pieces I've ever seen. We left hungry and disappointed  We couldn't wait to leave and I'm not sure why there is always a crowd waiting to get in. We figured crowd=good/fresh food, we were sadly mistaken.	1star
"A pale imitation of a BBQ place you might find in Williamsburg, Astoria and other ""hip"" parts of the city. I really, really wanted to like this place. I wanted it to have such great food that my friends from the other nabes would be dying to come out here. I wanted it to be so good I could save myself the headache of MTA subway and bus hassles to get to Brooklyn or Manhattan for some foodgasm-inducing indulgence. Maybe my expectations were too high, but this place is all decor with so-so food. Hubby and I arrived early, just as the place opened, and because there were few customers at 5:30, the service was quick. We loved the wooden beams, the smoky wood, the huge bar area and the ambience of the lamps.  But the food? Read on, brave reader: We ordered the Korean sticky wings appetizer - these were delicious and if we had stopped there, my rating would be five stars. But then I ordered a BBQ half chicken and hubby ordered the Baby Back Ribs. Surprise! Like the Soup Nazi in the old Seinfeld show, he told us ""no ribs for you!"" - a common complaint I've read in other reviews. If anyone managed to actually get an order of ribs from this place, please let me know so I can give you a flag to plant on Mount Foodie. Disappointed, hubby ordered the brisket instead. When the food came, he said his were ""OK"" while my BBQ chicken was drowning in so much sauce that I had to play a ""find the chicken"" game. When I finally got hold of a drumstick I found it was a little pink and bloody - and I asked the waiter if this had been properly cooked through. He looked uncertain but agreed to take it back. Then the manager came over, looking worried, and explained that, because it's a ""farm to table"" type of place, the chicken was going to look a little raw because...uh...it's been freshly killed or something. Uh-okay...If that's true, I'd rather have ""farm to NYC Department of Health approved"" than ""wannabe hip restaurant to Elmhurst Hospital table.""  Finally the chicken came back after another round of suntanning. The waiter was apologetic, so I shrugged and scraped off more sauce so I could see again what I was eating. It was bland, so I assumed it had been cooked through. After asking the waiter to box most of my chicken up (as it turned out, the leftovers were pretty good after I reheated them in my own oven), he suggested we order dessert, some S'mores mashmallow Boy Scout thing. The minute we said no, check please, his smile disappeared so fast our heads spun. It was like watching a great actor suddenly walk off the stage and slip into his pajamas. ""I was hoping the bad reviews were wrong,"" hubby said. ""Me too,"" I said. Unfortunately the mixed and bad reviews are there for a reason."	2star
"WMM (Worth My Money) Rating 1star out of 5 Disappointed !!! Ordered a whole pie of their famous Artichoke pizza simply because of the 3000+ yelp reviews. I thought what could go wrong, all the pictures seemed awesome!  When I got the pizza an 1hour and 15 mins later and all the cheese fell to the side of the pizza. - Basically an avalanche of cheese sauce on the side of the box- so presentation 1 out of 5. - The sauce may be good to others but it reminded me of store bought Alfredo sauce lined with butter, and some artichoke. Extremely salty too, which gave me a massive headache and stomach ache after eating it. The bread is almost non-existent since the cheese and sauce are over whelming. 1.5 out of 5. - The bread I can say was the best part -  thicker than usual pizza in NY but baked nicely 3 out of 5 All and all, I can see how people might like this type of pizza but to me it was not the way I like it. Messy, Salty, extremely Creamy, and horrible delivery service.  Sorry I wasn't feeling the ""Hype"" about this place!"	1star
While meeting my partner in NY during his work trip we finally made it to Buddakan, a restaurant I had wanted to visit for some time. You can imagine my excitement when he and I were able to get last minute reservations just a couple of hours prior. Everything about this place exceeded my expectations: the ambiance, the food and the very knowledgeable and attentive service. We can't wait to go back!	5star
"The pretentious service really ruined our night.  I came here for a few friends for dinner.. One of them was late so we had to wait for her arrival before getting seated. Idk if it was the New York mentality, but when I asked the maitre d if our table would be cancelled if we were late for our 6pm reservation, he sounded very annoyed at my simple question. He said it was fine as long as we left before 9:30pm for the next reservation. 3 hours? Seems fine.  We were 5 girls and we wanted to share some appetizers and order 5 different main courses. At first, one of the servers only provides us two big empty plates for sharing as a ""fend for yourself"" type attitude? A second server came by with smaller plates for each of us, which we appreciated.  For the actual food, it was good, but wasn't amazing. I was expecting more for my first NY fine dining experience. I really did not enjoy the buttermilk budino with the red velvet apricot for dessert.. It was too tart. It's probably the worst dessert I've had for fine dining.  What really ruined our night was when one of our friends had brought a small cronut from home for us to try. We ate it out of the box it came in along with our other desserts that we ordered. When we were about to pay for the check, the supervisor came and immediately wanted to change the check, saying there is a plating fee for the cronut. We were like uh ok...? Never heard of a plating fee before. I was joking with my friend that it will probably be like $30 (thinking it would be the max).. It was $75 for the plating fee. WTF. We mentioned to the supervisor that we had the dessert out in the open for probably half an hour.. And no one told us or warned us that there was a plating fee. If there was, we would have immediately put it away. Servers looked at us and didn't say anything. The supervisor blamed us for not telling them in the beginning, which we didn't know we would have since it was a surprise from a friend, and kept repeating that that is the policy and is customary of restaurants (sorry first time hearing this.. Guess im not fancy enough?). Also saying they would need to put the dessert on a plate for us.. Which they didn't even do. So what plating was done?! We had to ask to talk to the general manager before it was taken off the bill. The server apologized and seemed to want to let it go. But the supervisor wanted to make a mean buck off of us villager girls."	1star
I've been waiting 2 hours for my delivery order, and their staff's only response is to offer to cancel it. If it was the first time I'd experienced this I'd give them two stars. The food is so inconsistent. The customer service is a nightmare. It's just not worth it. Go somewhere else.	1star
My coworkers talked highly of this place so I decided to check it out with my mom. It was 7pm on Wednesday and we were seated at the last empty table. We ordered Dungeness crab and shrimp boil with spicy garlic butter sauce ($50) and it was simply incredible. The spicy level and the chunks of garlic made the dish perfect and I ordered a bowl of rice so I can mix it with that delicious sauce and it more. Thank goodness we didn't order any appetizer because we were full after finishing the boil with extra rice. I'll definitely come back and introduce this place to my friends! Make sure to bring enough cash. Evasive this place accepts cash only!	5star
I went here they told me to wait 35 minutes which I did by the bench and after 40 minutes and seen other people served I asked what place in the waiting list I was. Well even tough I said it and I spent 40 minutes in that bench they said my name was not there. And then they said another 20 minutes. That is not nice	1star
You go here for the ambiance and to be seen. The interior is gorgeous and the food is actually better than expected. However, $15 or $16 for 3 normal dumplings that are inferior to 2/3 of the Chinese places in the city? The fuck? Clearly Buddakan is the 8 who thinks they're an 11.	4star
I ordered their stuffed grape leaves via Seamless.  I didn't find out how many grape leaves come with a single order for $8.50, and it turns out the magic number is 4.  $2+ per stuff grape leaf is a rip-off, plus they didn't seem any better than the canned kind I enjoy from the store. The grape leaves also come with a yogurt-looking sauce not mentioned on either their Seamless or online PDF menu, so it does not appear to be vegan :/  If I'd known, I would have specified no sauce or just not ordered. I'm not sure about their other items, but I'm not certain I'd order from here again anyway, given the prices.	1star
Ok. So. This place has been awesome.  Great food and great service.  Today however, I came in for lunch. Not sure what has happrned but things are not the same.  We asked for the fries to be crispy.  When they were served they were mushy.  Didn't say anything . We asked for more bread for the guacamole we ordered. It never came.  Asked for it again and we got bread that was hard as a rock. Clearly over toasted.   Then the avocado toast came out and again the toast was too hard and inedible.  When asked to speak to the manager we were told that they were not here.  Needless to say we have recommended this place to many people. Now will be telling them of this experience.  Disappointed	2star
"I'm actually surprised by these amazing reviews. Maybe I did something wrong. Was it the fact that I ordered takeout? Was it the fact that I called during lunch time (which is always very busy)? I don't know but while bitting into the very bland noodles I thought to myself "" WHAT ON EARTH DID I DO WRONG"" to deserve such bland Thai food when I was craving it!?  Reviews like this sadden me because other reviews were so good and then there's mine. Sorry! Working in NYC gives me more options then I would like. On this particular Thursday I was craving Thai food.. scratch that I was dying for some Thai food. So what other way to look at what's int the other than search right on YELP. With a rather quick search I saw the crazy good reviews for this place and said why not give it a try.  I ordered through UberEATS and my food was here in no time and I was getting ready to devour this meal (or so I thought). My chicken Pad Kee Mao was so bland! There was no taste whatsoever. Now, I've done my far share of Thai restaurants and I'm putting this one dead last in about a list of 15. Sadly, I just rather not even give this place another try because I was really let down by their first attempt to lure me in as a habitual take out customer, etc.  Disappointed and sadden I will never get the time I spent eating this tasteless meal."	2star
Overall OK experience. Food is really what you pay for so just keep your expectations bit low and you will walk away happy. As usual the waiter and person at the counter have a grumpy face and attitude. I guess it's now a default for most restaurants to have waiters who have grin on their faces. I didn't stay for desert as they were rushing everyone out pretty much the moment you end your main course and manager just immediate ask then to throw the bill at the table.  This place is really small so even when you go with reservation you will be sitting way to close to other party and can over hear the the entire conversation.	2star
We made a reservation, but still waited about 20 minutes. That wasn't a big deal because it was a nice day and we sat on a bench a few buildings away. The food was great. We got the fried clams appetizer followed by lobster roll. Too much food, but all tasted great. We could have skipped the fried clams (I was full after eating it!). The sweet potatoe fries were a nice side to the lobster roll with an abundant amount.	4star
Tbh this is place is so overpriced. The food is mediocre. The customer service is shitty. The fries are over salted (so ask for no salt) tbh, HARD PASS. $27 for 1 meal? Lmao no thank you. I mean maybe go there for an Instagram pic but that's it.	1star
Had to wait an hour and cut it a bit close before going to our Broadway show afterwards, but it was worth it.  All of the dishes had such good and complex flavors.  It's a small spot and we were rushed in and back out, but the food was good. The papaya salad and chicken wings were pretty standard but well done.  The wok roasted chili with shrimp was delicious; great heat but so much more than just spice.  The ratchaburi crab and pork dry noodles were also delicious.  The dish was a little bit sweet, and the preparation reminded me of Cantonese noodles with the roasted pork; it was a good fusion dish.  We also tried the Ayutthaya beef noodle soup (special of the night), which had a bit of a tart broth and lots of goods, including beef balls, tripe, short rib, beef loin and strip. We also tried another special curry of the night, and the flavors there were also spot on. Overall, everything was enjoyable, and maybe I'll have to add this to the Seamless rotation to skip the wait.	4star
For a casual, flavor-filled meal in a cozy, unpretentious atmosphere, Traif is wonderful. I stumbled upon all the great reviews on Yelp and took my boyfriend here.  As it turned out, he already had this bookmarked for us to try (yay, me!). We walked in on a Thursday evening without a reservation and were immediately greeted and sat at a table in the back garden room.  It was comfy and rustic, with slate floors and a glass enclosure.  A few 4-person groups were around us, audibly enjoying themselves but not so loud as to disturb anything.  Two groups were raving about their food-- always a good sign. The menu was pretty pork-heavy, but had a bevy of non-pork choices, all with interesting ingredient combinations.  As a non-pork eater, I appreciated the variety and we were quickly able to select several plates to share. The server brought a complimentary amuse bouche of watermelon gazpacho.  Slightly sweet, tart and herbacious-- a refreshing start to the meal.  The four plates we ordered were each sent out at different times as they were ready, which allowed us to pace ourselves and savor each. What we had: Heirloom Tomato Salad - with goat ricotta, fresh berries, wild basil, shaved jalapeno and crispy shallots.  Such an unexpected combination and so delicious.  The perfect medley of savory, tangy, creamy, spicy and crunchy with a hint of sweetness.  I could have eaten three entire plates of this. Salt and Pepper Shrimp - with grilled pineapple and sweet potato, in a sweet and spicy sauce.  An excellent quartet of flavors, especially if you like saucy dishes.  This one is heady, tangy, pleasantly sweet with a little bit of smoke.  We drank the sauce afterward.  Don't judge. Short Rib Sliders - Perfectly braised, impossibly tender short ribs, pulled and enrobed in a mouthwatering BBQ sauce laced with smoke and brown sugar.  Topped with melted cheese (muenster, maybe?) on a lightly toasted bun.  My boyfriend said there were crispy shallots on his.  I didn't detect them on mine.  The accompanying fries were hand cut, skin-on, nicely browned and crisp with generous salt and rosemary flavoring each bite.  We added an extra slider to the standard order of two.  The standard order would have been enough. Porcini Gnocchi - with mushrooms, tender corn, porcini sauce and grated pecorino.  Excellent.  Gnocchi are one of those things I always like trying but are rarely executed well.  These were pillowy soft with a creamy (not doughy) texture that was complemented well by the crunch of the corn and the buttery, savory sauce.  And pecorino because, cheese.  I was really excited to eat the leftovers for lunch the next day, predicting that the flavors would meld even better overnight.  I was right. Service was amazing.  So down to earth and attentive.  Everyone was super helpful-- we were even aided by another server when I wanted to adjust my drink and our server was taking another table's order.  Our server was always pleasant and checked on us numerous times to see that we were having a great experience.  This is what it's about. Our only regret was that we were so full that we had no room for dessert.  I REALLY wanted to try the Green Tea Panna Cotta and the Key Lime Tart.  I will probably be thinking about the prospect of it until the day I get to stuff my face with these. Bravo, Traif!  We will definitely be back!	5star
Disappointing BBQ, while there are so many delicious joints all over the city. I won't be back. Their pulled pork was under seasoned and I couldn't taste a trace of smoke. Their coleslaw comes in plastic containers and did not taste fresh at all. It wasn't cheap, either.  The only thing going for this place is the outdoor picnic-style seating area.	2star
A very cute restaurant with super delicious southern food! Everything looked so good that my friends and I ordered most of the dishes and just split it all. We ordered a half portion of fried chicken, the biscuits, the tomato salad and the mac and cheese of course. My favorite was the biscuits and mac and cheese! We came on a Wednesday night and the place was pretty busy. The restaurant itself isn't very big so it felt very packed at times.	4star
Mm mm mmm absolutely delicious! Full disclosure: I've only had food delivered to the office and never visited the storefront.  HOWEVER, I have been ordering once a week for the past 2 months now. Same order - roasted vegetables and the spicy rice cakes - every.single.time.  Let me tell you about these spicy rice cakes. Most spicy rice cakes you get at the market or other restaurants are boring - the rice cakes are generally covered in the same sticky, gochujang sauce but only a few sad pieces of carrots. Those also tend to give me a stomachache because of how dense/processed the rice cakes are. Barn Joo totally ups the rice cake game! The dish comes with tender and flavorful bulgogi, nutty almond sunflowers and chunks of squash. Everything complements each other so harmoniously. We have a saying that when something is so good, it sticks to the bones. I taste this saying every time I eat this dish. The roasted vegetables are so healthy and hearty, with brussel sprouts, acorn squash, broccoli and cauliflower. They also have that deep, roasted flavor with a good blend of spice to complement and provide a buffer against the spicy rice cakes. The two dishes are enough for two meals, which is a huge bonus! Love love Barn Joo!	5star
Excellent drinks. I tried the Toast and Marmalade and the passion fruit  Caipirinha.  Both were delicious. Also they have a a dollar oyster happy hour which is very good. The food is decent bit I normally visit for the drinks. The service is attentive and professional.	4star
So much I want to love about this place - the food, the ambiance, the proximity to our home - and yet every time we've been here we've been horribly disappointed. Simply put, the service is beyond terrible. There's more attitude and entitlement among the staff than the chicest restaurants in NY. After our food took more than an hour to arrive, the waitress Sara, and Manager (blonde woman in her mid 30s), became extremely rude and defensive and argued with us over when we placed the order. For the record, we were the 10th group to be seated on Father's Day, and we were there with our toddler. We ordered an appetizer, two coffees, and two main dishes. We sat patiently for over an hour while large groups all around us received their meals, finished, and paid. When I asked the waitress if she had an eta 30 minutes after we finished our monkey bread, she became flustered and defensive, saying she's doing the best she can and didn't know when it would come. 10 more minutes passed and we gave up. I brought my credit card to her and just asked for the bill and the food to go. 10 more minutes and out comes the manager with our plates of food (no bill or credit card), and she immediately starts in on how it was our fault for the delay and that she looked at the tickets and it was only 10 minutes longer than normal. I again asked her for the food to go as our toddler was getting tired, and she rolled her eyes and said fine. 10 more minutes and she brings us a $66 dollar bill and our food without so much as acknowledging that we had a poor experience. Honestly, 15 years in New York and I've never been treated so poorly. The least she could have done was comp the appetizer or offer us a gift certificate for another time. Instead we left with our food and a $70 bill and will not be coming back. I live around the corner and will make it my mission to share our experience with our friends in the area. Colonie owners: this is a friendly neighborhood, please please train your staff to provide better (at least less argumentative) service. You have good food, but at these prices, we expect more. Unfortunately you've ruined our Father's Day and taken our favorite local place off our list of go-tos.	1star
Had dinner here last night with my Mom and two kids (ages 12 and 14).  First off, this place is LOUD inside.  I had the Park Burger and a la Cart fries,  both good, not great.  Son had Mac n cheese in skillet, which he devoured.  Mom claims Cobb salad was best she's had her whole life.  Daughter had chicken cesear with no comment, but she cleaned the bowl.  Despite noise and crowd, service was fast and friendly.  We made a reservation on-line which was honored.  Didn't break the bank.	4star
Came here with 2 of my friends last Spring after seeing the buzz over on Instagram and Yelp and we decided to check this place out. Surprisingly, we didn't have to wait on a line for a long line despite what everyone else said. Maybe that was because we came toward the end of the first intermission?  We were seated promptly and our orders were taken rather quickly. I settled for the spicy seafood ramen. I thought his dish was mediocre at best and nothing else really stood out to me. Meh.  Service was ok. At least the utensils were cute? My bowl was accompanied with a wooden thingy that they used to serve customers with.  Would I be back in the future? Probably not.	3star
This is a favorite stop of mine every time I come to NYC.  Extremely welcoming staff, great food, great service and a warm and welcoming decor.  We didn't have a reservation the fine dining area (need to reserve about a month in advance), so we had a cocktail and waited for a table in the bar area. Didn't take too long.  Excellent cocktail, nice vibe, delicious food.  Note: there is not tipping here (included in the price of the food/drink), the result is a staff that goes out of their way to make you happy and feel welcome.  Great place.	5star
Very good vibes here, always. Upstairs they have this lively cool bar, which you can socialize and have a drink with your friends. Downstairs is the other bar which is more quite and intimate. It is always awesome cocktails here... The Cotton club is the best of all. In case you want to have a dinner, Food is also good and tasty with some quick bites like a hamburger.	5star
Wow. It was so good! We got the Thai iced tea, pork buns, pad Thai , and veggie Thai red curry. All amazing. Spicy but some of the best pad Thai we've had and we tried a lot. Awesome location, nice outdoor seating, and efficient wait staff. Reasonable price! It looked like a lot of people did takeout so that's a good option. Would definitely go back. (instagram: @foodfotografia)	5star
Tight but welcomed seating so you can enjoy your bowl of soup while it's still steaming hot.  Expect plastic tableware, bowls and plates.  Had the oxtail soup, specified mild for level of spice, no cilantro, and it was truly delicious.  There were 3 bones with tender meat though the amount was not nearly as abundant as the flavorful broth or chewy noodles; enough to satisfy any appetite.  It's a unique, fun experience if you're trying hand pulled noodles for the first time as I did on a recent Fri. for lunch.	4star
"I don't know why it's so difficult to get good Thai food in BK. And this was no exception. I ordered (through Seamless) the Pad Thai Goong. The rice noodles where a gelatinous clump. The ""sauce"" was bright red and grainy. There were three overcooked shrimp. And it was loaded with chili flakes. Completely inedible. The pork dumplings were ok. So disappointing.."	1star
fried chicken was good, a classic properly executed, moist and steamy inside but nothing to brag about it, nice woman behind the bar	3star
Robertas oven baked. The classic margarita pizza. Vegetables grown straight from their garden where we ate. Slight acidity in their tomato sauce and can't go wrong with that gooey cheese. You can opt to buy it for take out then carry it next door and eat it in their garden which is very chill. They've also started serving $6 softserves for their summer menu.  Once famous for Beyonce storming out of the place after an argument w Jay-Z.	4star
I was just here and literally threw my drink in the trash on the way out.  Super sugary and artificial tasting. The boba is disgusting. No texture no flavor.  My friends milk tea tastes like water or how if you let the ice melt in all your bubble tea. He too threw it out, just not right away because we were still in disbelief.  Sorry guys. Pretty decent service but your drinks suck.	1star
Da Claudio NY Manhattan FiDi 8pm Sunday 20th December 2015 Four Stars We enjoyed a reserved table for 12 in this small uncrowded Italian restaurant for Willie's birthday. We drank a couple bottles of reasonably priced Chianti Classico. The service was bit slow but probably because of the size of our party. I ordered the Lamb Ragu ($21) with Garganelli instead of trofie. which had very little tomato in comparison to the ground lamb. It was quite flavorful and filling. The pasta was al dente and quite enjoyable. The place is a good value for Italian food.	4star
Worst ever. Do not eat here. Staff is completely uneducated and place smells like wet rags. Bathrooms are disgusting. Horrible management. Even worst food.	1star
So, if I were to have written this review a year ago it would have been 5 stars. 6, if that were possible. This was hands down one of my favorite places to eat. The food was delicious the service was great and the prices are well below the average spot on Franklin. I had recommended this place to quite a few friends and organized many dinners here, birthdays, etc. Overall I was very pleased.  Over the last 6 months I have seen a dramatic change. The service is now terrible. I get that you are busy but ignoring your guests is not a good tactic. I can even forgive bad service if the food is amazing. However, the food is unreliable. It never tastes the same. The only thing that is consistently good is the Caesar salad. Overall, I am sad to say, I think I am over this place. I really wanted to like it, but after multiple bad experiences in a row I have to cut my losses.	1star
"Wow, Yelpers. You really let me down on this one- and in NYC of all places! I expected better from these reviews. In short, beyond horrible Meixcan food (if you can call it that). The longer version? I'm pregnant and craving Mexican food. We wanted something authentic and with flavor, so we saw the reviews and walked the 20+ blocks on a nice Saturday night to the restaurant. It was small, but packed, so we were optimistic. From the previous reviews, we knew about the ridiculous $11 guac and the $5 charge for refills on salsa. The salsa was good, but not worth a $5 refill. Also, the margaritas looked amazing, but as I'm pregnant, I could not partake.  So we ordered our food. I ordered the enchiladas verde and my husband ordered some other unmemorable chicken dish. My dish had no flavor and was pretty bad. Part of my order choice was because it mentioned shredded chicken- of course, there was very little shredded chicken and it was mostly chunks of dark meat, which is a cheaper alternative. The beans were straight from a can and whole beans (not refried as stated on the menu) and the rice was dry and gross. Majorly disappointing. And I'm not sure why this place gets such good ratings. Maybe the margaritas are really good and people can't taste the food by the time it arrives? We didn't have the automatic gratuity added to our bill as mentioned in several reviews, but the owner was sure to give us multiple business cards to ""tell your friends."" This was majorly tacky and also ridiculous to do unless you're absolutely sure the customer enjoyed the food.  Overall, we wish we hadn't wasted our Saturday night here as it was a total bust. Save yourself the money and go anywhere else."	1star
Had a great late night dinner while walking along Smith Street visiting bars on a Saturday night.  The server at Uglyduckling was friendly and helpful.  Great food and beer.  We enjoyed the 10oz stuffed brisket burger and the filet mignon.  The steak was tender and grilled to perfection.	5star
Found this place after strolling around Battery Park. Lobster rolls?! YES PLEASE! I really like lobster rolls but there aren't too many places in LA that serve it.  I came in and ordered the lobster roll, lemonade, and for the cole slaw. The cole slaw is vinegar based, so it's on the tart side. It's almost like picketed cabbage. The lobster roll was great, it had actual prices of lobster chunks and claw meat still intact. Most places just chop up the lobster and over charge you for what it is. I think here it's fairly priced. It might be a west coast thing, but I wish the entire roll was warm. Even served cold, it was still delicious.  The employees were super nice as well! It's a small little place and it's pretty neat. They even have a bottle opener that catches the caps when you open your drinks.  TIP: try the blueberry root beer. ITS SO GOOD.	4star
Location, view and ambiance were great but the food was not worth the price. $14 for a glass of orange juice and $19 for a mimosa?! The food is bland and nothing spectacular. I enjoy fine dining but $200 for breakfast for 3 (1 child) is a bit much.  I would recommend this for a pre-drink in the bar to enjoy the view and hit up somewhere else for food.	2star
A M A Z I N G pizza!  By far the best pizza I had while in New York! WHAT A GEM of a restaurant! It has a second floor for seating.  Before leaving NY to make my way home I wanted to make sure I came here for my last meal! I got an original pepperoni pizza and a hot chocolate I know weird combination but I needed it for that weather.  The pizza did not take long at all, the server was very friendly.  This place is a must if you want New York style pizza.  I came in on a Tuesday evening and I didn't have to wait at all.	5star
"All aboard the Joju train-Destination: Delicious Banh Mi Sandwiches. Ordered the Bulgogi Banh Mi with added ""da bomb"" egg, the Original Joju Sandwich, and loaded Kimchi Fries. Cashier girl looked really serious and charged me two extra sandwiches by accident. But since the bill is on the screen I just told her to quickly correct the mistake. I'm not big on anything spicy; the fries and the sandwiches could be tweaked to lower the spiciness. Bulgogi Sandwich tasted so good, with the right amount of marinade beef and tang to the carrots on top -Perfection. The original sandwich tasted like any other viet sandwich, nothing special to comment. The Kimchi fries was a bit soggy and flat even with the Sirhacha Mayo on the side. Definitely coming back"	4star
Kind of can't be bothered with going to this place again - condescending door lady, slightly overpriced, unexceptional drinks.  Felt compelled to go while in the neighborhood after hearing about it & despite living just a mile up Greenwich, rarely come to Tribeca, so stopped in for drinks.   With a little research and/or intoxicated stumbling around, there are plenty of other places not too far away that I can count on as superior alternatives.	2star
Walked right in on a Wednesday night with no reservation. Decor is super cool and the restaurant is spacious. The service was too much. Our waitress came back every 5 minutes or less to make us order drinks, make us order food, make us get more drinks, etc, she was just very over whelming. We left after one round and ended up at a bar next door where the service was more chill.  The hot salsa was too thick and sweet and the tacos were not up to my standards. It wasn't good enough to be authentic Mexican and not better than the $2 street tacos.  Pass!!!!	3star
My friends and I decided to check this place out after learning that it was going to be participating in restaurant week. We were seeing a play earlier in the night, so we had a later reservation at 9:30pm and were able to be seated right away. Since we were all pretty hungry and wanted to try as many dishes on the menu that we could, we decided to order almost every dish on the restaurant week menu and share them: Bread basket (5 stars): That bread is some of the best I've ever had--so tasty and cooked perfectly and even had some warmth still on the table.  Appetizer Raw red snapper (3.5 stars): Good, but not amazing. The touch of citrus was nice, but otherwise was a pretty plain dish. Creamy polenta (4 stars): Easily the most exciting of the app options, but still not as amazing as I was hoping it would be. I felt like the polenta and the mushrooms did not quite come together in the dish and seemed like two independent ingredients. Spring salad (3 stars): About as plain as a salad can be. Don't bother ordering this unless you really can't select the first two options. Entree Spaghetti (4.5 stars): So simple, yet so delicious. You'll be hard pressed to find another pasta like this one in the city. Zucchini mezzaluna (4 stars): I really enjoyed this dish as well as the pasta was super fresh and delicious. The only critique of this dish was that we couldn't quite understand the anchovy butter as a sauce as it did not really complement the flavors of the pasta very well. Roasted chicken (4 stars): Another solid dish, though I liked the same plate at Chefs Club better for their restaurant week. This one was a bit smaller and the skin not as crispy, though the veggies were decent. Dessert Coconut panna cotta (4.5 stars): I really enjoyed this dessert, especially on a warm summer night. The flavors really popped (especially the guava) and the texture was perfect. Creme fraiche cheesecake (4 stars): The cheesecake was pretty good, but the star of the plate was easily the granita--damn was that tasty. Chocolate cake (5 stars): I feel like they undersell this dessert by calling it a cake because it is absolutely delicious. It is so soft and creamy and practically melts in your mouth and the combination of butterscotch and caramel ice cream is divine. Overall, this place serves up a solid menu for restaurant week with the courses getting progressively better as it went along. The ambiance and service were both top notch and the food was exceptional. Definitely worth checking out.	4star
Why has it taken me forever to come here?! Popped in on a rainy afternoon and the store was empty, score!! Great shop with a wide variety of products ranging from ham, cheese, sausages, and lots of prepared food. I went in knowing exactly what I wanted and ordered a 1/4 pound of serrano ham, 4 pieces of tortilla Espanola, and one other tapas that was cod on bread. Also picked up some cans of tuna, which is amazing and puts American tuna to shame. Everything was delicious. One thing to note, it seems like they don't take orders for the tortilla in the late afternoon. I wanted to take an entire one home but the guy said it was too late, so I had to take individual pieces. That is the only bummer. Will def be back.	4star
Today I went to hometown BBQ after thinking i lost all hope in most ny BBQ... this place has changed everything.. I have to say over all place is a 10 I tried a little bit of everything and and it was all good the Korean sticky ribs are a must have. The lamb belly was amazing it's a little oily but it belly how could it not be.. and where else can you get lamb belly.. not once have I seen that any where... I got here around 130 line took about 45 mins but it well in to the first room where you walk in... the wings were also very good nice and sweet when you start and that spicy come in way after... the potato salad does do a good job of cooling it down. And if your not a mayo person it takes more like a great German potato salad would I do it again most def can't complain about one thing I ate or the Service	5star
So let's start off by saying the food is so good!  I booked my reservations for 9:45pm on a Saturday night cuz it was the only time available. I actually arrived late due to busy traffic. They were understanding and allowed me to keep my reservations. This night the place was packed, I waited for a table for 5 for a good 45mins to an hour. When I checked in, the gentleman understood that my full party was not in due to reservations being for 7 but my party was taken down to 5. After waiting 45 mins I asked to speak to a manager, whom I got the pleasure to speak with Amanda. She understood where the confusion was and so did I. I was seated within 5mins. Due to misunderstanding they had treated us to a complementary bubbly and starter dish on the house. ( that was a nice gesture ) ..  Now to the good part, food! I'm not into Asian cuisine but it's like there was a twist. Our waiter recommended since it was our first time for all, that whatever everyone orders it should be shared. Being said, the minute the food is done the food comes out. The serving size for each meal, you can say is for one but it seemed like appetizers (if that makes sense). So we did as that. There was so much varieties on the table it's like we got the whole menu lol. My three fav dishes were; The Oxtail Dumplings, Crab Sticky Rice, & Short Rib and Scallion Pancake! I read plenty of reviews on the dumplings and it is a must try.  Cocktails. I had the Royal, not so pleased with it. It taste like Champagne and it's not. Another drink on the table was Exhale, I personally didn't like it and my friend was not so thrilled about it neither. Overall experience, really enjoyed myself. Due to arriving late and nearly waiting an hour to be seated, the staff made up for it. Side note: it's a dimmed light spot like everywhere even bathrooms.	5star
"A spin on a traditional and it's a good one!  It's rare to have something as delicious as the original to be enhanced and have a positive result. Trust me, I've seen (and tasted) some ""wild"" creations out there and they were just not palatable.  Anyway... back to JoJu, they are amazing. If you're in the area, grab a bahn mi or two. I can't say I'm a big fan of their drinks but I am definitely one heck of a fan of their contemporary Viet sandwiches! And as if they cannot get any better by spoiling us with yummy sammiches, they offer a loyalty card!! Aww yeah, guess who is returning to this badass joint :D Wish this place is bigger, and while we're at it, I wish this place was in the city. Joju is tiny so be considerate and exit the establishment once you're done eating. Also, don't be a jerk by leaving the place a mess. I know, I know, there's no polite way in devouring a bahn mi but seriously, if you're gonna be dropping everything onto the table then at least wipe the area post-inhaling. You wouldn't want to sit in someone else's filth, right? Right. Besides, you ain't no pig :)"	5star
The food here was pretty decent (I got the BBQ chicken mac & cheese), but our server was MIA for majority of our dining experience. It took her almost 20 minutes to come back around after she boxed up our food. Even then we still had to ASK for the check, instead of her just knowing it was about that time for us (I mean we declined her offer for more drinks and had nothing left on the table... shouldn't it be obvious?) Not in a rush to come back... but then again FiDi isn't really my 'hood of choice.	3star
I heard and read a lot of good things about this place. It's part of the Totto chain so it has to be good right? Unfortunately, it was way overhyped to me. Everything was so overpriced and just didn't really hit the spot. I went to Japan last November and any Yakitori spot would destroy this place. It was great that they offered some unique offerings that is hard to get in other restaurants (e.g., tail, neck). Must Have: - Chicken Liver - Chicken Meatball - Ewl Good (although super overpriced)  -  Ebi - Eggplant - Sushito peppers with chicken Forgettable - Udon - Scallops	2star
IMPORTANT FIRST NOTE: they only take cash!!! Food was excellent and there wasn't anything not to love, I got the seafood cavatelli and it was out of the park. SOOO delicious. The Octopus appetizer was also delicious and has me skeptical but was out of this world. Can't believe I am saying it was delicious! Must get the tiramisu, and you will settle down in heaven. They take reservations and accommodate big parties, though sometimes they may ask your party to order family style, depending on how busy the restaurant is.	5star
The staff are very friendly, the service is attentive and the decor and ambience is pleasant. Unfortunately the food is weak and I would rate that as 2 stars. There are better options in the neighboring areas	3star
We were here for my sister's birthday, 3 stars only for the food and ambience were great. However, service was very lacking that needs a lot of improvement. our entrees took forever to come out after we finished our appertizers. We waited for a good 20-25min for our main courses to made it to the table. We were hungry and sipping on drinks. That was unacceptable On the side note, they do charge  2.50 each person if you want to bring in a cake wow.  I have been to many restaurants for friend birthdays but we have never been charged for cake cutting fees. We wouldn't mind if the service was good but it wasn't. Our waitress seems unfriendly and unwelcoming.	3star
very slow kitchen took an hour to get our orders and then turned out they got my wife's order wrong. The portion sizes are too small and the food quality is sub par. So overpriced with lower quality and slower service	1star
2 stars because it seems like I may be missing something - everyone loves this place but I don't know why - we even ran into a girl in line who said her boyfriend eats there a few times a week and swears it's the best Cuban in NYC...  We got the Baja tacos, the Cuban sandwich, fries, mojito, a regular margarita and a frozen margarita. The Cuban was pretty good, but I was shocked so many people thought it to be the best in the city! The Baja tacos were bad, overstuffed with unflavored cabbage, overly fried, unseasoned rice on the side. The mojito was ok, not bad actually, kind of in a little glass but a unique, fresh flavor. The frozen margarita - which everyone seemed to be drinking- was terrible, as was the regular margarita. Neither were strong at all and both were very salty. Sad!  The seating is extremely close and awkward, you are practically on top of each other. Seems like the take out area has a totally different menu but it's more chill (only sells beers though, no cocktails), and a total hole in the wall.  With four stars and 2500+ reviews, I really feel like I'm missing something here!?	2star
I read great reviews for this place on Yelp, so I figured it wouldn't hurt to swing by before leaving to the airport to go home. We came on a Sunday afternoon and the wait was only 20 minutes (surprisingly), I don't even think we waited the entire 20 minutes, we were seated much quicker than we'd anticipated. This was a clean and spacious little gem in Chinatown, service was not terrible either. My husband and I shared the crab and pork soup dumplings, the shrimp and chive dumplings (the wrapper was green!), and the Szechuan wontons. We went to Joe's Shanghai last time and it didn't live up to the hype. However, my husband loved the crab and pork soup dumplings at Shanghai Asian Manor, but my favorite were the Szechuan style wontons - the sauce is to die for! Super delicious and well worth the trouble getting to Chinatown to have a taste.	4star
Way overly priced and overly hiped for the portions you get. They claim is family style. We order the pork shoulder/pork belly for 4 tiny pieces of pork mainly fat and an additional $3 for rice REALLY.  Do not order the duck salad it's  extremely spicy and it taste like fish sauce. Unable to take another bite we left very disappointed.	1star
Best lobster roll ever!!! The crab roll and the shrimp roll are on the salty side but lobster is just right!  The soup is at ok level but rolls are AMAZING! No lines at 5:45pm on Labor Day.	5star
Came in for Sunday brunch and was pleasantly surprised. We got the dumplings, beef and broccoli and maduros and eggs. They were all delish (especially the maduros &a eggs) and the service was great throughout. Would definitely come back for an easy brunch in the Chelsea area!	5star
"Made our way in here after a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge. Located right next to Grimaldi's, both places have lines out the door. I don't think the time of day matters because this place seems like it's busy all day and everyday. My group of five ordered two salads, 2 small pizzas, and an order of meatballs. Our arugula salads were fresh but overdressed. The meatballs (3 per order) were moist, tender, and had a healthy amount of tasty gravy. The pizzas were that perfect combination of crispy and chewy with just a touch of char from the coal ovens. Looks like they boast some of New York's best egg creams but we opted for bottled cokes (little bottles).  Service was very friendly and prompt but we were not given enough settings/silverware and had to wait for them while our food was on the table. We also had to ask for water refills and when our server refilled waters the pitcher was leaking water all over our pizza. He saw it and we brought it to his attention but he just said ""Sorry"" and wouldn't stop pouring the waters,via leaky pitcher, over our food. My friend instinctively put her hand underneath to stop our pizza from getting soaked but another one of us finally moved our food out of the way since our server obviously didn't care. Seriously guy? One extra body movement or even having us hand you our glasses would have rectified that easily..but hey I guess water logged pizza is acceptable. Despite the service hiccups we thought the place was a great little spot.  The host was delightful and made sure we all took the right trains and went to the proper subway stations since we were going in three different directions. Thanks for the transit help. I'd recommend it to friends who are in that part of Brooklyn."	4star
This place is beautiful! The bread is fantastic and the complimentary marinated olives are simply amazing!! Unfortunately it eas VERY hot inside. I know we are in summer but seemed like the a/c wasn't working. Then we get our entré and I thought mine wasn't as great as it smelled. It needed more salt and the shrimp was over cooked. But I have to say that the fresh pasta had a beautiful bite to it. I could've put cheese on my pasta but I don't like to do with seafood. My friends really enjoyed their meals. One of the kids had dinner (the other already had dinner), he enjoyed it. They also had vanilla ice cream served with a biscotti and they loved it! Service was very good!	3star
It's about time I finally came to this place! It's been in my bookmarks for the loongest time and I just never had the opportunity to go. Finally got one when I went to catch up with a friend. We got to sit inside the restaurant where it was quite warm and menus were given right away. The servers are friendly and not pushy at all. Even though we spent a while catching up before placing our order, the servers didn't rush us at all. Both my friend and I got the seafood spaghetti from the lunch menu. Woww we did not expect that much food. About 75% into the dish, I felt REALLY full and didn't know if I could finish the spaghetti but I at least finished the seafood because it's seafood. They were seasoned pretty well and cooked well too (the clams, shrimp and octopus). The sauce is a bit heavy but delicious as well. Didn't have the stomach to try anything else on the menu but if I'm ever in the area I'll surely give the fish a try. The bathrooms  are quite tiny but it was clean which is the most important. You do have to go into the kitchen area to find it.	4star
"The Quick: Food is very good, service is non-existent, and it's pricier than other dumpling options in the area. Not bad but I would choose Auntie Guans any day. The Details: I'm  a big dumpling fan. I love going to Chinatown and spending a dollar for five dumplings, trying all of those 'hole in the wall places' where no one speaks English. After hearing of excellent dumplings success downtown, I was excited for its opening.  Overall my experience was ""meh"". The dumplings were definitely good, but overpriced with that hole in the wall nonexistent service. The Combination just didn't make sense. I would try to again if her friend really wanted to go, otherwise I would go elsewhere for dumplings The Damage: ~ $8 for 6 dumplings"	3star
This place is so adorable and obviously has potential. I came mid afternoon on a Monday so business was practically non existent and the service was therefore slow. I overlooked this factor since the server was nice and I've been in the industry for a long time so I understand how it is. Having said that, the one thing I cannot get over is the fact that various members of the staff including management openly commented about the bad tip that the recently vacated table had just left. Since I was the only guest left in the restaurant, I could clearly hear every word. The first thing that I was taught working in the service industry is to NEVER discuss other patrons in the earshot of guests. Besides this faux pas incident, the food was beautifully presented but needed more flavour. I'm willing to give this establishment a few more chances on different days and times but I'll never forget this first awkward experience...	3star
Do you like unique places where you feel like you are a part of the party and can just enjoy yourself?  Do you like it when a place has no pretense and good food when you are drinking any night of the week?  How about when a place that plays decent beats so you can bop a bit ? No? Cool. Because then I don't want to see you here or read your whiney reviews .  I've been here a handful of times in numerous states of inebriation and its just a good time feel good environment.  Don't get me wrong the food is pretty dope, but I'm here to have some fun on the DL.   The other reviews say it all   and this place is just an awesome spot.  End of story	5star
I went here last year and was god. I came back 2 weeks ago and I didn't like anything.  Really, anything. Artichokes too dry. Mushroom too salty. Kale supposed to be sauté but was kind of undercooked salad.	2star
For my 100th review, I have to review the first place I ever tried a Cuban sandwich. The first time I tried this place out was in 2010. I remember sitting at the bar (because it was packed as usual), and ordering a Cuban sandwich recommended to me by one of my friends back in VA. As I was ordering, a local had mentioned that I should definitely order the corn. Trusting his judgement, I did. What a great decision. The food came, and after the first bite of my Cuban sandwich and corn, I fell in love. You always remember your first time, right?  Ever since 2010, I've made several visits to NYC and always made my way to Cafe Habana. And every time, it was fantastic! The servers are so nice and friendly, and the food is just so delicious. I'm one of those fellows that doesn't like pickles, but this sandwich makes me love them.  Over the years I've tried Cuban sandwiches from numerous restaurants, and nothing comes close to Cafe Habana. Something about the way they cook and grill their sandwich just makes it so none inimitable. If you ever find yourself in SoHo, make sure to try them out! The restaurant itself is small, and there may be a wait, but it's definitely worth it.	5star
There's a reason Momofuku has the reputation it does. They know how to deliver an amazing dining experience.  I popped in for lunch the other day and everything I ordered was outstanding. From the fried Brussels sprouts that were crispy and tangy to the pork belly buns that literally melted in my mouth: I couldn't think of a better place to spend my afternoon. On top of that, the service was prompt and friendly and the man behind the bar was more than happy to offer recommendations and explain a few of the things I sought clarification on.  I will certainly be by again and I highly recommend everyone else do the same.	5star
Edit: Came today on Mother's Day, expecting them to be busy. I made a reservation for 1:15pm and the rest of my party was a few minutes late (about 10 minutes- I ordered a drink in their absence). It wasn't packed at all and there were several servers on, several large tops leaving.  Upon my friend being seated, we proceeded to wait SEVENTEEN minutes before our waiter finally came over and greeted us.  He looked our way and several times wasn't even serving other tables, but didn't greet us at all.  When he decided to come over, we promptly put in our food and drink orders, he delivered my friends drink and he never came to our table again.  He never checked on our meal and did not return with the ticket. I had to ask a busser for it and ask that busser for it to be picked up and run.  We were 100% kind and polite the whole time.  Our waters were empty, our drinks were empty and we were completely forgotten.  According to our ticket his name was Alex and I won't be returning because of his lack of service or at the very least, inability to transfer our table when he left mid meal.  So disappointed that I had such a poor time at what was once my favorite brunch joint. Original review: One of my favorite weekend brunch places in Manhattan- lovely decor, delicious food, and really good $5/mimosas and $5/Bloody Mary's during weekend brunch!   They also take reservations, which is nice.	1star
This place is busy! Party of two came without a reservation and were seated in about 30-40 minutes which is not bad. We were sat by the windowsill and while it was not the best place to sit, I was okay with it because I was starving at that point. The service was great and the waiters were super friendly and helpful when we were indecisive on what to get.  I ended up getting the lamb burger with sweet potato fries. For $17, the burger was pretty small and it wasn't that great honestly. It wasn't bad but I've had much better burgers before and I felt the same way about the sweet potato fries. It wasn't a bad brunch but it wasn't amazing.  Would I come again? Probably not.	3star
"Kung pao monkfish is absolutely one of the top ten dishes I have ever had. The monkfish - a hideous beast in its living form - was morphed into this crispy sweet mildly sticky florette if you will. Then two seconds after a bite the heat hits you """""""""""" if they aren't using Sriracha I was fooled. Awesome . Oxtail dumpling had an earthiness I wasn't expecting. Nice and hearty but spiced well. Black cod was a sweet glazed piece. Nice char to the fish and perfectly cooked. This cod is on every Japanese restaurant menu but not prepared to this perfection. An awesome surprise and a highly recommended dish if you want something memorable but also safe if you are worried about trying stuff you might hate. For us, this is a place to try all the different weird dishes you would normally pass. The most advantageous depiction of westernized Asian fusion I have experienced yet. This is a must have and must have many courses. The three things above were just my most memorable....."	5star
Nice spot to hang out and have a meal. I wasn't wowed by the food but it's a nice location to hangout. The calamari wasn't as crispy as I hoped, it was very chewy... Not a good combo. If you want atmosphere this is your place. If you want great food, you might do better elsewhere.	2star
I had brunch here before attending the nearby pride parade. I was not disappointed. There are times where you have a familiar dish prepared very well, like a burger and fries at Shake Shack. Then there are times where someone has innovated on a familiar dish to turn it into something completely different and wonderful. The banana French toast at Extra Virgin is one of those times. When I first bit into it, I was reminded of the first time I had bananas foster in New Orleans. It did not taste like a French toast. It tasted like a sweet banana dish.  The toast is super crispy on the crust and super juicy on the inside, as it's thickly cut. It's also topped with a very generous helping of whipped cream. I highly recommend this place and consider this the best French toast I've ever had.	5star
"This Saturday we went to Gargulio's to celebrate my sister's birthday. My son, a police officer who was injured on the job had just had major surgery and was unable to put pants on over his brace. The owner told us he was unable to eat at his restaurant due to the dress code which does not allow shorts. There were at least 3 women who were wearing shorts, as well as a boy. All of them were welcomed and seated without comment. When I questioned him on this he said, shorts are the same thing as skirts. Therefore, women are allowed to wear them. Then he proceeded to say,(sarcastically)"" If your son chose to wear a kilt, that would work."" After a great deal of back and forth, we were seated in a back room, secluded from the rest of the patrons. We tried to make the best of it, but I will NEVER go back there again! The food was ok and overpriced."	1star
I've been wanting to come here for awhile and when I heard that they were going to close soon, I had to come right away! When we got to the restaurant, they said it was a 45 minute wait, but it went by relatively fast. I ordered the chicken and waffles with a cornbread batter and dark chicken, and it was really good, especially with the hot sauce and maple syrup . Also the mac and cheese jambalaya is amazing!!!! I love it so much, I would definitely recommend it! It was really busy when I went, and I did feel like the staff was kinda rushing us, but otherwise, they were really nice.	4star
Came here twice and loved it both times. The $12 happy hour wine flight is unbeatable. I have tried the full-bodied white wines flight and the rosé flight. I thoroughly enjoyed two out of three of the wines in each flight, which is not bad!  The food is great as well-- the second time I went, my friend and I shared the crostinis plate, which featured 6 different crostinis. We enjoyed most of them, but next time I'd skip the one with the goat cheese and the one with the eggplant-- the flavors were way too strong for us. We also shared a ceviche, which was tasty but nothing to rave about.  I would recommend making a reservation, as it can get quite crowded during happy hour. Overall, it's a great place to bring a date or a friend if you're looking to impress without breaking the bank. I love trying new places, but I would not hesitate to return!	5star
"I have been meaning to try this place for a while and I always walk past it and was happy to know that my husband made reservations here for dinner. The place was much bigger than I had anticipated with also a very cool ""outdoor"" area which is actually inside an industrial complex. The service was quite slow but we were not in a rush so that was fine. We had a stroller and they were pretty cool about it, though they don't have a ramp so be prepared to carry the stroller a few flights. The drinks were ok, nothing special. The food was however quite delicious and everything felt very fresh and it was Mediterranean in a very cool unique way."	3star
Food was decent, service was horrible!  Waited 15 minutes after sitting before anyone poured me water or even spoke to me again and even then I had to waive them over like I was drowning. And I really despise having to do that, seems rude on both ends.  Once I got water my food and apps came all at once and even at that was just alright nothing mind blowing which made me kind of sad. I'm writing this as I sit here waiting for my check....which I also had to loudly ask for from across the dining room.  Needless to say I am more than disappointed, waste of an evening off and a lot of money.	1star
first of all customer service terrible & owner nightmare on elm street my food was terrible chicken black & hard my salad was terrible and the avocado was black on top a customer was eating and saw what was going on told them stop giving me a hard time about order  she said she will pay for whatever the salad cost we both left out i would never ever go there again it sucks!!!!!	1star
I grew up with L&B's. It was a weekly treat and it was always good.  Throughout the years, I would still go to L&B's even though I've moved out of a Brooklyn.  Now that I'm back, it seems things have changed at L&B's.  The prices are still reasonable the the size of the Sicilian slices are like half of what they used to be.   The taste is still good but it's just a bit upsetting that the slices so small now.	3star
We came here for dinner last Monday.  Service was pretty good and the food was ok.  We sat in the front of the restaurant and it was a bit dark and dated. They serve garlic bread and some veggies when you sit.  The food portions are huge and you will probably have leftovers.  I got the fried seafood combo which was huge plate which l found it to be just average.  It (like all other entrees) came with choice of soup or salad and a side.  I opted for the new england clam chowder which was pretty good and the pasta with garlic sauce which was unique and also above average.  The seafood consisted of filet of sole, calamari, scallops, one soft-shell crab and two shrimp.  The scallops and shrimp were my favorites and the rest was just ok.  The shrimp were HUGE and if I were to return I would definitely get something with more shrimp. My husband got the prime rib special which was only $20 but in my opinion it was not even worth that.  He added on a broiled king crab leg for$8.99 and that was amazing.   These entrees together with a pina colada and two beers came out to be about $100 which I found to be too much for the overall quality of the food. Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes and I would give them another chance.	3star
I dined here a few weeks ago (4/24) with my husband for our wedding anniversary. Oh boy, the regrets. I'd recommend not making a reservation here, that only guarantees you'll be squished onto a small table and while you watch poorly dressed walk-ins sit on the table you requested (and definitely forget about sitting outside with that reservation). That aside, we were sat quickly (7pm reservation), on one of the two tops on the left with the long bench. That bench is a lawsuit waiting to happen. Not only did it rock and sway with every small movement any of the patrons sitting on it made, but I actually had several splinters stuck in my dress and legs. I had to go to the bathroom, remove my dress, and pick out each of these individually - there was at least a dozen, and I pulled a particularly large one out of my skin. Another left a tear in the lace on my dress. Upon my return, luckily, a busser had noticed and put a cushion there for me. I really believe he was the only hard working employee that night. I asked the server to let the manager know what happened and saw him tell him. Generally, at this point, I would expect an apology from the manager. Guess. Again. He did not once approach our table. I was very disappointed by this and was honestly fuming. The incident overshadowed the whole evening, and I regret ever stepping foot in this restaurant. The food was unmemorable and average at best, except the quail, which was exceptional. The skin was so crispy! Unfortunately, that was the single highlight of the evening but was not enough to balance out the misfortunes.	1star
If I could I give it a 1 star negative I would I work in the restaurant business for 8 years never been to a place this awful always been to Sammy  but wanted to switch it up location yes the server was no place to been seen we started with drink to him 20 minutes for drink we i gonna give you a example how long it took I went in at 6:45 then the drink we got then at 7:10 we place or food order they all come with salad I order 10 ounce NY Strip with lobster tail cook term medium well it was a while first 45 minutes salad came out but my did not I did not see the crappy server because he never came back to inform us the food was gonna take this long ok so I ask the busser he was sorry I am not the server it was 9 pm and we went to the front to get the manager I never saw the server the manager just was talking all kitchen is smash we got 500 ppl here ok his it my fault because you got 500 ppl for dining and I am waiting here more than 2 hours for food and my family and kids without eating the manager told us all we thrown some dessert I work in a spot myself and we fit 525 ppl and nobody waits more than 25minutes it unreal ok food finally come at 9:17 when it comes flavor is for a tourism spot no taste and I told the server when I see him what temperature I told.you he say medium well and I told him what this look like he say rare it what supper disappointing om.everything then he go.back and got me the food to.go and believe I feel sad who ever go there and waste they money buying bad food and service I always go to dine with the family top spot but this was 0-	1star
I stopped in for lunch on a Sunday afternoon, hoping to have a dining experience similar to those that I have had at the original 125th street location, but that was not to be. The service was lackluster (never checked in during the meal, never refilled my water, etc.) and the flavor of the egg and pork left a lot to be desired. The flavor of the broth definitely had a good spice level, but that was the only good thing about my Spicy Tonkotsu ramen. I have been to the 125th street location a handful of times but I will not be returning to this location.	1star
I'm always looking for places that do Xiao Long Bao (XLB) well, which brought me to Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao. I actually flew into La Guardia to check this spot out with my tight travel schedule. It was only a few miles from the airport and close to a train station to get to Manhattan. Perfect! Best XLB that I've tried so far. Yes, I've tried all the other well-known spots. Nothing on the west coast comes close to the XLB here. The meat to skin ratio is awesome; plenty of meat with a thin skin. This means that you have to be careful when handling these delectable pieces of heaven because if you're not, you'll be spilling some precious soup broth. 1 order comes with 6, so order accordingly. I had dinner plans, so I only ordered 1, which was a mistake. Next time I'm ordering 2-3 for myself. Service was fast and efficient, but don't expect friendly social service you might get at other NYC restaurants. CASH ONLY	5star
Mercato NY Manhattan Theater District/Port Authority 10:30pm Monday 30th November 2015  Three Stars The entrance is easily missable but this place should not be. The interior is cozy. The bar is fully stocked. They seemed genuinely friendly. It was a bit romantic so I decided to take my lasagne to go. (While I waited, I went next store to the wine store). The lasagne ($17) was a large portion. The meat sauce was divine. The tomatoes were fresh and bright. The veal was savory and with just right amount fattiness. The lasagne itself however wasn't very good. The six layers of pasta sheets were soggy. The cheese was overly melted. I want my lasagne to have a textural difference with fresh ricotta mixed with a heavy amount of herbs. It tasted like a veggie lasagne that they prepared a week and then simply heated it and top with fresh meat sauce.  I am sure I will go back but get something different.	3star
I've been reading lobster was cheap this summer due to warmer weather so lobster lover rejoice! Errh sort of... We tried the Brooklyn location. This lobster shack kind of hidden behind the sandwich shop but follow the buoys. It was a great day to have a picnic along the water and enjoy the view. We tried the Noah's ark to try all the sampling for two. That is two 'half' sandwiches of shrimp, crab and lobster with a choice of drinks and chips. All the toppings were held in a warm toasted bun that is slightly crispy on the outside. The lobster was brimming with claw meat. The crab equally so. The shrimp is the small variety type wasn't our favorite but pretty good.  When it comes to value let's say two halves don't make a whole unless it is a really small 'whole' sandwich.  As a treat along the water on a bright Sunday day during Dumbo Arts Festival  yes but it isn't economically viable all the time. I guess even with the gluttony of lobster there someone is still cracking all those claws for the meat without the mess we can all enjoy.  The price of convenience.	3star
This restaurant is very charming - a very inviting specious restaurant with a great bar. The waitstaff is very friendly and attentive as well. On a recent Visit we were very unhappy with our entrees. I had the rigatoni with eggplant which was very bland and barely had any flavor.  The pasta itself had no bite and just tasted off.  The waitress realized something was off as we barely ate any of our food and after speaking to someone in charge comped us a $10 appetizer. Thanks management	2star
Great people, jameson flowing, amazing mama's wings and laid back atmosphere.  Can't find a bar like this in the area.  Def a go to local spot!  I will be back.	5star
I always order sea urchin pasta and enjoy til the very last bite! I also liked Parmesan pasta, which comes in a huge Parmesan cheese bowl.(what a fabulous presentation!) Loved octopus appetizer, bolognese etc. The only thing about this amazing place is a bit cold service. Maybe they just don't want to bother you while you're having a great conversation with your friends but it's just that I didn't feel the  hospitality.	4star
Very dissapointing experience. Went for Lunch to celebrate a birthday...well, the least to be said Greek food is simply delicious..but Nerai managed to screw that completely.  Very plain, tastless, sad plates...The only thing that saved it was the waiting stuff, good survice. $300 later...a complete waste of money and time.	1star
"If you're looking for authentic Jamaican food...this place is not it! Omg it's so bad. Quoting another reviewer: ""an entire generation of Jamaican grandmothers rolled over in their graves"". I ordered the ox tails... Ox tails are not suppose to be so tough my goodness! Ox tails are supposed to be stewed for hours so that the meat is so tender it falls of the bone. And the flavors are all off. If you want to try some real Jamaican food and get an authentic experience head a couple avenues over to the islands. Real Jamaicans actually cook the food. Just saying..."	1star
We stopped in for a late lunch after a morning of sightseeing. Seriously, the best Italian food I have ever had. Amazing!  Try the gnocchi and Fumetto. Great service as well.	5star
Great food and ambience. However the quality doesn't match the prices. I was expecting more.	4star
I'm not sure what to say that's already been said multiple times. 1. Service-impeccable - we didn't have reservations at the restaurant portion, just the tavern-but asked if there was a cancellation to fit us in if possible---we got In!!  2. Service was beyond amazing and the staff was extremely knowledgeable. 3. We tried the tasting menu. Typically my group always adds salt or need hot sauce but we experienced the good without adding any ingredients which tells you the level of sophistication and each dish. Hands-down one of my favorite experiences in New York	5star
Disappointed. I've been looking forward to dining at Marea for a while but I left feeling underwhelmed. The dishes that we ordered were very good but not as good as I expected given all of the hype. The worst part however was the service. We dined at the bar and were practically ignored while witnessing some very rude behavior by the bar manager towards his employees. In addition, the couple next to us (who arrived 20 minutes after us) received and finished their dinner before ours was even brought out. We all ordered pasta so I'm not sure what happened there. Overall the experience left us feeling uncomfortable and unwelcome. For the price I didn't feel like it was worth it. I don't think we'll be coming back.	2star
I miss their French toast from time to time. Hope to be there immediately! That's how I feel about this place after just going once and having the French toast. And that French toast totally convinced me to make my second trip there.	5star
"Good Bowls, decent buns, nothing phenomenal. Pricing is far too high. $15 for a rice bowl with veggies and meat, 5$ per bun. Not THAT excited to have a new overpriced ""Asian Fusion"" restaurant in my hood. Like another reviewer said: ""The price is compatible with Chuko and Momofuku"" --except Bunsmith isn't nearly as tasty/well portioned? (**sorry!**) Service was decent."	3star
This place was EVERYTHING. Came here for a celebratory dinner and was lucky enough to score a table with no wait time. Being Korean, I admit I can get pretty critical of modern Korean restaurants being able to maintain traditional flavors. 1. Service - on point. Despite it being a full house, everyone was extremely attentive, friendly, and accommodating. As soon as we sat down, we were given a complimentary aloe soju shot. 2. Menu - I loved that the menu had pictures of each of the dishes. I will absolutely be bringing my non-Korean friends here. 3. Ambiance - trendy, lively, solid background music. 4. Last but not least the food was INCREDIBLE. The portions were perfect for a good sized taste of everything. Dishes that stood out were the fish buns, spicy wings, and sashimi salad.	5star
"Talde is the gastronomic brainchild of Top Chef Dale Talde and partners David Massoni and John Bush. The decor and location are wonderful, perfect for outdoor brunch or a fun date. The food is ""Asian American"" with Korean, Thai, Chinese, Filipino, and Japanese flavors melding with some American ingredients.  Perry and I showed up at 6:00 on a Sunday and put our names in for a 40 minute wait. We went for a walk to kill time. The bar is open and friendly and the hostess was on top of things, but there really isn't a place to stand and wait. You're going to be in the way, no matter what. True to her word, we were seated 40 minutes later.  The dining room is beautiful, with an impressive collection of Asian mahogany wood-carvings that was salvaged from an antiques warehouse. Juxtapose the dark wood with the gigantic picture windows that look out on 7th Ave and the place feels magical. There are less than 100 seats, so it can feel intimate at times. However, the acoustics are a bit loud. Perry and I ordered: Kung pao chicken wings Short rib kare kare Oyster and bacon pad thai Market veggie - brussel sprouts The kung pao chicken wings were a good starter, fried sweet and spicy sticky morsels. They come with a moistened napkins to clean up with, which is a great thought. The fried oysters and bacon pad thai is really really tasty. Most Americanized pad thai is overly sweet. The smoky bacon flavor actually enhances the sweet and savory components. The vinegar based hot sauce at the table also boosts the spicy content if you need it. The oysters, while tasty, were more a fun bonus to the dish than really complementing anything. After that, everything else we tried sucked. We didn't even want the leftovers. The short rib kare kare was very one note in flavor and in texture. The short ribs were tender and the noodles were prepared well. But it was completely forgettable and lacked depth. The brussel spouts were fried with a tart cream of some kind, with the consistency of mayo, but more sour. Maybe a herby yogurt? I really didn't like it. The brussel sprouts lacked the green sweet flavor of cabbage and just tasted bitter and sour.   I would come again for the pad thai and if there was no wait. But otherwise, the items we ordered just let us down."	2star
Three stars because of the welcoming atmosphere, people are nice, service is OK, good late hours, and food is consistent. Food however is not to my taste (one star). Some of the simpler dishes (noodles) are palatable, but many of the things remind me of the food you would get at a suburban strip mall. That might however be what you are looking for.	3star
When I say this has been the best pizza of my life, I mean it!  Located in Little Italy, this small place is serving up BIG flavor.  Be prepared to wait on average around 45 minutes for a table if you don't have reservations. Luckily, you can give them your cell number and they will text you when your table is close to being ready so you can head that way.  All the pizzas look  and smell amazing, but the classic is my favorite! If you want to half and half your pie, try Rubirosa Supreme - it's delicious if you like meat!	5star
- Very dark, too dark to read menu - Service was not great, servers were slow and never refilled my water - Food was ok, my pasta dish was extremely salty - I will not be going back :(	2star
This place was surprisingly good. I thought that the reviews were deceiving but that wasn't the case.  PROS -Great service, everyone is friendly. (I would walk to the restroom and people would help open the door or always ask if we need anything else).  -VERY patient -Very big place, can bring parties (BUT 20% gratuity for parties of 6 or more) -Great combination. At first I thought it was weird with burger and lobster but it tasted great together (the spotlight combo) Was really filling and the burger tasted one of a kind.  CONS -Might have trouble with parking or locating. It was like a hole in the wall compared to other places.  -$$ quite expensive BUT it is lobster. Every order comes with salad and fries.  I don't have many cons but I did rate it a 4 (wanted to put 4.5) for the price. Yes it was lobster and New York so I don't expect much but a buffet could easily been $20-25. Spotlight combo which includes a 6oz burger and 1lb of lobster with salad and fries was really filling so that's good.  OVERALL: 4.5; would recommend to friends.	4star
"Hot spot in Manhattan that I think you should definitely try once. Ambiance is great and its a really nice spot for a date or girl's night (imagine fire places in the winter!). Also, they can accommodate larger groups so that's a plus if you want to do a celebration of some sorts.  This is a tapas bar and their serving sizes are true to this. My table was a little shocked at just how LITTLE some of the dishes were (and the prices were near the 20's for these). I think each person needs to order 3-4 plates to get decently full here and even then, you can probably go eat something else afterwards. The things we did order were all pretty good though (nothing to rave about but I liked the fried goat cheese). They do have a few vegetarian options on their menu, which is nice. I think making the portion sizes just a tad bit larger (to try and meet the price tags) would still keep the ""tapas"" atmosphere but make the experience a lot more worthy.  Go here for a nice dinner (just bring your wallet full as they only take Amex or cash :)"	3star
Came here on a Saturday night with hopes of getting great food and maybe a drink or two. When walking in the bar is pretty busy but my bf& I are seated quick at a table . Ordered our food it took 30 minutes to come ... He ordered a cocktail , however there was maybe a drip of alcohol in it . Then our food came and the fries I had to send back. It tasted like they had been fried in old old oil and were soggy and cold which worried me because he wait was long enough for the food . The wings were mediocre , I would just never go here again. The foods cheap ! That's the only plus but you get what you pay for I guess	2star
I've never paid so much for so little ramen. Granted, it is incredibly good ramen -- strong broth, great noodles, unique add-ons -- but on even a weekday night (my friends and I went on a Monday!), expect a 40 minute wait for a party of five. Once seated, though, service is fast. We quite liked the selection of desserts and drinks available, so overall, we thought it was a great experience.	4star
Wanted veggies and Bi bim Bap save the day.  When I look around, it seems that their most popular thing was the dol pan kimchi bokum bap.	3star
Bad attitude. Bad hospitality.   Made us give up our seats even though we were already seated because the last member of our party was a few minutes late. Felt bad for our out-of-town guests who were looking forward to trying the place.  We decided to go to a nearby  restaurant that actually wanted our business.  I would NEVER come back.	1star
Been here two weeks ago with my husband and baby. I didn't like it one bit. It took so long to sit us down. After we ordered causa and ceviche and anticucho it took long time to get to the table and were not so good. Causa was ... Meh.. Had way better and ceviche was horrible. The worst I ever had and we eat ceviche on daily basis. After 45 min we requested a check and anticucho came after the check. And no one even bothered to apologize for that. Will tot come back	1star
I don't feel like I know enough about Japanese ramen or have tried this place enough to do their food critique justice. Highlights: - Absolutely friendly staff - Came in solo on a Friday at 1pm -- wait was 10 minutes tops - Vibe! No idea what they were all saying loudly in Japanese every time someone was going to be seated, but boy was I awake! No chance for a food coma until you step out those doors. - Their seasoned soft-boiled egg is sooo gooey (yolk) in a really good way & was VERY well-marinated! I'd come back just for that! ($2 tho) - Green tea crepe layered cake...thing. (The one with a gazillion layers!) SO GOOD. Their mousse or cream makes each bite all the more savorable. (Don't know my desserts & made up a new word...) If you have $11 to throw down for a slice, do it! I'm glad I didn't know of the price until AFTER the check arrived. Ignorance was truly bliss. Would I come back for the ramen? Well, I got the Akamaru Modern. Broth: 9/10, Pork: 3/10 (not flavorful, a bit thick, & a little tough), Noodles: 5/10 (too firm for me...would have liked it cooked a bit longer), Overall Dish: 7/10. But this isn't factoring into my rating because I don't know ramen enough to know what each kind is SUPPOSED to taste like. They could be doing this dish exactly how it should be for all I know. But YEAH, I will learn more & come back!	5star
The biscuits and sausage gravy with the side of fried chicken is solid.  They give you a huge portion and I left a lot on my plate behind because the gravy became too rich.  But other than that, I loooooved it. I liked that we got to sit outside for our brunch, because the inside seemed a bit cramped and too busy. It gets super packed during weekend brunch hours (not surprised) and they don't take reservations, so your best bet is to get here as soon as they open. We both agreed the girl busing our tables seemed to have a 'tude though, like she couldn't be bothered to do her job.  But all the other serving girls were friendly and helpful, so everything was okay in the end.	4star
Pros - the steamed lobster is very fresh  - inside of the restaurant is pretty spacious and the service is good - Lobster roll tastes buttery and amazing and I like how it is served with french fries and salad Cons - honestly, I cannot think of any particular cons for this place. If I crave for steamed lobster, this is definitely the place I should visit in the future.	4star
All I can say is DELICIOUS !!  Last time I came to Harlem for Apollo Show I went to Silvia's. Someone told me Amy Ruth is better and I agree. I ordered the honey dipped fried chicken with baked macaroni n cheese with collard greens. The meal came with warm corn bread w butter and I ordered a peach mimosa and banana pudding. The chicken was amazing, crispy skin on outside with tasty sauce but very tender juicy meat inside .  The Mac and cheese was very creamy the way I like and perfectly seasoned. I am most picky about Mac n cheese more than any other food. So for me to be impressed says a lot. I enjoyed the collard greens and you would too if you don't mind a little sugar in it. I didn't really care for the peach mimosa, it wasn't peachy enough n was too carbonated. Banana pudding is a soul food fav dessert of mine and I ordered to go.  I enjoyed the Hip hop music playing and classic photos on wall. It looks like a take out spot and there was a little confusion with take out line verse eating in. If you are eating in you can sit like restaurant and be served instead of ordering like McDonald's then sitting.  I really enjoyed my meal here and wish it was closer to home. This will definitely be my harlem go to spot and I would highly recommend if you enjoy soul food :-p #yelpislife	5star
The food and drinks were excellent but the service was awful. The waiter had a small section of the restaurant but I only saw him when he took my order. I had to find another server to track him down for my check.	3star
I would've loved you more if the ramen hadn't come out so lukewarm. I'm not asking you to warm my soul, but I was a bit shocked at how it wasn't even remotely hot enough to have the broth tickle my nose a little with a bit of steam. It's now hit dead winter, which means, warm broth is an absolute necessity in my NYC survival kit.  I'm giving it 3 stars in light of its potential and price. It's only $13 for the Kuu Chili, which was overall, quite decent, but doesn't measure up to the big name ramen spots littered all over the city. With the lack of ramen spots in FiDi, it's more than enough to be an option to consider when limited to the area.  I work in midtown where there's no shortage of competition amongst the heavy name ramen champions. So, with that said, I've been spoiled. I mean, even in NJ where I live, I'm a couple steps from Menya Sandaime and blocks from at least 3 awesome ramen spots. So, yes, I've  developed a very loving fuzzy relationship with ramen and this spot won't be making the cut just yet. The broth was forgivable, but it needs work.  It's also a hole in the wall, so please try not to come with a giant crowd of 10 and make a god damn scene. We sat next to 3 very obnoxious ladies yesterday - I don't think the sake helped, but I wouldn't make this a date night nor a group gathering spot. It's shoulder to shoulder over here, so please move with caution. I'd hate to waste a bowl of ramen AND your well-lined coat. Service was fine - the place is small enough to get noticed quick. Ramen came out quick as well. I'd love to try their rice bowls soon!	3star
First...the food was good.  Was it the best Italian...no!!! We went there for my mom's birthday and it just didn't feel special.  Slow service.  I walked out disappointed.  We normally go to Grotta, thought based on reviews we would try something new.  Had to pay $10 for a dry slice of cheesecake just to do a rush birthday celebration	3star
There is no combination quite like that of bar food and traditional Chinese cooking. Jeff the owner runs the show while his brother helps with the bar and their mom runs the kitchen. This is my version of Cheers for great laughs great food and fun atmosphere. A hole in the wall usually full of locals and regulars hidden behind all the fancy seaport spots this is a place you can just let your hair down. I hope you like Jameson because it flows pretty heavy!	5star
Five stars for food  Two stars for service  The worst thing you can do as a customer is bug a server to check the status of your food at peak hours.  The worst thing you can do as a server is to not touch your table even a SINGLE time after customers still haven't received their food after 50 minute.  I've been here numerous times before, and I was always surprised by how fast the food came out  and how attentive the servers were before. Today was a different story. 50 minutes in I realized the people at the bar and tables around me had already been turned over TWICE, and I still haven't received my food. That's when I decided to ask my server and though they were apologetic about the wait time, they had given me the excuse that the other diners had just received their appetizers. Its totally understandable that there's a long wait time on a weekend, and I understand that mistakes happen whether it be the with the server or the Kitchen, but to flat out lie to my face was just wrong. I won't stop coming here, I can't deny that the food is great,  But I hope the servers will be more attentive in the future.  Sometimes just telling the truth and admitting to a mistake makes the biggest difference with a diner.	4star
Very overrated. Food isn't bad but def not NY pizza. Very minimal sauce, cheese and bread aren't bad but I don't see how people put this as one of the best spots in NYC. Very small portions and not worth the price. Also got the olives as an appetizer which people raved about but in my opinion I didn't see what the big deal was. But they were busy so they are doing something right is maybe just not the spot for me.	3star
Great spot for hanging out, drinking, listening to music. They won't see me back there. To many amazing spots to go to. ;)  *KEEP IN MIND*... Highly recommended reservations (per the women who slide the card to my friend and looked at her in the eyes); nothing on yelp said that. No website to look that up.  HH is in the bar Only (NO one told us and we had three people we encountered with). Made us feeling a little weird getting out of the dining area and go to the bar BC we didn't know why we had a choice!  PROS... Its buy two get one, PER PERSON...(clarifying; It's TWO drinks and then ONE drink for free (per person)). That's a lot of drinks great deal, but not for us. Just keep that in mind.  The coconut mojito was tasty, the empanadas were great flavor. The plantains were delicious. Food was hot, but for 21 bucks for an app. and one drink; defiantly could go some place else for more food and better customer service. Great atmosphere and great times catching up with my friend!!! Rolling of the eyes from the bartender un expectable after we were nice and what not. We aren't in competent, we heard the lady, it's not that big of a deal, just make sure you say the full deal (PER PERSON). The hostess argued with us on the floor in front of the whole place (really classy). The manager of the floor, took 15 mins to talk to the GM about clarifying the deal and overriding the free drink, but we didn't want a drink. We wanted the deal they told us. :/ (this place isn't this big). It wouldn't take this long in any other restaurant. Made me realize why I don't like trying new spots! (We KNOWW that's not true).  Where are the signs about the HH in the place? Where is the website for me to look at? I wasn't a happy person. 3.5 went to a 2 for me. Live music (Thursday) and the tasty drink made the 2 star happen. I hate writing reviews like this, but at the same time. Customer service wasn't there the only professional person was the manager, Grace. Thanks	2star
The food is good but not great, especially at these price points. The atmosphere is weird and hard to feel comfortable. Waiters unhelpful. Try Yopparai in LES for an amazing izakaya.	3star
This one is a good restaurant that offers good food, good service and a pleasant dining experience. Alfresco dining is preferred because it is located along King St, in Old Virginia.	4star
Really great experience. The food was great, the milkshake was delicious and it has a really nice atmosphere. Our waiter, Chandler, was so cool and an absolute gem! Will be visiting again soon!!	5star
We came here on a Friday night and managed to beat the dinner crowd and got immediately seated. We decided to share the Gnocchi, kimchi paella, Tuna tataki and seafood pancake. While they were all good, I felt that the portions were real small. Daughter also ordered the Fresh Lemonade drink and loved it. Service was friendly.	3star
After reading some reviews and browsing the menu I thought it would be a good option. However, I was super disappointed and underwhelmed with the overall experience. The eggnog waffle tasted like and eggos waffle and lacked any flavor resembling eggnog. The rest of the food: salmon, chicken, and spinach was just okay. The Mac and cheese was good!  Wouldn't come back again.	3star
Mekelburg's seems like a decent place, but when I went there last night to buy a snack, I was watched by the cashier to see if I was stealing. It was very disheartening, especially because I was wearing pajamas and carrying a coin purse. If I was going to steal something, it would have been noticeable. As I was contemplating buying cashews, the cashier pretended to be fixing up the area next to me. Sadly, I could see her just picking items up and then setting them back down. When I decided on pizza and went up to the register, the cashier looked me up and down, as if to see if I had hide something in my pajama shorts. As a woman of color, the last thing I want when I'm going grocery shopping is to be discriminated against. I really hope the cashier doesn't reflect the morals of Mekelburg's.	1star
I've been on a BBQ binge lately and this place is easily one of the best BBQ places in NY. The shredded pork is tender, and the andouille sausage is perfectly spiced. The side dishes are also quite strong, which I appreciate for a BBQ place. I loooved the baked beans - they were hearty and sweet and tender. Can't wait to go back!	4star
Extremely busy here! If you're in a group of 3 and less you are most likely going to be sat at a big table with random strangers. You do get your own pot of tea so you won't be needing to reach over for someone else's pot.  Anyways, everyone usually minds their own business so that's a plus. I never pick a favorite place for soup dumplings. Honestly, they all taste delicious to me lol.  I got the scallion pancakes here (I don't recommend it's very oily and thick!) I like my scallion pancakes flatter and crisp.  We also got crabmeat and pork soup dumplings.  I didn't like that crabmeat much, but the pork dumplings are always my go-to!  Tip on how to eat your dumpling.  1. Grab dumpling with metal clasp and put on top spoon making sure you don't pop the dumpling so that the soup doesn't spill everywhere.  2. Bite open the top  3. Pour in red vinegar sauce  4. Slurp the soup (but not all of it!)  5. And put whole dumpling in mouth or bite it little by little.  That's my way of doing it, but you can figure out what works best for you!	4star
Great food, great service. The prices were very reasonable. It's a very classic kind if NYC dining experience, not fancy, but tasty and great. The servers were very polite and attentive. I will come back for the open turkey sandwich, which was so tasty and moist with wonderful gravy.	5star
"Decided to check out this location based on yelp stars for some dinner after work, and I guess I wasn't the only one that needed a glass of wine after work on a Tuesday because the placed was packed with people in ""business attire"" lol. We got a seat right away, and the waitresses were on top of us asking if we were ok, needed a refill and if we were done. Overall it was a Ok place, the food was alright and the vibe was just enough to say I got some food and wine after work, nothing fun or amazing lol."	3star
This place had the audacity to serve me spoiled meat and then claim that it was fresh and came in that day.  I asked the chef to taste it himself... of course not. He should be ashamed of himself.	1star
Wow so beyond disappointed in this place. I haven't been here in let's say a good year. For starters the service was terrible. Very slow and inattentive. I started with a tuna tar tar which the one I had when I first started coming here was phenomenal, the one they have now on the menu is disgusting. I don't know why they would switch it and make little piles of tuna and salmon? To scoop up with these 4 greasy chip. Just horrible. My friend said the gatsbys salad was good but how bad can u mess up a simple salad? My one friend got the seafood pasta. For what they charge u get like 3 sandy clams, a half a lobster tail, and 3 shrimp and box of pasta. At least the pasta was cooked al dente that much I can give them. My other friend ordered the short ribs. The mashed potatoes it came with tasted like box mashed potatoes so gritty and just flavorless. The short ribs themselves were rubbery and did not fall of the bone like perfectly cooked short ribs. It legitimately jiggled when I touched it.  The sauce on it was so salty. She obviously sent it back (No manager came over to apologize for their short comings either) My other friend who is a vegetarian got the vegetable tart for $20. It was thin phyllo dough and some sour smelling cheese, and 3 frozen looking string beans on top with some other frozen looking veggies on it. The drinks were good that's all I can say about this last and final experience I will ever have here. This WAS my favorite place for a long time. I looked like an idiot because I hyped this place up like it was the best thing next to slice bread and my girlfriends told I'm never allowed to pick a restaurant again. My guess here would be they switched chefs, managers and maybe even owners.	1star
"Tommy T. Thank you for your prompt reply.  I must have hit a soft spot by damaging your illustrious star rating. Rather than replying to a customer with your obnoxious and childish manner, perhaps you should take a step back and think ""hmm, my customer last night had a bad experience, maybe I should look into this and talk with my staff"".  There are so many ways you could have handled it but you chose to do it in true kindergarten fashion.  Let me take a moment to go over some of the comments you made.  Your pours.  I am not telling your establishment to give a half glass of whiskey.  I understand that over pouring will hurt your margins but honestly, you need to go to other bars and see that your pours are below standard.  If the drinks are finished after 2 sips, then there is no incentive to stay and continue to waste our money.  I paid CASH all night.  You remember cash, its green and rectangular and there's no fees associated with it.  Well I used cash all night and after awhile you would think your bartenders would give another drop or two, but I guess you've trained your staff, for countless hours, to make pours to be always and precisely Cheap.  You do not allow yourself to get crowded.  I get it, you're looking to give your patrons a certain ambience that is not interrupted by crowds; that's an acceptable answer, however I do see one flaw in your argument, NO DOORMAN OR BOUNCER.  Anybody can just walk in whether they had a reservation or not and stand at the bar.  In order to comply with your argument you need someone at the door to limit the number of customers from walking in and the coat check girl does not count.  Please refrain from using that as an excuse as to why your bar is half full on a weekend.  Let's be honest with ourselves okay, a place like yours in your location should definitely be more crowded than it was that night.  Don't be discouraged, perhaps the problem is that you like to belittle and berate the few customers that you have.    Now maybe the word ""suck"" referring to your mic and speakers was a misjudgment on my part, I apologize, after all, the only ear I have for music quality comes from High School Band-- French horn go figure.  I had no idea there was an ""Award Winning Sound and Design Team"" behind it!  I must have been mistaken, because I couldn't hear the vocals all the way from the front of the bar in the perfectly curated crowd of people that wasn't there.  Perhaps you overpaid for that installation or maybe the volume wasn't high enough to maximize the true value of your Award Winning Sound and Design. Alas, your final insult, ""We never set out to please everyone (just those classy enough to appreciate us).""  Wow, as a business owner you SHOULD do your best to please everyone.  You are in the Food and Drink Business, that should be your top priority.  I am not saying its possible to please everyone but to actively say you're not set out to please everyone is absolutely indicative of an owner who is acting like a petulant child who can't take constructive criticism.  I've never met a business owner so averse to improving and potentially profiting their business, but I guess there's a first for everything. Listen Tommy T, can I call you Tommy.. I don't claim to be one of these YELP Elitist who can make or break a business, I am just an average NYer (born and bred) who came into your bar to meet some friends to have a drink and my not-so-pleasant experience turned into a worse experience,  because of how poorly you handled this situation.  In the future, I would suggest (though you don't take suggestions well it seems) before you personally reply to a customer's review with your passive aggressive remarks, you should stop and consider the much needed improvements, you know, instead of antagonizing them.  You have a really good bar but if you're not willing to listen to the people who patronize your business then I guess I'll be seeing you on the next episode of Bar Rescue soon. Sincerely, Spencer Mustache"	1star
This is one gastropub that won't disappoint!  We dropped in after visiting the 9/11 Memorial.  I can't remember what it was called, but we started with some sort of tri that had tzatziki, hummus & babaganoush with warm pita bread.  All 3 dips were amazing, I wanted to like the bowl of the tzatziki, and I'm sure the pita bread had just been made.  My husband had a Philly with onion rings.  I know, a Mediterranean restaurant, and he had a philly.  Doesn't matter, it was so good, and did you know that tzatziki is good on onion rings too?  I had chicken souvlaki - the small plate.  It seemed plenty big to me.  The chicken was so moist and the flavor was perfect.  And, I got my tzatziki and pita bread.  I would totally have that again.  I highly recommend giving this place a try.  You won't be disappointed!	5star
Nothing beats a cup of hot chocolate while roaming Liberty Island. We stopped here for some hot chocolates since we were all cold and sleepy. This is a cute little cafe that sells foods from salads to burgers to sushi. Kind of random but something for everyone. There is also a bookstore connected to this where you can buy souvenirs. The workers here were welcoming and loved that we were from Los Angeles.	3star
My wife and I had the opportunity to have dinner at Calle Ocho in the Upper West Side during our visit to NYC. We love food and part of our trip was dedicated to trying as many of the best restaurants in NYC as we could have time to visit. Needless to say, we ate a lot during our trip, but none of the dining experiences were better than our dinner at Calle Ocho. The food was superb, with great flavors and perfect presentation, definitely the type of dishes worthy of showing off to your facebook friends. We had the Gallitos which consisted of 3 different meats, all delicious. My wife had the Paella, seafood rice, and the seafood was perfect. We also love drinks and Calle Ocho didn't lack in their drink options. I was able to enjoy an amazing Costa Rican beer called Imperial which is rare to find in restaurants in the US and we also enjoyed many complimentary sangrias, tropical being my favorite and coconut being my wife's favorite. It was all topped off with excellent customer service, I never lacked a drink and my food was timely. It was the best dinner we had in NYC, exceeded all of our expectations and we highly recommend it to anyone visiting or living in NY. This will be the first restaurant we go to when we make it back.	5star
Some of my friends introduced this place to me. It was a bit longer since I got the opportunity to visit this place. One of my friends said that, I should try first the ribs and the decision was perfect. That was more than my expectation. Probably, coming back by next week, to see what they can do more.	4star
Small place with seating for maybe 30 with delicious ramen. Service was fast and efficient and even though we were sitting on somewhat uncomfortable bar stools we enjoyed ourselves and had a good meal! Ramen was all my wife and I had when we came here. I had the Tonkotsu Pork Ramen, while she the chicken broth style ramen with corn, noodles, egg and pork and arugula. The Tonkotsu pork was delicious, hearty and savory broth. Unfortunately the egg was slightly overcooked, but the noodles were incredible. The pork was delicious, but only a few pieces of fatty pork were in my ramen which was a bit disappointing. Despite the imperfections (egg not cooked 100%, low pork content), service was fine and the hearty broth made up for it. The prices are fair for being in the financial district of Manhattan. Our meal for two was about $32 including tax and tip. We didn't order drinks or apps though.	4star
I've been searching for a place like this for a long time, and I finally found it. This place looks and feels like a standard midtown / UES wine bar, however it also serves spectacular food.  The restaurant is basically three components, outside seating in front, bar / indoor seating then a garden in the back. When we went it was scorching hot, event in the early evening, so the air conditioned garden was perfect. It was a sunday night and we had a reservation - seemed pretty crowded so if we didn't I'd imagine we'd have to wait. To start we split the veal meatballs and the prosciutto with bufala mozzarella.The meatballs were very good - put the meatball shop down the street to shame. The sauce they were in was a tad underwhelming, however the meatballs themselves were melt in your mouth good and full of flavor. The prosciutto / mozz was up there with the best I've had. Extremely generous portion of both cheese and meat. The mozz was perfect both in taste and texture. Normally I'd douse a dish like that in balsamic vinegar, but it was so good none was needed.  For the main course we had the Mezzellune alla Boscaiola (ravioli) and Pappardelle Al Ragu Di Vitello. Both were absolutely top notch. Pasta cooked perfectly al dente, and each dish was  phenomenal in its own way. I think I liked the pappardelle the best. The sauce contained a healthy portion of veal and montasio cheese. The veal itself was very flavorful, which you don't always see in a sauce - overall very good. The ravioli was great as well - I found the sauce to be a little bit heavy for my taste, however it seemed to work with the pasta. The pasta is stuffed with mozz and prosciutto - however it has more of a solid texture than I expected. Still very, very good and the creamy mushroom sauce really rounds it out.  Not a big wine drinker, but the selection seemed extensive. Had a lot of wines by the glass which is much appreciated by me. Prices overall were fair - food came to about $35/person + wine. Not sure about the $$ on Yelp - seems a little more like a $$$ place, but maybe I just eat a lot.  All in all - can't wait to come back.	5star
One of two brunch places that have been on my Queens/Astoria bucketlist for months. Sugar Freak on a bustling 30th Ave Sunday morning definitely didn't disappoint! We walked in on that morning at around 10:30 am - prime brunch time. However, the wait for a group of 2 wasn't horrible (40 minutes), but it was especially sweet because we were seated in 20 minutes! Service was fine, we were well taken care of by a smiley and sweet waitress. We got the oysters Rockefeller (good, nothing to write home about), the jambalaya (now that is something to write home about! A little dry, but nevertheless flavorful with well rounded flavors. The poached eggs helped with the drier rice of the jambalaya), and two bottomless brunch drink deals. It was $15 each for all-you-can-drink blood mary's, mimosas and beer and we definitely capitalized on that. The restaurant is so cutely decorated, the people were nice, the people dining in also in good spirits - how can you not be with alcohol presented to you when your cup's almost empty?!  On another note, the bathroom was so cute and had its own little radio playing country songs! I would go back just to admire the bathroom again. And get the jambalaya because it was just that good. Will definitely be back again!	4star
My chicken was delicious, juicy and tasty. Food came out quickly and the place is beautiful. The reason I only gave 3 stars is that I asked for more bread and the waiter never brought it.	3star
I had the steam lobster with fries and lemon garlic butter. It was really good. This place is great for getting a lobster at such a cheap price. My meal priced out to $30. It was good size portion. I didn't need anything more or less.  I came here with my sister and cousins as a party of 5 at 10pm on a Sunday night and was seated immediately. The server was polite and was attentive to the table the whole time.  I had the drink called 'The Fling' which was good nothing too crazy. But a nice cocktail to have with dinner.  I'd come back I guess if I'm in the mood for lobster. There's legit only two things on the menu. The lobster or burger or both.	5star
Came here with my boyfriend because we were curious about what the hype was about considering we would always see a long line for this place. I ordered the chicken and waffles honestly the chicken tasted horrible and it did taste like an easy to cook chicken patty that I can buy from the supermarket so nothing special. The waffles on the other hand were okay.  I also tried their tater tats in which also taste like some frozen food u can buy at the supermarket and do yourself so again nothing special. This place is overrated the food is so basic it's not worth your money if you're looking for a nice brunch place than go somewhere else. But if you like loud and noisy this might be the place for you. I couldn't even hear my boyfriend speak the music was so loud.	2star
Great location with lots of space to improve their food. I had the salmon. The skin reminded more of charcoal, medium rare was well done, and there was absolutely use of spices at all. Very plain. It was actually very hard to identify the food due to the lighting situation. Our neighbors returned there food two. A simple pasta dish. After taking a look at our other neighbors boring dessert  we just had a espresso macchiato. That one was quite good.	2star
"""This is soooooooo gooood"" is what I kept saying on repeat while as I was eating.  After waiting 20minutes for a table for 2, we decided on the following: -Pork Soup Dumplings (6 for $5.25), the broth was a little thin, less rich and fatty which I tend to favor   -Shanghai Lo Mein ($8.75) outstanding, thick noodles and delicious -Beef & Broccoli ($15.20) shockingly the best thing we tried These 3 dishes were the perfect amount for 2, it came out to about $39 with tip. The only reason this gets 4 and not 5 stars was because I wasn't blown away as expected by the soup dumplings. The over 900 reviews with a strong 4 stars makes perfect sense."	4star
Excellent food and exquisite service. I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone who's in the area. It's clearly popular as people were queueing to get in the night I visited - and it's easy to see why when the experience of dining here is so brilliant.	5star
I had high hope. Flavor was good. But a bit stingy on the meats. I went there two days in a row for lunch since I was nearby and it was the only thing I liked around there but a bit disappointed both times. 90% noodles and 10% meat. Meh...	3star
"SriPraPhai is an old Thai restaurant establishment going back in the 80s. Not sure how old this place really is, but my parents always came here back in the day. If you're in the Woodside area, it surely is a must!  Although this place is no longer the ""hidden gem"" of Woodside, Queens, the food and ambience is still good. Prices are decent but not entirely cheap. They have an extensive menu beyond Pad Thai and Thai iced tea so make sure to explore as much while you're here. My favorite noodle dish here is the Gai Kua, a flat noodle dish with peanuts, chicken, squid, and cilantro. The apps are a great addition as the entree may not entirely be filling if you haven't eaten much. Try their curry puff and spring rolls. If you aren't full, dessert is a must! Sticky rice, sweet soup, and ice cream dishes can be ordered here. There's also a sweets section to-go at the cash register.  In warm days, they have outdoor seating which may get a little itchy if mosquitos are out. It does feel very homey outside as it's a backyard setting.  Service is fast and friendly. Cash only!"	4star
This is a fun outdoor spot to sit outside and drink with friends.  You can chill and people watch to your hearts content. Also great for groups.  However, I have to say I feel like this place is coasting on its past glory, if it was ever considered glorious, when it comes to the actual food and drink.  Guacamole - meh Margarita - meh (especially for what tastes like a Walmart frozen mix) Tacos - meh to decent, depending on what you order. I'm partial to the shrimp tacos.  Corn - don't bother I usually come here because someone else has invited me to a group outing - like a birthday. It's festive and cool for that.	3star
Southern deliciousness. Definitely nab reservations during prime brunch hours because this place is a neighborhood favorite.  Their fried chicken is definitely what drives this place. So good!! We started off with the angel biscuits which were nice simple biscuits that was accompanied by honey roasted chicken jus. It had big chunks of sea salt which was the perfect complement. Overall it was very good, easy to share between 2-3 people.  We also shared their side of mac and cheese. Super cheesy with al dente cooked mac. Amazing! It had everything that I look for in a mac and cheese.  As for the main entrée, I got the fried chicken and waffle sandwich. Had two nice pieces of fried chicken, each on top of a soft waffle. The portions were big and I was full by the end of everything. Great fat brunch for sure!	4star
"The server was rude!!! Keep interrupting  the ordering while choosing the mixing, topping or whatever. Very rushing and even rudely told me how I should do $@""@&@. I think this restaurant should train her to shut her mouth first and learn to listen!  Later, quickly going thru the rush order, she checked out without wrapping my order and just left it on the desk because she was using her cell phone. After a few seconds it doesn't seem like she would do it. So I got the paper bag myself and put the bowl in. That's all fine with me, but then she suddenly said: yeah help yourself. What does it mean? Are you mocking at customer?  Wtf is wrong with this place? The whole experience is very insulting. You better train your employee for better manner and service. You don't deserve any tips. If I can give you zero star i definitely will!"	1star
3.5 stars. The food was spectacular and the cocktails were delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed my hot chicken and my boyfriend loved his cat fish. One of my two issues was there was constantly a fruit fly(maybe more than one?) buzzing around when I went. Nothing more agitating than pretending to be a cat swatting at air. The other, lack of service... After finishing our drinks we wanted to order more but as time passed our food was gone and still couldn't get anyone's attention. But overall food was worth it even if the service was lacking.	4star
Hole in the wall, up the stairs, through the next hole in the wall. They totally crushed it. They brought out a 1/2 lb burger, adorned in a delicious house made BBQ sauce, onions, grilled mushrooms avocado and some sides of fries, onion rings, and spinach to pull everything together. The burger was hefty but we left no survivors, it tasted to good to listen to the pleas of our stomachs to stop. Spinach was beautifully done, fantastic strong garlic taste. To top off everything we ordered a Shepard's pie which is composed of ground lamb and beef topped with perfectly done mashed potatoes, felt like home in my tummy yummmm.  Altogether a super tight spot to grab a nice dinner if you're walking around Manhattan and in the mood for some good old fashioned grubbing	5star
Nice addition to the neighborhood only thing missing is Queens lager from the tap list. On the food front the fried sausage things are your best bet.	4star
Decent ramen.  Not the traditional ramen with fatty broth on top and super thick tonkotsu broth. For 1 person, I had to wait about 25 mins on a Wednesday night. I ordered the Akumaru modern with extra pulled pork and bambo shoot. I was expecting to try the fatty broth on top that ramen bowls usually come with. To my surprise, ramen here doesn't seem to have fatty broth. The broth was on the light side too, even though the flavor was well balanced. The toppings such as chasu, menma, hot sauce paste, were nothing special. The pulled pork was too sweet. The noodles weren't the wavy noodles that I like. Not chewy enough for me. I usually ordered a sodo to break down the fatty taste of ramen, but the ramen here wasn't fatty at all so I felt like the soda that I ordered was not needed. Very expensive too. One bowl of ramen with extra pull pork and soda set me back $28. They did accept credit cards though. It was still good, but not WOW, so I will still give it 4 stars. Personally I still prefer Totto Ramen or Minca over Ippudo.	4star
3 1/2 stars. This place can serve pretty authentic Thai food but you really have to know what to order. Not everything is a win in this place. I came with Marco and we ordered the raw shrimp, the roasted duck on rice, the crispy ground catfish and the thai sausage. The raw shrimp hands down was the best thing. Amazing. I'd go back to this place just to order this. It's really outstanding. The roasted duck isn't bad but not great. The ground catfish is a waste. I've never had ground catfish so wasn't sure what to expect. It's like a hard powder that really has no taste. The sausage was solid though, would order this again. Next to the raw shrimp was a small order of mango salad which was really good also.  So overall, I'd come back to try other things but I really think you have to order the right things off the menu.	4star
Solid Malaysian place. Nice ambience especially for an Asian place and fast service.  I ordered the casserole mutton which kept hot in the casserole. Tender and flavorful meat. Comfort food. Super nutritious.  I also got the Chinese herb pork soup to start. The soup was amazingly flavorful but the pork had quite a bit of skin / fat on them - difficult to digest as the only solid- form ingredient in the soup.	4star
"Halal Guys is still a crave-worthy, delicious, fast and cheap meal, but I can't say I have that pure unfiltered love for it anymore, hence the subdued three stars (lol)...although it doesn't mean I won't still order a platter. As another reviewer mentioned, there have been changes over the years. There's now no longer lamb over rice (it's beef) and instead of the bottles of sauce drizzled on top, you get packets. The obvious change is that there are now many brick and mortar shops popping up both in NYC and the rest of the country. I noticed those changes when I visited the shop in SF. In other words, they've ""gone corporate"" which is what I was wary of when I lived in NY because with that, often comes frills and changes.  The last time I visited was on a rainy (but not pouring) day, and I could not for the life of me find a Halal Guys cart that people were actually lined up for. Where were the people?? It was so bizarre to me because there were wayyy more stands than when I last went a few years ago, and they were obviously new with bright, clean umbrellas. It just felt so off, and in the end I thought to myself, you know, these exist everywhere now, and this doesn't even feel like the OG anymore so why bother? Regardless, if you're visiting NY, you gotta get some grub from a halal cart (whether or not it's the Halal Guys.) It's such a NYC thing to do, part of daily life."	3star
I got an order of the famous pork belly buns to go.  I was really disappointed.  I've had much better for cheaper... and they were tiny.  The pork belly wasn't all that tender and I was hoping for a little crispiness on the outside.  The flavors weren't even that good, and it really needed something light/fresh to lift it a bit and something crispy to give it a little bit of texture.	2star
HOLY COW!!!!!! No pun intended... went here last Saturday with my brother and Steven (we biked there from Brooklyn Heights) and waited in line for over an hour, but it was SO worth it. They got brisket and baby back ribs, and I got turkey. We got mac and cheese, corn bread, collared greends, and cole slaw. The mac was amazing, the corn bread was legitimately life changing, and the other sides were delicious... The boys said their meat was insane and were only speaking out of stuffed mouths; and I had never had such moist and divine turkey.... we must go back!!!!!	5star
The atmosphere is very nice and the food is good but the quantity is a little too small.... or their plates are too big! That was so weird to see so much space on the plates!	2star
Oh yeah. Finally a 5 star.   Took me my lifetime to make it here and it sure didn't disappoint.  Our lunches were delicious and so was the bread.  Even got a nice little coconut cake dessert from the manager for some strange reason-- maybe because I was a big 9 1/2 months prego- but wow did we appreciate it.   The service from the waiters and host was all class.  Not like so many other uppity restaurants in town.  The service was not only friendly and respectful but very efficient.  The decor with the sunflowers everywhere - gorgeous. It is not only the food but the excellent service that makes me want to go back.	5star
I haven't been here in a couple of years - but still very packed from when I last remembered it and a lot brighter lighting. However, our party of 3 didn't have to wait long for seats. As long as the entire party is there, they'll try to seat you. If not, they ask you to wait. The food is still delicious as I remembered. I had the hainanese Chinese chicken and love it. I also got the Roti pancakes, another favorite of mine - especially for sharing. We tried the vegetable curry - which was really good. It was a good vegetable dish to add to the mix and it was curry too! Great place for family style meals aka sharing. The staff are a little hard to get ahold of, assuming because it's really busy. Not a lot of them speak english either. But still a great place for lunch and dinner nonetheless - it's cheap too (for the portions you get)!	4star
There is good reason why there's always a wait in front of Jacks wife Frieda. I LOVE this place. Honestly one of my favorite brunch spots in the city!  Though the space is tight in both locations (Carmine location seems slightly bigger), it is still fairly comfortable with great lightning, ambiance and outdoor seating. The menu is right on the table so ordering is quick and for all you germaphobic people, you don't have to touch anything! ::Insert Thumbs up emoji::  Service is quick too. In and out! I've been here quite a few times. This last visit, We ordered the Mediterranean breakfast and the breakfast bowl. I thoroughly enjoyed both of them as they were fresh, healthy and tasty. The Mediterranean breakfast included scrambled eggs, labne, avocado, a salad that was very delicious, and pita. My friend ate everything off her plate!  I had the breakfast bowl which has a choice of scrambled or poached eggs, spaghetti squash, red onions, kale and quinoa. I felt so good afterwards because I wasn't crazy full and I knew it was healthy for me!  My friend also got the cantaloupe juice. Not too sweet and very refreshing. I'll be back agaib and again!	5star
Everything we had was incredible, plus we showed up on the early side (5ish) one chilly Saturday in November and got sat right away by the window. The wine menu is great and the food was delicious. I wouldn't waste your time on salad, get the good stuff! Also, the tiramisu was great. I will definitely be back here again!!! Worth the trip to the Bronx :)	5star
I've eaten at this restaurant before, but at another location here in Brooklyn. At that time I ordered their fried rice,  which is usually great. But this time,  things were different. The wait was long, which is expected since it was a Saturday night- no problem. After being seated, my friend and I ordered.  Food and drinks came promptly,  but lacked any flavor in both meals. He ordered Chicken stir fry and I had the Fried Red Snapper in curry sauce with rice.  The rice was extremely gummy, and my fish had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. It tasted like a fried oily mess. I tried to eat as much as I could, seeing that red snapper is a very meaty fish,  but they fried it so much it started crumbling. The only thing good about this meal were the tons of vegetables they topped my oily fish with, their appetizers and wine.  Smh..I will not be coming back here at all. Especially after the young lady (who wasn't even our hostess) showed our receipt to the woman who actually took our orders to show her that no tip was being left. ..and then came over and asked if we were leaving a cash tip!!.. How about no!! A waste of $62..(seriously??-the Person who took our orders and brought the food to us never came back to check and see if we needed anything, like most normal establishments)..this is so unacceptable..horrible..never again. .	2star
I was looking for a seafood dinner, specifically oysters, in the seaport area and found Fishmarket on Yelp. The dishes looked unique and delicious and the page has excellent reviews. I read the menu before going with a friend last week and noticed that many of the menu items had an Asian twist. Based off all of the excellent reviews and various items to choose from on the menu, we decided to go.  When we arrived at Fishmarket it kind of looked closed/dingy on the outside. We walked in and it was a fun/happening environment. The bartender looked at us and knew it was our first time. We walked through a crowded bar area with pretty loud music and groups of people drinking towards a table in the back of the restaurant. The restaurant is definitely on the divey side, but could immediately tell this was a hidden gem.   The bartender/waiter came over to us and was super friendly. Right after we placed our drink and food orders, the bartender walked over to every table in the restaurant and gave each person a shot of Jameson to take together. My friend & I had no clue what was going on, but went with it.  We ended up ordering a dozen oysters, steamed pork dumplings, and fried rice with sausage. All of the food was excellent! I specifically loved the rice. It was so delicious and unlike any other fried rice I've had.  After my experience at Fishmarket, I can tell this place is special and caters to all types of people. There was a family there appreciating the eclectic asian dishes, younger people drinking for happy hour, and a bunch of groups enjoying dinner. Highly recommend trying out Fishmarket if you're in the seaport area. Looking forward to going back again soon!	5star
"Love the ambiance of this place. It's so cute! Bang Bang sauce has some serious heat. If they bottled the stuff and sold it, I'd be first in line to buy. Crunchy coconut rice is as tasty as everyone else says; it might not sound like much (I didn't get much coconut flavor out of it) but it's definitely worth trying! One of the small plate specials of the night was a ""Brussels sprouts leaves"" with bacon type of thing. The ingredients were kind of unrecognizably browned/fried. Bf liked it but I found it too oily. Banana wrapped red snapper was a very tasty piece of fish. Menu says it comes with ""Bang Bang"" but it did not appear present in the dish, which was just the fish and a pile of yummy greens on the side.  Chili prawns were just okay; I expected the dish to have more of a kick but I didn't get much chili flavor. It was just kind of salty. The thick toast was wonderful for mopping up the juices. The weirdest thing to me was the way the drinking water worked...we were asked when we sat down whether we'd like bottled or tap water, and we ordered a bottle of still water. What we got was a big glass bottle that's just like something you'd see in any other restaurant, which they fill with tap water and leave on your table for self-serve. Our bottle said ""Khe-Yo"" on it.  After we drained our first bottle, a server asked if we wanted another one, and we said sure. The group next to us also had a bottle of water on their table; nobody else in the restaurant did. At the end of our meal we were charged $8 for two bottles of ""LRG Khe-Yo Still"" water. I didn't ask (though I wanted to), but unless Khe-Yo is branding and manufacturing its own spring water back there, were we paying for the privilege of pouring ourselves tap water? Or were they filling the glass bottles with gallons of Poland Spring or something? I'm not upset, just confused. That aside, I liked Khe-Yo but probably wouldn't come back. The food had lovely presentation, and I loved the bang bang sauce and crunchy coconut rice, but the other dishes were merely good and not spectacular."	3star
I wasn't impressed!   It was super hard to locate!!!This restaurant is sandwiched between 2 popular Korean restaurants.  There is hardly any signage to speak about.  I walked past it several times and took me at least 15 minutes, trying to walk into hotels etc to locate this hidden restaurant.  Thankfully there was no wait. I arrived a little after 2pm so the lunch crowd might have slowed down.  It was a super loud place like a disco bar.   You couldn't even hear your own voice.  Super Disliked! The sushi was on the petite side. I ordered grilled mackerel with rice and 2 small sides which I didn't enjoy (macaroni).    With a proliferation of authentic Japanese restaurants in Manhattan, I think this place was more pricey! The server was also not attentive, having to remind 2 times before green tea was served.	3star
I came here with my girlfriend. I ordered the steak medium rare and she ordered the salmon. The starter was a free salad we got from checking in on yelp. That was pretty good, flavorful with mangos and avocados added. Next thing that came out was a cute little steamed egg in what looked like a teacup. That was very yummy. The entrees came with rice, miso soup, and kimchi. I didn't love the place but it wasn't horrible. The steak wasn't special but my girlfriend did say that the salmon was really good. I wish they really had more side dishes to add to the experience. The best part of this meal was definitely the service because they were always on top of the water and napkins. Seating was quick too. Maybe because the place was slow but still have to give them credit	3star
Superb service, an especially nice atmosphere, and good food make Casa Enrique a solid 4 stars. The staff are very knowledgeable and accommodating, and our server was great with making recommendations.  The space is chic and whether you're on a first date trying to impress in your Sunday best, or on your 1,000th date in sweats with no cares to give, celebrating a birthday, you'll somehow fit right in at Casa Enrique. The guacamole is a conventional, but good way to start, the meatballs are excellent (smoky and full of flavor), an order of tacos is worth splitting, and the entrees are enormous. The menu prices are reasonable considering the setting. I ordered the lamb shank and absolutely loved it. The fish is also well presented and perfectly prepared. I want to make my way through the entree list and will return for sure!	4star
"It's too bad Zero Stars is not an option, coz that what this restaurant deserves!!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$ here, there are much better dining options in NYC!  Food is meh, not real Laotian.  The service was TERRIBLE!!! The server took our drink / food order and then he never returned. He never came back for the rest of our meal - to ask if we wanted to order more food, dessert or even to get the check!! I've NEVER in my life experienced such HORRENDOUS SERVICE!! When my friends and I told the manager that; her response was ""Well don't come back to the restaurant then. I think the service is fine."" Hey with assholes like that running this restaurant neither me or any of my friends are ever returning!!! Restaurants with such crappy customer attitudes will hopefully run out of business soon!!!!"	1star
This is my new favorite restaurant in NYC, I keep raving to everyone about it. The ambience is wonderful and the food is amazing, service is always on point, very knowledgeable and professional, I can't wait to go back.	5star
Cute restaurant. Came at 6pm on a Saturday and it was already fairly packed.  We waited about 10 minutes for a table.   We ordered the Chirashi set, the salmon sushi set and the potato croquettes for appetizer. Portions were tiny and thankful we went with the set (a set adds soup, vegetables and steam egg) which help to fill the tummy. The sashimi on the Chirashi was cut in tiny cubes the size of maybe 3 jellybeans together. Hard to get the taste of the fish when they are that tiny.. And the quantity was very sparse.  The salmon sushi was fine but small quantity too.  Price was on the steep end but then again tip is already inclusive.  All in all, won't be returning.	2star
[495] This review is for breakfast. The restaurant is right across the street from our Hotel so we decided to give it a try for breakfast.    The place is nicely decorated which includes a bunch of outside tables which are perfect for people watching. Our waitress Angela was really nice and had conversations with my 8 year old.   Hubby had the lumberjack special which he enjoyed $20 Kid had two scrambled eggs (that's it) for $10 which he did not eat.  There were brown grill marks so he didn't want to eat it.  I suspect they didn't properly clean the grill area. I had the veggie omelet $15 which was eh.  My large omelet was bland and I didn't enjoy the potatoes.  They were not fresh ... if they were they were too perfect/squares and the whole wheat bread was cold and no jelly was offered. I won't be back for breakfast.	2star
If you're really in he mood to spend a lot of money on OKAY food, the aesthetic and ambiance is nice so come here! I've had better chicken/ waffles at BUBBYS. Their portions are too small for me so you end up ordering sides or smaller plates to make sure you leave full. It's ok for a first date but I personally won't go back after trying it once.	2star
The mix drink menu is very elaborate. No complaints there. We started of with the guacamole. I prefer mine with a bit more salt (that's a personal preference)  but  a healthy portion. They decorated the table with three homemade hot sauces. One of them was a habanero base. My wife got the carne asada. The meat was medium  rare and incredible tasty. It was a well marinaded beautiful cut of meat. It was served with tortilla that made be made with some whole grain. I went to the roots of Mexican with the posole. Theirs is the red. It was super yummy with the traditional sides. It brought me back to Acapulco. We were pleasantly filled and had to forgo the the desert. My wife did get one Mexican hot chocolate to go only to fight back mister freeze mister. Enjoy Worthy the journey yup Cute back yard yup	4star
I'm not going back since they changed their pricing scheme/size options. This was always a work go-to for me when they had the small size option for $8 which was the perfect portion. Now it's one larger size for $10 which is too much food so its back to the office cafeteria I go.	1star
The service is good but the food is horrible..it leaves a funky taste in your mouth...eont be coming here for the food again.	2star
Everything was good.  I've never been to Nashville, unfortunately, so I don't know how this compares to Prince's.  But hot or not, this is good fried chicken.  The meat is well seasoned, the skin nice and crisp.  Hot was pretty hot, but I think the extra hot version would be fine too.  All the sides were great - the greens were actually salted and seasoned well, an unfortunate rarity.  The mac and cheese was great - splurge and get it.  Corn bread too, it was of the sweet variety.   Fun place too, intimate seating and a friendly staff.	4star
My friend and I have been to this place about 10 times since last year.  Last week we went to enjoy some Happy Hour margaritas and some tapas.  We were disappointed.  The margaritas were good, but the tapas' prices went up (they used to have 3 tapas for $18; now the average price is about $10 for each tapa).  This is OK, the problem is that they advertise a pasta with oxtail tapa and all you get is a small pasta dish with tomatoe sauce and you have to get a magnifying glass to see the meat.  After we complained to the waitress, she said she would bring it up to the attention of the owner and chef.  The result was that she disappeared from our table and avoided us at all costs.  Not a very nice way to treat long time customers, in my opinion....I mean, for three more dollars you get a generous pasta dish with enough meat in any Italian restaurant.   WARNING:  The Happy Hour changed, too.  Check the prices before you order your drink just in case.  In these fiscally challenging times, you don't need a nasty surprise when you get your bill....	2star
Good food for reasonable prices. A friend and I were trying to decide on a restaurant in Chinatown for dinner. I was in the mood for dim sum and she was craving noodle soup, so naturally, we decided on Noodle Village. We split a plate of the Chinese broccoli, and it was okay - a little tough, but with a delicious sauce on the side. We also got two orders of the XLB (pork and crab). I prefer the pork, but both were very tasty. I also ordered a bowl of shrimp dumpling noodle soup which was decent - a little watery, but the dumplings were hearty. My friend had similar thoughts on her beef noodle soup. Our bill came out to be around $34 - not bad at all. The 5% discount from Yelp check-ins is only applicable from Monday through Thursday, however. We came at around 8PM on a Friday night and there were plenty of tables available. Service was friendly and more attentive than your average Chinatown establishment.	4star
I personally don't feel Roberta's is really worth it. I ordered the Cacio e Pepe pasta dish and it was maybe 15 strands of fettuccini pasta total. Also the taste of pepper was extremely over-powering. The pizza is tasty but only 6 small and thin slices, not the traditional 8- just something to keep in mind if you plan on sharing. If you are very hungry I would skip this place as the portions are very small and not filling.	2star
I really love this place.  Living on 23rd street, it's nice to have a bar close by that has a great combo of cheap (yummy!!) food, a great craft beer selection for incredibly reasonable prices ($6 for Brooklyn sorachi ace!) and a lovely outdoor seating area.  I've always had great experiences with the bar tenders, and that cheese burger has me coming back with cravings at least once a week.  Highly recommended.	5star
"Wish I could give this restaurant 5 stars, but the service was absolutely terrible. I have been here a few times, mainly for events/galas and I found the staff to be rather rude, but was willing to give it another shot as my cousin and his wife booked a reservation for dinner. First off, it took 15 minutes after our reservation time to get seated (and we were 15 minutes early before our reservation time). First off, no water for the first 20 minutes - asked three times for it. Then had to ask for bread three times (no exaggeration). Asked for a Rye Whiskey on the rocks - they delivered my cousin and his wife's drinks first (15 minutes after ordering them), then did not say why they didn't bring mine. I asked for my drink and the waiter said they're out of my whiskey. Why not say that when you place the drink order? Waited another 10 minutes for my new drink (a bourbon whiskey on the rocks). I get a small pour and it's neat, no ice. Then have to ask for ice - instead of bringing ice they remove my drink and bring it  back another 10 minutes later!!! So we order entrees with sides. Everyone's order comes with a side except mine - they drop the orders and leave in haste. I hail a waiter down and ask for my entree's side dish. They said ""it's coming right up,"" which is a lie since it comes 20 minutes later and I'm already finished with my pork loin. So irritating beyond words!!! Believe the terrible reviews - the food is mediocre at best and the service does suck. And if you eat there at night in the summer you will be eaten by mosquitoes and have hem land in your bread butter - we had 3 alone! Not worth it - eat outside the park. I've lived in NYC for 7 years and by far this is the crappiest service I've ever encountered. Don't do it. Go elsewhere!"	1star
Maybe I came on an off night? Brought a group of 8 here and in the spirit of not saying not nice things, let's just say I was embarrassed for choosing this place. Don't trust the tourists reviews!	2star
"~ Fish in the Poke bowl: 1.5 star ~ Rice in the Poke bowl: 2.5 star ~ Overall taste of the Poke bowl: 1 star ~ Condiments (spicy mayo, etc.): 2 star ~ Service: 2.5 star ~ Ambiance and vibe: 4 star This place does no justice to the poke scene popping up these days in New York. We got half and half and added some Poke to be able to sample all three proteins, and none of them were worthy of the price or quality.  The tuna and salmon tasted old, mushy, and bland, I didn't feel the seasoning. And the octopus was just down right nasty. Just don't get me started about the additional options, they were all bland with no taste. All the flavors of the ingredients combined (the bit that it had) made for a really nice Instagram shot with its vivid colors (who knows, maybe they gas the fish for redness), but that's when the celebration ended, I suppose I should of thrown out the bowl after the photo shoot (I will upload some pics so you can see how photogenic it is).  To be able to compare the Poke experience here, before my taste buds get diluted, I quickly went to Chikarashi, another Poke /Chirashi spot. What a difference in quality and taste.  I commend every Poke enthusiasts to do the same. get anything at Sons Of Thunder, than get the ""Sichuan Chili Salmon"" at Chikarashi (their other options on the menu are more Chirashi /scattered sushi than Poke), and see the difference for yourself. Moral of the story: I felt robbed walking out from Sons Of Thunder, especially for the price I paid ($23).  ________ Ps. So far, the most ""authentic"" Poke bowl I had In New York (Chikarashi is a japanese hawaiian fusion), was the tuna bowl at Smorgasburg (Williamsburg & prospect park) by a stand called East Coast Poke.  (I wrote my review while the experience was still fresh, I'll revise it later, and fix the errors.)"	1star
Okay... Since I still have my NOLA hangover, we finally searched for a good spot here the city to eat OYSTERS and found this place through YELP. We got there early, like 5pm (talk about being an early bird!  There are a bunch of people ahead of us though). We were sitting there for 10 minutes, debating on what to order, but when I looked around, the place was packed already! Sooo, we ordered a dozen of FRESH OYSTERS and it was sooo good! We paired it with beer and cider which is good as well. Since we came in early, half dozen of oysters and 1 glass of beer only cost 12 bucks! Not bad at all! We then ordered the FETTUCCINE WITH CLAMS which is buttery and creamy but not overwhelming. The pasta was al dente and the clams were cooked well! We also ordered the SCALLOP RISOTTO.  It was perfectly seasoned and the mushroom goes really well with the scallop. They can do better with the texture though. But all in all,we stil enjoyed it! There's no dessert menu so we asked for the WHISKEY CAKE! They said it was homemade. I say it was soook good! Our server (I forgot his name) was really helpful and was friendly enough even if the place was packed. The place was clean and nice (the restroom too!) and has that feel-good ambiance. All in all, we had a great time and will definitely come back to have the oysters and to try their beer steamed mussels and the rest of their menu.	5star
When my coworker told me about this spot and how delicious the food was, I just thought he was exaggerating. But holy cow it lived up to every word. We started with the steak lollipops which had 4 skewers with a few cubes of steak topped with (I'm guessing) chimchurrri sauce (excuse the spelling).... very tasty. For our main course we had the famous alcove burger and Cuban sandwich.. we took pictures anyway even tho there's tons on yelp. We decided to try the truffle fries and it was well worth it. I'm not even a big fan of truffle and I loved every bite! The burger itself was very tasty, had a hint of something sweet and just tasted very unique.  The sandwich was equally as tasty. The service was too notch, the wait staff were very attentive and helpful in offering any suggestions should you be stuck choosing. I will most definitely be returning and while I hate ordering the same food twice I think I may get the alcove burger again. The alcove has officially become my new place to get my burger fix!	5star
Nice presentation.  Ok food.  Nanoosh around the corner has more authentic and tasty middle eastern food.  Free cookie with review.	3star
Had a late dinner here which was really pleasant. The food was delicious and affordable (in my opinion), and the views from the patio outside were unreal. My only criticism was of the hostess who left us hanging for 30 minutes despite multiple tables being open (it was after 10 pm on a weekday, so it was hardly busy). However, this was made up for when we asked to have our table moved to a better one... we were accommodated quickly and the staff was incredibly nice about it. I'll be back.	5star
Just say yes to Uglyduckling.  I met up with my cousin for an early dinner(?). I had to choose between Uglyduckling and Cafe Luluc, which i like the name for Uglyduckling more (score). We had just missed brunch by 2.5 seconds, but that's ok because Chicken and Waffles are on the dinner menu (yes!).  I ordered deviled eggs for my app, nothing too crazy. My cousin had the mussels. OMG so good, that sauce makes me want to scream. Nice and flavorful. Dip the bread that comes with it into the sauce, a match made in heaven.  My Chicken and Waffles was the star of the show. Best I've ever had honestly. Waffles not too thick, just good enough for syrup sopping. Chicken seasoned to perfection, nice and juicy, accompanied by spicy aioli sauce (yum). I love spicy.  My cousin reported that her goat cheese salad with side of grilled salmon was great!  I ordered Sangria which was the flavor of the day. Can I suggest a Chicken and Waffle flavored sangria by Uglyduckling please?	4star
My husband and I were killing time before our reservation at Pok Pok.  We'd parked near this area and decided to check out Blueprint base on all the positive Yelp reviews. The space is narrow and the bar fills up most of the room though there are a few little tables along the wall.  When we entered, some people were leaving the bar area, so we took their spots.  The place was pretty crowded for a little before 5:00.  I thought that was a good sign. I had the Perry's Pimm's Cup.  It came in a tall glass with crushed ice and a sprig of mint for garnish.  The drink tasted pretty good, but I would have preferred more of a cucumber flavor.  That flavor was hidden in the background.  It's just a personal preference based on other Pimm's Cups that I've had before.  My husband had a whiskey based drink.  He said it was okay.   We weren't wowed, so we didn't opt for a second drink.  The service was good and our water was refilled frequently.  I would go back if I was in the area, but I wouldn't seek it out.	3star
It's more like a 3.5 star but rounded it down and will upgrade if my next visit warrants. I was in the Fort Greene and decided to check out this place given the generally positive review. The place is beautifully decorated with leather seats and a cute outdoor seating area. We shared a smoked vegetable flat bread as a starter. The veggies were tasty but I didn't taste any smoky flavor if there's any. The flat bread was pretty hard and dry. I suspect they froze the flat bread and just throw it on a grill or oven without thawing it. For the entree, wife and I got a bqe Salmon burger and their best seller chicken and waffle.  The salmon burger came with a hefty amount of crunchy fries covered in parmesan - they were really good. The salmon burger was ok. Something was off in their salmon seasoning. I think they put way to much oregano or something similar and it was over powering. Something with the fried chicken. The herb dominated the chicken flavor which made it taste a little weird. Otherwise the chicken was juicy and nicely fried. The waffle was really good. Moist and a little crispy on the outside. The waffle was probably the best thing of the entire meal. Overall it's a beautiful place to eat in but the food fell short of my expectation. Will only come back again if I am in the area.	3star
Nobody speaks english  Really dirty hole in the wall spot.. They don't even give you fresh bean sprouts and toppings for pho.. They just throw it all in your bowl .. Never again	1star

I'm bummed. We have been to Dominick's many times over the decades for the quintessential Arthur Ave Italian food experience.  Until last night they delivered a consistently great experience, but last night we had problems with 3 out of the 7 dishes we ordered. 1) Baked clams - clams were bad, sent them back, a few of us did not feel well that night, but no one is really sure. 2) Meatballs were dry and had no flavor.   3) Chicken Parmesan (not eggplant Parmesan) came out as perfectly shaped circles and heavily breaded.  Only way that would happen is FROZEN. Stuffed peppers- a special, were great Broccoli rabe - great Antipast salad - fine Ziti with Vodka - good  I can forgive the clams, but not the meatballs, and especially not  the chicken as it tells me there is something wrong.  If they ran out of chicken cutlet (??) they should have told us.  We actually got a 1/2 order of stuffed peppers for that same reason... we got the last 2. Like I said, I am bummed, and quite frankly could have gotten a much better meal much closer to home, like Testo's in Bridgeport, CT.  I can only assume Dominick's is coasting on its reputation catering to the tourist market. I see no reason to go back.	2star
Went for dinner with friends and we were so disappointed with the service, manager is oblivious to good service and accommodating patrons. It was a horrible experience.

Kuu Ramen NY Manhattan FiDi 2pm Friday 3rd April 2014 Four Stars On this warm but rainy Friday, I went to Kuu Ramen. I ordered the Ku chili chili ramen with chicken and a vegetable tempura ($18.5). The ramen came out within 3 minutes. I asked for it to stay but it still came in a to-go plastic bowl (which I think is standard procedure). The skinny ramen noodles were plentiful but a bit overcooked. The broth was fatty, spicy, and really delicious. The soft egg was perfectly boiled. The one large piece of chicken thigh was juicy. The chili strands, bamboo, and Naruto rounded out the dish. The tempura was freshly made. There were 2-3 pieces of Japanese Pumpkin, Chinese Broccoli, Green Beans, Carrots, Zucchini, and Eggplant. The dipping sauce was kind of bland.  Overall, good food, quick service, and reasonably priced.  Next time a chicken bowl.	4star

"Decided to come to Thursday Kitchen on a Friday nighg after seeing a friend's post having a cool ""light up"" drink. Essentially we came for their popular Adult Capri Suns and decided to have dinner her as well while we were at it. There was an hour and half wait, but it actually moved quickly and the experience was worth it.  Drinks: It seems that Thursday Kitchen is known for their Adult Capri Suns, which are essentially a choice out of four different flavors of juicy cocktails in a big Capri Sun like bag and with ""light up icecube"" that changes colors. They're each $9 and it seems that everyone in the restaurant had one.  I tried the Lychee Rich Rain (soju, lychee, mango) and the Pure Jeremy (soju, muddled strawberries, Korean yuzu). The Lychee Rich Rain was ok, but would definately recommend the Pure Jeremy which was delicious -- the bartender said this was their most popular choice.  Food: The waiter told us that given the then of the restaurant was tapas-style, that generally it takes about two dishes per person. However we had three between two of us and that was sufficient for us, four with dessert.  They had a decent variety of vegetarian and pescetarian options, which was great! We started off with the Ugle Potato (Crispy Fingerling Potato, Feta Cheese, Smoky BBQ Sauce) ($8) as the appetizer -- this was our favorite dish, very tasty and delicious! For entrees, we ordered the Mapo Tofu (Tofu, Radish Kimchi, Fermented Chili Bean Sauce, and House Made Tortilla Chips) ($11). Be careful, this is very spicy. I enjoyed the spice and dish overall, but my friend couldn't eat this dish due to the spice level of it. The waiters do warn you about the spice prior to your order, so only order if you can handle very spicy food.  The second shared entree we ordered was the Gnocchi (Korean Chili Pepper Sauce, Garlic Aioli, and Seaweed Crunch) ($10). Again I enjoyed the dish, but my friend couldn't have this dish either due to the spice level, however I thought it was less spicy than the Mapo Tofu dish, definitely still has a kick to it. I did feel that there weren't enough pasta in the dish, regardless the it was complemented well by the Cauliflower in the dish.  For dessert, we got the Popcorn Ice Cream (Salted Caramel Sauce) ($9), which had a delicious popcorn-salty-buttery taste to it.  Service: The service was great and all the staff, from the bartenders to the waiters to the check-in guy were very nice and friendly. They were patient, helpful and generally took their time in explaining each dish after it arrived on the table.  Atmosphere: Lively, young and ""popping"" for a lack of a better term. Great place for a date night or a night out with friends. The crowd mostly was young people, essentially college students and young professionals.  Overall, Thursday Kitchen was a blast and I can't wait to come back here!"	4star
Beautiful hidden gem. With it's otherworldly charm, one feels like you're a part of history in this previous glass factory. The ambiance is lovely, the staff is equally as charming as the space. The open kitchen is really cool. The infamous rabbit was not on the menu when I was there however my table had one dish of every meat and it was to die for. Excellent food. Lovely space. I recommend it simply for the ambiance alone.	5star
This is a cute little place to eat dim sum in Chinatown! They have these carrot flavored pork buns that are super cute and tasty! I love the crystal shrimp dumplings, shiu Mai, and chicken feet! You can get free hot tea or water. Since this is a mom and pop shop ran by an old couple, it does take some time for them to make the food and process payment though. Overall, it was a great experience!	4star
Unique and delicious drinks! Bartender was very honest about the menu and nothing I tried was anything less than spectacular. Brussel sprout hash made my tummy very happy	5star
Came here for my mom's birthday dinner and had a decent time. I started off with a rum punch and I honestly thought it was a fruit punch and finished it in two minutes . Very weak, no booze wouldn't order again. My entree was the salmon crusted in corn. That was delicious but a very small portion of fish. My side was the spinach and the coconut rice. The garlic spinach was delicious but the coconut rice was just sad. I would skip that entirely. I was still hungry after my meal which for the price of the bill was not acceptable. I think I would come here again for the weekly specials like Taco Tuesday but I would not eat here for dinner again.	3star
Bad cocktails. Their menu has a lot of options which look really good, but we were consistently disappointed with every option we got including the DTH old fashioned, the margarita on tap, the Mexican Murder Inc and more. Stick to beer here.	2star
Super delicious! In town for a conference and looked on yelp for a quick, semi-healthy dinner for one. As a native Texan without access to good Mexican where I live it seemed like a good option.  They did not disappoint! Let's just say that these tacos are a flavor explosion and some in authentic style.  I tried the chicken, steak and pork. They were all great but I preferred the chicken and steak in that order. The pork was more of a savory earthy flavor than the others and it was spicier. Not a bad thing, but it did have more kick.  All in all, a surprisingly affordable and delicious option in the middle of Times Square. Don't forget the horchata when you're there! Yum!	5star
I LOVE THIS PLACE!!  This was truly a 5 star experience from the food to the service. They don't have an extensive menu but they don't need it because everything is executed perfectly and the food is just SO GOOD.  I've had the pleasure to visit this restaurant in London on my first time and it left a lasting impressions months after I came back. So I was super excited when I found out they were opening one in NYC. Now I heard there is actually another location within NYC (will be going to that!). This experience was definitely different from my first experience because they had a bit more options. I chose the Combo #2 which was burgers, lobster, fries & dessert. Everything was super delicious literally can't complain. The dessert....We chose to share the strawberry cheesecake mousse and the salted caramel gelato....AGAIN...SUPERB!! You can tell they actually made the strawberry sauce from scratch and the mousse was perfect. Also that was the best damn salted caramel I've tasted in my 29 years of being on this earth.  I will come back here any chance I get. I'm SO looking forward to visiting the other location. STAY TUNED.	5star
Very busy brunch spot, but worth the wait. Waiting 20+ min for table on Sunday afternoon...  had a burger which was delicious w/ fries.    Friends had some egg dishes.... which they enjoyed. Staff was very friendly and attentive..... will def go back.    Coffee was only ok, but chilled irish coffee cocktail was inventive and tasted good... just but a bit too much cream	4star
Went all out at brunch here with my BF and had zero regrets. We shared a 1/2 fried chicken, mini cheddar waffles and mac and cheese. Chicken is definitely on par with competitors like Pies n Thighs and Sweet Chick, and the mac and cheese might just be my new favorite in the city. Waffles were delicious, too. Decent service and the best part is that they accept brunch reservations! Who even does that??	5star
DON'T COME HERE!  After reading many positive reviews my boyfriend and I decided to check it out.  The service and drinks were okay at best.  At the end of the night (after one drink) my boyfriend accidentally left his card with the bill.  We called the next day to get the card back.  The person said they would retrieve it and call us back, but they never did.  Soon after calling, chase alerted us that fraudulent charges were being made on the card. Not worth risking employee theft for what was a very mediocre experience.  I do not recommend wasting your time.	1star
Made a reservation for a Tuesday night at 6pm, which I would suggest doing as well! Best to get there when they first open. I had the pasta served out of the wheel of cheese and it was fun to get an delicious. The portions were small but I was actually full when I left. The desserts are also small so plan on getting your own!	5star
Definitely overrated and a disappointment considering the price and yelp's reviews. Japanese food is my favorite type of cuisine and I was pretty disappointed with the overall experience here.  Ambiance - The decor is nice on the first floor but the second floor doesn't match it, which is where I was sitting.  Food - The food overall was just okay. I got the croquette appetizer, cold soba and the chirashi. The only two things that stuck out to me was the house made soba sauce and the freshness of the fish in the chirashi. But the chirashi had a handful of very small diced pieces of fish and was a small entree. The pieces were so small that it just gave the impression of odd bits of left over fish that didn't cut it for nigiri/maki. The other small dishes that came with it were not so great - the miso soup was overdone with too many added ingredients, the egg custard thing had no flavor, the pickles were okay. Everything else was standard and nothing that was really great.  Service - the server was spotty and took a while to come back to our table. I think he was overwhelmed since there did not seem to be any other servers on the second floor.  I would not recommend this restaurant since I think you can put your money to better use elsewhere.	2star
Heaven on earth. The best pizza I've ever had!  This place fills up fast but is definitely worth the wait! Make sure to try the bee sting... it's not always on the menu but they will make it for you. It has the most incredible chili honey you will ever try! Service is great as well!  Make sure to grab a chili oil on your way out :)	5star
Surprisingly UNDERWHELMING. The ambiance is cool, just wish the music selection wasn't left up to a staffer with 'MF DOOM' pandora radio station. We were there as a party of 3 to dine casually on a Saturday Evening and boy you get greeted by frizzy haired unprofessional hostess'.  Okay, she's just a hostess. Next our first waiter asked us if we wanted drinks/water. No introduction, no name, nothing. Okay cool. Our waitress then comes over, doesn't introduce herself just wants to know what we want to drink. Feeling a bit pressured we went with an bottle of wine. Their selection is GREAT. The sommelier was top notch.  Overall our food experience was not great. Their crab cake is weak. All filler no jumbo lump crab meat for the price tag of $28. Oysters were superbly fresh. Our entrees were hit and miss. The halibut is heavenly, cooked to perfection but sides lacked flavor/seasoning.  Upon every encounter with the wait staff they seemed numb and dead inside. We were hardly done with dinner then all of a sudden the check was placed on our table. The restaurant was NOT packed nor was there a wait.  No fair well, nor thank you upon exit. Not the way service should be. I understand some waiters might hate their jobs, but damn what a mistake coming here.  Go elsewhere for a better experience. This place is not worth the $300 price tag for dinner.  P.S., the music selection was atrocious for the kind of environment we were in. They played MF DOOM, Drake, Whitney Houston, and Future??? Get your shit together. Please.	2star
Don't get the pho, it's very mediocre. Other dishes were way better. This is a very trendy, asian fusion place. Good for date night or dinner with friends. I liked the vibe but the food isn't authentic. If you're looking for dank pho, move along.	3star
OH MY the eel tacos!! The eel is so tender, it literally melted in my mouth and caressed my tongue with its lusciousness. The last time I had such good eel was in Japan. The crispy chicken was spot-on and generous in quantity - enough to feed three. The Angry Sweet Potato delivered perfectly baked non-greasy fries, with sriracha goat cheese - which elevated the taste & texture of dipping sauce to another level! They're definitely onto something here at Thursday Kitchen!	4star
I'm usually not a huge steak fan, but this place has some mouth watering steak! I would recommend getting the steak rarer than you normally do because the meat continues to cook on the plate. So if you usually like medium rare, order rare.  The creamed spinach was one of my favorite sides ( I wish there was creamed corn ). The bacon is a must try as well. I wouldn't say it's my favorite steak place, but the service and experience was worth while.	4star
I finally made it here and am glad I did; as with most Asian places, there's always something for a vegan to eat. I got the Knife-Peeled noodles in a tofu noodle soup; the tofu was served on the side. Wonderful, chewy noodles in a vegetable broth, served in a bowl so large I got to take home a pint. Dumpy and divey? Yes--and we liked it that way! (We loved it!) Jasmine tea served in a styrofoam cup. Really happy I chose to walk down Doyers Street today; I'll definitely go here again--and now I'll be checking out Xi'an, since there's a location a few blocks from where I live.	4star
Just had another Luke's lobster roll after having spent nearly a week in Maine and the Massachusetts Bay Area, where I had lobster rolls nearly daily. Then offering at Luke's certainly holds its own with the best of them, though I cannot say the same for the poppy seed slaw, which I didn't care for much.	4star
My husband and I love trying new restaurants and are not afraid to venture out and try different things. So being a yelp girl and a food critic I decided to follow the reviews and try a good Thai place on upper west side.  We thought it's gonna be great, so we walked for 30 blocks to get to it getting excited.  The place is tiny, a bit cramped, but even that's ok.  We should have known since there was no one inside not to go in.  We ordered mixed appetizers which were tiny for 14$ , but decent. And then we ordered cashew shrimp from the wok menu and a crabmeat fried rice.  Let me tell you, the fried rice was OVERCOOKED, with NO TASTE. The only thing you can taste was the rice, there was no crabmeat at all, I dug around to find it and there was not a one piece. So I ended up not even eating the dish. Mind you that ball of just overcooked rice was 18$  And the cashew shrimp was bad as well.  The shrimp was not cleaned properly and the sticky rice we paid extra for had no taste and was just like regular cooked white rice.  Overall a TERRIBLE experience, do not recommend this restaurant.  Don't know how they managed to mess up Thai food that is so rich in flavor and spices.  Terrible.  And super expensive	1star
We came here late one night and were seated right away. Service was prompt the entire time. I ordered a watermelon cocktail, which was light and even more lightly sweetened, which I enjoyed. We ordered the truffle fries, light on the parmesean and the vietnamese wing. The truffle fries came out soggy but we enjoyed the taste so we ordered another order and asked them if they could make sure it wasn't soggy this time. Second order came out less soggy but they forgot to go light on the Parmesan. The vietnamese wings were well cooked but really sweet. It was all in all an okay experience but I probably wouldn't come again.	3star
I found Rubirosa through Yelp and decided to give it a try when my friend was visiting in town.  It was a rainy Wednesday night and I got to the restaurant at around 7:15. The hostess told me that the wait for 2 people would be around half an hour and probably less than 40 minutes so my friend and I headed to Bar Pa Tea first.  We ended up getting seated in a little less than under an hour.  My friend and I ordered a half-half Bianca and Tie-Dye, as well as a small Cavatelli, which was recommended by our waitress. The pasta came first, and it was delicious! It was a perfect balance of flavors, and the pasta was cooked al dente to perfection. You can really taste the difference of handmade pasta. I really liked the pesto on the Tie-Dye, and if you like ricotta then the Bianca is a must. I'm generally not a huge fan of thin crust, but the flavors were really good.  Total came out to around $45 after tax and tip. Overall, not bad for a restaurant that is basically in SoHo. The wait wasn't bad for us since we weren't that hungry and we got ice cream while we were waiting, but I still don't think it was worth an hour.	4star
Overall is ok. The service was good, however, I felt the food is slightly better in an other gyukaku store in midtown.	3star
Went back for the first time since the new chef. Still pretty delicious, even without the big rabbit dish - enjoyed the tilefish, the Syrian cheese, the fava beans and the rabbit tacos. The service was fine - though it was pretty hot (it was a hot night) and pretty loud.	4star
FOOD POISONING!!! BEWARE! So sad I used to love coming here :( I took my mother while she was visiting from Florida. I was really excited to come. Unfortunately they've changed some of their policies. We came around lunchtime and were refused seating near the windows, even though there was adequate seating available. We proceeded to order an appetizer which was just absolutely tiny with huge price tag. I had ordered the cedar plank salmon, which came out completely RAW!! Uncooked! I realized this after I took a bite! Yuk!!! They took it back to the kitchen to re cook, which I hate! Did not remove it from my bill....  On top of that he had the audacity to add gratuity. Really??? And to put the cherry on top of it I got food poisoning!!!! Needless to say I will be giving my credit card company a call! And filing a report with the health department!!!! Very unfortunate this is one of my favorite places in the city. Management you really need to step up your game, just because you're a tourist spot doesn't mean you need to neglect your patrons! Shame on you!	1star
The food is good, but not as amazing as I was led to believe by the reviews. The space is cramped and the prices are also uncomfortably high.	3star
Almar is an affordable, delicious brunch option in DUMBO. Casual walk in, cute space with an assortment of small and large communal tables. Service is friendly and attentive, at least at this hour of the day. There will be people with babies most likely. So if you have an allergic reaction to strollers you may want to steer clear.  The Egg in a Cloud is awesome. They make a light as air, fluffy egg white supporting a baked yolk while pairing it with smokey ham and fontina.  The Almar Breakfast Sandwich isn't breaking any new ground, but it's far superior to most Egg/Meat/Cheese breakfast sandwiches you will encounter due to the ingredients used.  If you veer towards the sweeter side in the morning (or just want dessert), they also have a Nutella Panini which should not be missed.  Solid Brunch Cocktails that extend beyond the usual Bloody Mary also round out a good morning selection.  Will return and plan to check out for dinner.	4star
I recently ordered for the first time, and had high expectations, boy was I disappointed smh. The food was over cooked, empanadas were tiny & on the burnt side. I felt the price didn't match the portions. Overall this place was meh.  Probably won't re order again :/	2star
Came here for my birthday dinner tonight. Customer service was phenomenal. Food wasn't bad. I thought some of the texture could have been better. For example, the crunchy tofu kimchi was too dry.  The beef noodles in the japchae was too soggy. The tiger roll was great and so were the organic BJ wings. The truffle fries needed more truffles. The best part of the night was our seafood tower . Very fresh! Our waiter Miguel was very nice and attentive. I got a nice Tiramisu cake at the end of the dinner as a free dessert in celebration of my bday . Thank you for a great night!	4star
The food and drinks themselves were fine. However, the restaurant jacked our bill way up by foisting guacamole on us. We were at the bar before getting seated at a table and were offered Chips & Salsa or Chips & Guac. We said CHIPS & SALSA. But they brought us Chips & Guac and we were too embarrassed or polite to say no. But then the bill came and Chips & Guac was $14 DOLLARS. Our bill for 2 margaritas and 2 entrees and chips/guac came out to be $78 before tip and this was pretty ridiculous because dinner was fine but we were NOT looking to spend $40/50 each and the fact that the restaurant pushed it on us was not cool for us. You wouldn't choose to throw a $10 bill into the wind and that's basically what happened.	2star
This place is the real deal! We came here with the intention of having a small snack before lunch, but those plans were quickly foiled. Our order consisted of one pork belly taco each and an order of breakroom fries. The breakroom fries can be described as gluttonous greatness. Egg, bacon, pork belly, cheese, green onion, and jalapeños on top of fries AND tots. (yes AND). The pork belly tacos were fantastic as well. Each bite melted in my mouth with an explosion of flavor. This is a great place to check out in Chinatown for both a quick bite and filling meal. I'll be back to try a burger in the future.	5star
"Believe the hype! At Peter Luger you can get the best porterhouse steak you might ever eat in your entire lifetime! When getting steak here, it's like getting high-quality sushi omokase-style--you have to eat it right as it's finished being prepared. As hours pass, the food exponentially gets less good (maybe I'm over exaggerating). Albeit, the pizza-rule still applies where if you save it for later and eat it cold, microwaved, or oven-heated, it will still be amazing. Pro tips: 1) Don't get your porterhouse steak cooked any more than medium rare. 2) ""Steak for 1"" may be good for 2 people, ""steak for 2"" may be good for 3 people, etc. 3) Make a reservation! 4) If you're gonna get some booze here, stick to wine and beer--don't get ripped off with the cocktails--see below. I can't give this place 5 stars because I ordered an old-fashioned with too much ice and a no-named whiskey for $15--not cool. The bartender also seemed kinda New York-snobby. They do have Bitberger, a yummy German beer, for your tasting pleasure. If you're a steak-person, you're in NY, and want some good protein--check out Peter Luger."	4star
"I had a mediocre meal here, with service that was even worse. I came here around lunchtime with my friends and I asked for the uni + ikura on rice special. The waitress was like ""oh, we don't have that today. If you wanted to order it, it would be like $50 dollars""...... Okay? First of all, why'd you tell me all that? I don't care and I definitely didn't ask you to give me an explanation that makes absolutely no sense at all. If you don't have it today, then you don't. Oh wait but you do, but for $50? I felt very weird and confused after, but whatever. So I ordered tonkotsu ramen and some sort of crunchy sushi roll (sorry I don't remember which one). Sushi was alright, I was so hungry so I overlooked the fact that it had a lot of rice and not that much fish despite it being $7.50. I could get a better maki rolls elsewhere for much cheaper. It took quite a quite a while for the ramen to come out, long after the sushi was devoured. I'm not an impatient person but I've never waited that long for ramen before.  At last, the ramen came and it was pretty disappointing. The first thing I noticed was the well-done poached egg. If I wanted half a hard boiled egg, I would have made it at home thank you. The pieces of pork belly were sad and small, had no flavor, and the broth wasn't that flavorful either. After all this, we were in the mood for dessert and omg the waitress kept walking around but she would JUST NOT LOOK OVER OUR WAY FOR THE LONGEST TIME. Everytime she walked somewhere she would make sure she had her back to us almost like it was on purpose. It was so hard to get her attention. My friend finally successfully called her over and she was like ""I'm sorry about that"" okay so you know you were ignoring us, that's cool, but at least she was friendly. It would have been great if the waitresses were more attentive so we wouldn't have to sit here and waste so much of our time doing absolutely nothing but trying to get their attention.  My friend asked to order the green tea cheese cake with ice cream, and the waitress asks her ""Do you want ice cream with it for an extra $2?"" The pictures all over the wall literally say ""cheese cake WITH ice cream"" for $7 so what do you mean extra $2? My friend said she was fine without ice cream but later on, the waitress comes by and tells her that the ice cream indeed did come with it. Moving on, I got the green tea/red bean crepe cake and I was disappointed. It was small, did not taste good and was not worth $8. I was excited to try this place out since reviews didn't seem bad, and it was the only ramen place in Queens. Needless to say, I was disappointed and fed up by my experience here today and thinking about it still triggers me."	2star
Overpriced. Ootoya in Japan is so cheap, it pisses me off when the chain hikes up the price just because they are from Japan and they are in NyC. Can get similar quality for a lot cheaper at other restaurants. Way way way overpriced	1star
After having a less than favorable experience the manager assured me that I would be receiving a gift certificate for all the trouble.  Well over a year has past and several promises broken with still nothing ever received.  I was told the first time it must have been lost in the mail. Now 3x lost?  Poor customer service and very poor follow up.  Looks like I'll be scratching this restaurant off my list.	1star
Got lucky to be seated after 10 minutes on a Friday night for dinner! Woohoo parties of two. They have sushi bar seating, regular tables, and the long communal tables where we got seated next to another party. No bother! I was excited to see there were small dishes outside of ramen. Our choices: 1) Pork belly bun: Perfect ratio of fat and meat. I'm not a fan of super fatty cuts, and this place did it well. It was well seasoned, and the meat was tender and juicy. The bao itself was also fluffy and melty. I appreciated that it was not only fresh (and therefore, fluffy), but also thin enough so that the pork belly flavor was not overshadowed by bun bites.  2) Soft shell crab bun: Amazing. I am never disappointed by soft shell crab dishes - this was the first time I've had it uniquely in a white bao. There was some sort of chili sauce (not spicy) which added a ton of flavor, and the pickled cucumbers complemented very well. A must get!! 3) Pig ears: Oh my gooood. I think this and the soft shell crab were my favorite. I would come back again and again for these little guys. For $9, portions were substantial. Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside. Because pig ears are very fatty, it was great that they were cut up into thin slices. Just like steak fries mmmm. 4) Tsukemen (dipping ramen): This was only okay. The noodles were too thin for dipping ramen IMO. Not sure if all the noodles for the other ramens were the same, but it wasn't the best for dipping. The tonkotsu broth was flavorful, but the noodles are supposed to be the star of the dipping show!  5) Sake: I prefer hot sake over cold sake. They serve the sake glasses in a wooden box, and pour it so it overflows into the box. Symbolizes abundance (or fortune), apparently. Cute :-)  10/10 would come back. Especially to try the other ramens.	4star
This place is overrated. I've been here a bunch of times. I have family from Brooklyn. The pizza is a hit or miss for me. Sometimes too much dough. The sauce is way to acidic for me. We ate in the restaurant many times but last night the hostess was so so so rude. She shouldn't be working there if she is going to have a negative attitude. The food is ok. I've had better.	3star
Unfortunately the food is not that good.  The place does look warm and welcoming but lacks quality and execution on their food.  I've had the ceviche which is tasteless and doesn't feel fresh at all and for the quantity they serve it seems overpriced.  Also the fried plantains are dull and they weren't properly fried.  The Baja fish tacos are ok, nothing special.  I live close by and rarely go, perhaps every 4 months and every time I remember the reason I don't order more often.	2star
Me and two friends came around 10:30am on a Sunday and waited 1.5 hours...are you kidding me? I'm just going to tell you right now it's completely not worth the wait. Don't get me wrong, the food is really good, but it's definitely not worth a 1.5hour wait. It's surprising that the wait is so long because Clinton basically occupies two stores--there are tons of tables and seats. I guess too many people are down for this ridiculous wait...there isn't much to see around the area either, so my friends and I just decided to sit down at the bench outside the door.  My friend and I ordered the Blueberry Pancakes with maple butter and Spanish scramble (comes with toast and potato hash), to share. My other friend ordered the breakfast plate with 3 eggs (any style), biscuit, potato hash, and bacon/sausage. The pancakes were good but I've definitely had fluffier pancakes before...the Spanish scramble was also good but c'mon it's just scrambled eggs with some hash and toast. Idk, it's really hard to convince myself that this place is worth the wait. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon unless the wait is 30 minutes or less.	2star
Appears I've had a similar experience to what others have had...TERRIBLE.  Food was ok, service was abysmal and the scene is boring.  We were overcharged and then blamed for not catching it earlier.  They had charged our cards before we did the math and caught their mistake (added meals from another table to our bill).  It ended up taking 3 weeks and about 10 phone calls to get the charges reversed.  Miserable experience. Decent food at a crazy price and make sure you check your bill.  Plenty of better options in the West Village.  I'd know, lived on Bleecker and MacDougal for 3yrs.	1star
This place has nice decor and overall has a very good vibe. We also had an amazing waiter! He was a blonde man with a beard, who was friendly and willing to explain so much of the menu! He was so helpful when it came to ordering!  The first thing we ordered was the griddled bread and tahini sauce an it was amazing! The griddled bread was so flakey and really something you cannot miss if you go to this restaurant! Also the cocktails are really great. The Persian Gold which I believe is gin, tonic, saffron, and an orange liqueur was really refreshing. Really a great drink and the saffron really added a nice touch. Overall the food was good, but less than I expected. I think this restaurant has the basis to be great, but I think they go overboard with the large amount of sauces on their entrée meals. The lamb dumpling was quite good but the sauce was quite overpowering. Overall, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a good meal.	4star
Just went here for Memorial Day Weekend with my Shanghainese relatives and was super disappointed. Food at this location is subpar and definitely not as good as the other locations. Staff could not speak Shanghainese. The green beans with pork were not good/authentic at all (it was flash fried, rather than dry fried/flattened, and had no flavor), the scallion pancake was flavorless, the soup dumplings were hit or miss on whether there was actually soup in it, and the hot and sour soup had a funky taste which was not surprising, considered they added an unorthodox ingredient, shrimp. The only thing that was good was a vegetable dish we got, but only because it's pretty hard to screw up--even I could make it.  I grew up going to the Flushing location and I used to frequent the Chinatown location when I was a student. The food at those locations are much better and more authentic than at this midtown location, and you will actually find Shanghainese staff there. I highly would not recommend this location to anyone.	1star
It took a while for us to get seated and when we finally did, we were in a crammed corner by the bathroom. The place looks spacious but in reality it isn't. For the appetizer we had meatballs and they were very delicious. Then, I ordered a small half white the other half margherita and my boyfriend made up his own pie. And for drinks we only wanted water which came in these tiny see through plastic cups... overall it wasn't worth it. The pizza is bland and everything is overpriced. Our waiter had no patience with us which made our experience worse. The bill came out to a whopping 80$ and it's a cash only restaurant. There are way better pizza places around that actually have taste and care about their customers!	2star
The staff was very friendly and service was prompt. I ordered a crab roll and it was delicious! The seafood was fresh and the roll was crisp and buttery. Sides (e.g., chips , slaw) are available for an extra charge.	5star
charming location and decor but the food was average. I was not impressed by the meat, i did not even finish my dishes. It's not worth the price at all. They only had one server for the entire restaurant who was very friendly but not quick. I could see a supervisor (or owner) roaming but he would not get in to help when I was clearly tying to get someone to pay for the bill. i would not recommend and most likely not return.	2star
I was going to make a delivery by phone but the lady was extremely rude she would put me on hold every 2 seconds and had an attitude problem so i decided to hang up and order online,... The jalea was very good ,... But the chicken was a bit dry ,... Not worth the price !!!!!!!!	1star
Went here with my wife for Dinner on a Monday night and sat outside.  The restaurant, outdoor seating and service are very nice. The food, portion sizes and prices....not so much. We orderered the crispy baby artichokes which were ok but not nearly as good as they used to be at Dumont and very expensive. My wife ordered the ribs.  For the price you pay you only get three ribs which is a crazy ripoff in any city. I ordered the Salmon.  Tasted very fishy and whatever it was placed on was gross only ate a few bites and did not finish. If you only want to have a drink this place might be ok but we don't drink we came for a delicious meal because of the yelp reviews.  I will now be very weary of yelp reviews in the future as this restaurant is a place we will never return to. With so many options in the neighborhood why waste your money? 2 apps 1 entree no alcohol only water = $80 with tip.	2star
"Worst customer service in all of manhattan. The waiter is talking to other people like he is friends with them and had nothing to do with seating them or taking their orders. All while ignoring us on line. He seated people behind us and completely ignored us. The guy behind the bars also ignored us and was very rude. I asked him if he can clear the tables from other people who sat at the bar and his response was one of the rudest I've ever seen. He said ""ok yeah"" with the biggest attitude.  Ashame that this place has such a high rating. Just have paid or bribed for reviews Bc the customer service is one of the worst I have ever encountered. And I thought French restaurants had class..  Good thing there are many other classy French restaurants in NYC to try where customer service is valued"	1star
After trying so many soup dumpling places in New York City, this spot has to be one of the best! I would be coming here more often if it wasn't so far from me. The soup dumplings are juicy and flavorful - you can even see the workers freshly wrapping the dumplings and steaming it. I would also recommend ordering the scallion pancake or scallion pancake wrapped with beef. The stir fry noodles were also pretty good but was a bit too oily and didn't have enough vegetables. Overall, you can't go wrong with coming here for delicious soup dumplings for a reasonable price. Just make sure you remember to bring cash since they are a cash only establishment.	4star
food is absolutely fantastic. welcome addition to the neighborhood. very happy it's here and equally happy that it seems to be doing so well.  i just want to make a suggestion to the owners or managers: please play different music. all we heard tonight was top 40 music from the last 20 years. didn't go with the vibe of the place at all. i wouldn't want to hear that music in ANY restaurant. maybe try some thievery corporation or buddha lounge mixes...  there are so many other musical options that would compliment everything you have going for you already. otherwise fantastic. looking forward to coming back soon. :)	5star
As self-proclaimed brunch queen, I have had my fair share of long wait times at popular brunch places, both at home in the Bay Area and here in NYC. Friedman's had a record wait time of an hour and a half for our party of three, and if I am being honest, the food wasn't worth the long wait.  The restaurant is a bit disjointed at the moment as it seems to have overtaken the neighboring cafe or deli that has gone out of business and is using the space for additional seating. The vibe of this additional seating area is not as nice as the vibe and decor of the original restaurant seating area, and I do hope they are going to transform that space somehow. However, when you're starving on a Saturday early afternoon and you've been waiting what seems like forever for food, you'll happily sit on the floor if it means you can finally get some food in your stomach. When we were finally seated, I ordered the nova benny, which is essentially an eggs Benedict that comes on top of a potato hash and salmon instead of the English muffin. The nova benny was tasty and I gobbled it up in about 5 minutes because of how hungry I was, but it wasn't the best eggs Benedict I've ever had. However I would recommend it as it was tasty and it is one of the dishes Friedman's is known for. I ordered a strawberry bellini as a drink, and I was unimpressed with this drink. It was not sweet and had weird textural issues as the drink kept separating, and it wasn't smooth in consistency. I say pass on the bellinis. Overall, Friedman's is an ok brunch place, and I would want to come back again if it didn't have such a long wait time.	3star
"This review is not based on the food, this review is based on our entire experience. So I book a reservation through open table for today 12/11/16 for 7:30pm. I got the confirmation and then in the morning I get another email saying your ""reservation has been canceled by the restaurant"" it's our final night in NY so we wanted to have our final dinner at River Cafe. So I was pissed off I called the restaurant spoke to this guy named Josh (I think that was his name) and he said open table is the one that canceled your reservation, open table didn't cancel my reservation I have an email that clearly states my reservation was canceled by the restaurant. Josh gave me a stupid excuse my credit card was declined (first of all I have a $30k limit) there is no way that credit got declined I even called my credit card company and they said you didn't have any declines.  And then Josh offers us a table for 10pm he said that's the best he can do. Puts me on hold to get my reservation reserved comes back 2 mins later and says I'm sorry we can't take you guys tonight I can put you on for another night (I've already told him tonight was our last night we are flying back tomorrow)  Anyways this was a big joke. Horrible service and even more horrible personality wth a bunch of lies."	1star
I've been here a few more times since my initial review.  - Appetizers are ok. Get them if you need to fill a void. Same with dessert. - I love Italian. This place isn't a straight up Italian joint. I would come back for the uni pasta (as an uni lover) and the tobiko shiso spaghetti. The latter had more flavor and depth. If you don't love uni, don't get the pasta. It's made for uni lovers and there is a decent portion of fresh uni. These two dishes are why I still rate it 4 stars.  - Now, if you like Parmesan cheese the Parmesan cheese wheel dish is worth the hype and presentation but it may be delayed since they have to push the wheel to serve table side and it's a pretty popular dish.  - Half portions are available for all of the pastas. They will be priced a little over 50% of the full portion cost for 50% of the portion size.	4star
I wanted to love this place given its historical significance in Harlem and all the rave but I just couldn't. The 2 stars was for the friendly service of our waitress, whose name I can't remember. Came here on a whim since I was staying in Harlem for the week, a lot of folks recommend I try it out. The place was crowded. Wait time was 5 mins, place was full. Inside decor had paintings of famous celebrities and political figures. Lots of options to choose from on the menu.  Ordered chicken and waffles, fried okra, Mac n cheese, collard greens, grits, and had cornbread. Out of everything we had I'd say the Okra and cornbread was my favourite.  Fried chicken was just tasteless had no flavour. PLEASE FLAVOUR YOUR DISHES. UNLESS YOU'RE COOKING FOR A NURSING HOME THEN THATS OK BUT SEASON THE DAMN DISHES. How can someone ruin Mac n cheese? I never thought I'd say this but sometimes too much cheese can ruin a dish. The roux or cheese was just too salty. And make sure the cheese is melted in the damn mac n cheese. Grits were lumpy as heck again no flavour. I read and heard so many folks talk about how much flavour these dishes had but dang their tastebuds must be shot cause what I tasted was BLAND, BLAND, BLAND! Honestly my grandmother's cooking would've sufficed, my comparison was based off of her standard of cooking soul food. Dissapointed with my experience here. NOT RECOMMENDING IT TO ANYONE!	2star
The worst customer service I ever had! We ordered a rice ball with miso sauce and it had really bad taste and we couldn't eat it And when we ask the waiter to replace it, she told us that once we ordered something from the kitchen and we received it we can't return it. This is not the way to treat customers. We will never come back again.	1star
I'm assuming people really come here for the ambience.  The food is average and nothing to come back for a second time.  I came here with some friends for brunch and came to find out that they had no Almond or Soy Milk, out of most dishes on the menu and the maple syrup they make was just ok.  I would have preferred Almond Milk with coffee and some decent maple syrup.  The waiter was either sleep walking while waiting our table or just had no personality.  Isn't that something you look for when hiring staff?   I ordered an omelette and some pancakes which were both average and left me hungry when I left the restaurant.  Maybe come in for a drink and to check out the decor.	2star
This place is definitely quality. I would probably give it five stars, but it is just a tad too pricy for Italian food. Aside from that, great service and presentation. The food is consistently good. The menu provides Italians usuals, as well as their spin on dishes. Lots of variety.	4star
"Saturday early dinner Group of five One of my friends from Chiang Mai, northern Thailand knew about the restaurant and she was very excited to dine here.  Watermelon Slaw - no excitement in taste and texture, even it was a slaw. Authentic Clay Mortar Papaya Salad - wish they didn't put ""authentic"" or ""mortar"" on this dish. This papaya salad was definitely NOT authentic nor mortared, no crushed or bruised like what I saw the ladies on a street of Thailand. Green papaya is always heavily crushing down in a mortar with a round headed stick and that natural juice with a heat from Thai chili creates amazingly addictive but nothing like that. This green papaya salad was just julienned and tasted like any other Thai place in the city, boring. Pad Thai and Green Curry (w/chicken)  - sweet (very) as any Thai place in the city, except the price.  Dark Night None of Asians at the table didn't care for it much as my Irish American hubby. He really enjoyed it. Ngam might be a great choice to take your friend or family to try Thai food for first time but be ready for inattentive service. At the end of the dinner, I asked my Thai friend ""....so what do you think?"" She whispered ""Everything was too sweet."""	2star
I came here for brunch and had the San Francisco omelette, with mushrooms, peppers, and goat cheese. My friend incidentally ordered the same. My omelette was good but my home fries were flavorless and soggy. My friend couldn't finish her meal because her omelette was undercooked. Staff was friendly and attentive, but overall, we were disappointed with the food.  Looking at the table next to us, the mussels looked amazing. I would like to give this place another chance. I hope to be back for mussels and a wine flight.	2star
Solid takeout.  For me, the menu standout would have to be the Pork Zha Jiang noodles. Medium spice should be enough for most people, but if you are sensitive to spicy food definitely let them know. Their pork and lamb burgers are meh. You could get better pork burgers just up the street from the carts by Columbia.	3star
I've been waiting to try this place out for a while as it always seemed like a cool spot. The decor is really nice, and it has always seemed busy in the evenings. I was pleased to know they have a happy hour from 4-7. Prosecco, a white and red, and a rosemary-infused G&T are on the list. None of the other cocktails. Sadly, when we arrived and came to the bar everyone who worked there was ice cold. The bar wasn't anywhere near slammed but NOBODY greeted us out of the 3 people milling about behind the bar (some making drinks, but come on, it's not a stretch to multitask if a greeting counts as effort). We waited a few minutes, checked out the menu, I was already growing impatient due to the cold atmosphere. Then another bartender came by and asked if we were being helped by the bartender who had her back completely to us. Nope. We were really just there to kill time, so a couple rounds of prosecco and an order of the shrimp sliders (with fries) was all we ordered. I wasn't hungry but the shrimp sliders looked pretty good. My cousin enjoyed them. The fries were good as well. As a matter of fact all of the food I saw come out looked good. Pizza, Calamari, Sliders, Salmon. I would love to come back and try the food but pray that it's a more welcoming environment.	3star
The Highwater is a nice place.  It's got a Honolulu meets Toronto vibe about it, if that makes sense. Service was friendly and efficient.   The decor is fun and very Hawaiian/tropical. The food was all decent to good.  I tried the baby bok choy, the karaage, the poké, the taro fries, and the grilled shrimp.  The best items were the baby bok choy and the karaage by far- delicious!  I also had a Skittles cocktail which had Skittles at the bottom.  One was fun, two was a bit too much sugar... The only dish I wasn't crazy about, and neither was my wife, was the poké, which was too sweet with ginger and pineapple.   Recommended overall!	4star
Kinda feel this place is all hype. Hidden behind the ramen bar in Chelsea Market, it's kinda cool to walk into this hidden area where there's actual seating to eat your tacos unlike Los Tacos No. 1.  I ordered a fish taco and a spicy shrimp taco and they were both good, but not the best I've had. In my opinion, it doesn't come close to Los Tacos No. 1's steak tacos. I'd still come back, though.  Also--it's convenient that they cook your order after you order from the cashier, as opposed to having to take your ticket through a bustling crowd at Los Tacos No. 1.	3star
This place was delicious. Im from san francisco and i know good korean food bit this place took the cake. The way the grill works is used by a candle, and you get to grill your wagyu beef slow grilled. While cooking it in fat not oils or butter. Omg this place is great. Thank you guys	5star
If you want your waiter to surprise you with their preference of food, and have zero regards as to what you request, go for this place. Will never come here again that's for sure!!	1star
"A long long long wait till we got seated. Because of its location it's really popular. The spicy ramen was okay - not impressive. I don't like their Peking duck appetizer - it was not even close to the real Peking duck style not sure why it would be called that way, not did I like the flavor of it. The servers were pretty slow and showed us an ""upset"" face after she strongly encouraged us to order several appetizers but we told her we only wanted to one."	3star
"""In our lives, change is unavoidable, loss is unavoidable. In the adaptability and ease with which we experience change lies our happiness and freedom."" - Buddha  Our schedule didn't allow for us to check out some of the Speakeasy and Craft Cocktail bars that are on my NYC list. As such, I was a little reluctant to go to Tanner Smiths as a fall-back option. We experienced a couple amazing drinks!...near perfect cocktails. Admittedly, the ambiance was not overly impressive, but venturing down to the basement portion of TS, we found a suitable space. My love and I enjoyed the Big Frenchy and a Razor Riley. These were alcohol forward drinks that were made with care. We did not try any of the food, and from what I saw I would guess that the food would be suitable if you needed something to eat while you were drinking, but it also didn't seem like a place I would seek-out for food."	4star
Not what it used to be. Tuesday HH suggestions used to always have Yuca in constant rotation - not anymore. The specials (1/2 tapas and $6 mojitos) are still intact but the mojitos are ridiculously watered down now.  The shorter bartender from Astoria (previously spent many of nights chatting with) has allowed the stress of the job to eat him up.  So bitter...borderline nasty.  I repeatedly asked for my margaritas straight up and he continued to serve them on the rocks.  Finally had to put some base in my voice for him to get right.  Ridiculous.   Hostess seats patrons in unbussed, dirty sections before returning to her post to text.  WTF?! Food is still on point but the drinks and service now suck. Won't be back.	2star
I'd love to tell you about the delicious Italian cuisine and amazing service, but I've never eaten here. I ordered takeout at 8pm on Friday, October 27th and it never arrived. I paid for the food, and I'm sure it's amazing, but I wouldn't know. I suggest you dine in.	1star
Would have loved to be able to try Jacobs pickles however we never got the chance to. We put our names in around 830 pm on a Friday night, and obviously busy time. They told us the wait would be 20-30 minutes. Sure no problem considering how busy it was. 30 minutes passed so we went to check to see how long the wait would be. They said less than 10 minutes. We left at 930 and we still had never received a text notifying us our table was ready.	1star
The unassuming storefront of the restaurant doesn't prepare for the large dinning area. Great ambiance with beautifully done lighting and a gorgeous skylight. We came for a Friday night dinner and had a 10pm  reservation. Unfortunately, we did not get seated until almost 11pm! Now I do have to say that the hostess was very apologetic and that the manager did feed my girlfriend and I free champagne the entire time we waited but we were still a bit ticked off (and therefore the 4 stars). Once seated, our waiter was very attentive and each thing we ordered came very quickly. We ordered off the restaurant week menu and since neither of us is big on desserts, we asked if we can trade in one of the desserts for a primi. Not only did we get our request granted but we also got a second dessert, and some chocolates and truffles for the table.  But first things first! The yellow tail was fresh and yummy, and the straccitella was perfectly rustic and comforting. It was the polenta that stole the primi show for me. Creamy goodness topped with amazingly flavorful mushrooms, I could eat it every day!  We also got the branzino which was flaky and moist on the inside with a crispy skin- perfection! The chicken was also good although not my favorite plate. For dessert we had the panacotta which was creamy but not too heavy and brightened by the beautiful acidity of the guava soup. The Nutella mousse was everything you'd expect it to be- rich and decadent!	4star
"I keep giving Tartinery chances and I keep being continually disappointed. Today my $17 flavorless Quinoa Bowl contained about two cups of quinoa, one leaf of kale, one stem of broccoli rabe, two slices of avocado and a ""poached egg"" that I watched them microwave. Not to mention it took about ten minutes for them to prepare.  With all the other fresh, delicious and quick food options available at Hudson Eats, I'm still kicking myself for wasting so many visits to Brookfield Place on an overpriced, less-than-mediocre fake French meal at Tartinery.  Two words: Never again."	2star
Great Spanish fusion food. I split the calamari frito, vaca Frita al caballo and salmon with two other people and it was more than enough. Everything was delicious - even the bread basket, which comes with small sweet rolls and some sort of tasty bean paste. Decent service.	4star
Soy milk was good (it's sweetened). Xiao long bao was good. Came out fresh and hot (they won't taste good if they have been sitting for a while). Sheng jian bao had too much bread compared to the amount of meat inside (e.g., meat to bread ratio too low). Overall pretty authentic but it's weird they also mention they have northern dishes right under the store sign which makes me question the authenticity.	4star
Really unfortunate experience. Wanted to try local Italian but was disappointed. The fact there were only two parties in the restaurant area and a smattering of people at the bar on a Friday night should have tipped me off. Food lacked flavor. The mozzarella in the caprese didn't have flavor. The bolognese with the gnocchi was weak. The bread was good though, and the Chianti not bad. Apparently cold water costs you money.  Wait staff was very attentive when I was ordering things but when I was done and said I didn't want dessert, it took them 20 minutes to bring me the check. Only one other party there at this point. The waiter just stood there stupidly on the floor while I had no dishes and empty glasses in front of me. Finally I put my credit card on the table and he decided to wander over, then he just left the check on the table even though my card was right there, then came back later. I couldn't wait to leave this place.	1star
Came here to celebrate our anniversary, and enjoyed a special, fun, and delicious meal.  The staff is friendly in a pleasantly understated way.  We sat at the bar, so we were able to really take our time making our way through some top-notch cocktails, grilled radishes and feta, and then the rabbit for two. So, this rabbit for two is a very, very good thing.  It's rabbit three ways, plus an outrageous array of side dishes that includes a green salad with fennel and mint, hummus with whole chickpeas and gorgeous olive oil, pickled vegetables, a yogurt dip, some dipping sauces, and flaky bread.  Good lord this is a fantastic dish, and it could easily serve three. I'm not sure what the portion size complaints are about in some of the reviews below.  We'll be back to sample more of the menu, but from what we had and what we saw going by, the portions looked perfectly ample.  As mentioned, the rabbit is ridiculously generous.  The ambiance is very brooklyn industrial chic, so maybe folks are expecting a casual couple small dishes to constitute a meal.  Not so, this place is elegant, and seems best enjoyed by splurging, ordering a bunch of stuff, and trying everything.	5star
Second time here and had the same problem, the beef bowl is border line inedible - way too much chewy fat (75%+). To top it off the customer service was rude. Thought I would give them a second chance but they failed. Would not recommend.	1star
I've been here for brunch a couple of times (whoo free sangria!), but recently went in for a 3-course Groupon dinner with my boyfriend.  If you check in on Yelp you can redeem a free glass of sangria - they have about 8 kinds to choose from (half red / half white). My favorite type of sangria is the Punta Cana, which is super tropical and fruity (peach / pineapple / orange).  I tried a couple sips of the Samba, which is also recommendable (acai liquor / brandy / blueberries).  Appetizers:  They bring out slightly sweet bread balls with a black bean spread, which are delicious and a great way to kick off the meal.   Pulpo a la Plancha (octopus):  great texture and flavor, enjoyed the chorizo crumbles and the bean/garlic puree. Because it's octopus, it's not a huge portion.  Dulce (sweet corn empanada with chevre and tomatoes): Awesome flavor, and a liberal amount of cheese, always a good thing.   Main Courses:   Lubina (sea bass):  Comes out with the tail on for presentation, but you don't have to do any work (the bones have been removed).  Served on a bed of spinach, bell peppers, onions, potatoes (it says fingerling potatoes but they seemed to be full-sized and cut thinly), and fennel.  Really good fish flavor, and everything complemented the meat well.  Red Snapper:  my boyfriend ordered this and semi enjoyed it.  Served on a bed of quinoa, it has a rather fruity / tropical flavor, and the fish itself absorbed a lot of lemon flavor (too much in his opinion).  It came with a couple of shrimp, which I don't think he was expecting (may have been his fault in reading the menu).  Vaca Frita: I've had this for brunch before and it's great: skirt steak, egg, avocado, and spicy rice. Yummy, filing, and pairs well with the booze.   Desserts:  Domino: The chocolate cake is ok but that Dulce de Leche ice cream - fabulous!! Ice Cream Sampler: vanilla / chocolate / coffee.  The coffee ice cream is the strongest I've ever had, in a good way. Super hearty kick of espresso in there. The vanilla ice cream here goes well with the chocolate cake from the Domino.  This place can get pretty crazy for brunch, but didn't seem that crowded around dinner time (8:00 pm).  That being said, it took a while before we were presented with the opportunity to order (20+ minutes).	4star
"I had high hopes for this place given its wonderful decor. But, it fell extremely short. The best two things at this Irish pub were a pumpkin shandy and chips/guac...that is telling. It is very crowded and loud. The tables are more suited for a bar that does not serve food. We had a variety of menu options around the table and none were good. I had the chicken pot pie and it was a joke. The flavor was missing and it was served in what a ""cup"" of soup is brought in at most restaurants. For the price, i was absolutely shocked. The servers were attentive, and I would only go back for drinks."	2star
When Fette Sau isn't busy (Mon-Wed & Thurs-Sun before 7 PM) it's worth a visit.  You walk in, queue up to order your food at the counter.  Meat is ordered by the pound and you get two slices of bread with each order.   As your food is prepared you pay, and have enough time to get yourself a half gallon, or gallon of beer if that's your thing. If whiskeys more your liking they have a very healthy collection. The decour is	4star
This is probably my favorite Thai place in hells kitchen. Expect some wait time 30 min or so. Must try sticky rice.	4star
I so wanted to love this place and was so excited when my friends organized a group dinner. Unfortunately, the best part was the decor and not the food. The food was just okay, I had the Fried Yardbird, it was good, but not OMG amazing. My friends all had the same assessment with their orders. I plan to give it another try soon, so hopefully that was an off night.  In addition, they accidentally charged me $260 for 3 cocktails. I knew before I even received the bill because my bank notified me via text right when they processed the charge. The waiter was confused and said that was my bill, and I nicely stressed I ONLY ordered 3 cocktails, how is the bill $260 (pre-tip). He realized his error and corrected.	3star
Came here on a weeknight after making a reservation and our waitress was definitely tired. She was pretty lethargic and I kinda felt bad lolol As for the food, it's upscale bo ssam. Bo ssam is a classic Korean dish where we take lettuce/leaves to wrap meat with rice and sauces, hence the word ssäm which means to wrap or enclose!  It's a great summertime dish and something families do outdoors to grill and eat together. We got the: - Broadbent Ham ($12): Pretty salty but it was okay with the bread. - Fried Duck Dumplings ($16): A little salty, but nice crunch and flavor overall. - Grilled Flatiron Ssäm ($59): Tender and juicy with really nice flavor  I really wanted kimchi, but I couldn't justify paying $7 for a tiny dish of it lol The main star was obviously the flatiron ssam which was great, but I think if I came here with a larger group and got the dinner Prix-fixe, it would have been more worth it!	3star
Stopped by for an early dinner with a friend a couple weeks ago after meaning to visit for months. Even received a recommendation from a random hairstylist who used to live in Brooklyn while on a trip a few weeks ago. So, we went in with high hopes.  The ambiance is nice, so we were excited that the meal would match the decor. WRONG  Everything we received, aside from the chicken and waffle pops, was cold. Even the Mexican Street corn was awful! Cold and rubbery. I was so disgusted I didn't even know where to begin and we were both too exhausted to endure the hassle of calling a manager over and waiting for recooked food. So, we trashed the remaining food and called the manager over on the way out the door to let him know about the poor experience.  My time is very precious and so is my cash. So, a restaurant only has ONE chance to get it right with me. When my friend and I went to this establishment, it wasn't even that busy. So, the fact that we received cold, thoughtless food during a lull does not bode well for what we might receive if it's really busy. Customer service is SO important and each dish should be prepared with that in mind. Especially in the highly volatile restaurant business. I won't be going here again. I don't care if Oprah scooped me up in a limo to go grab a bite.	2star
There aren't too many sit-down restaurants in the area, but Atrium is definitely an adequate one. They were having some problems with their gas line the day I went, so their menu was limited to mostly sandwiches, salads, and soups. How they were able to have hot food despite no gas is a mystery I don't care to unravel. Like I said, Atrium is relatively upmarket (at least in price), so it's best for business lunches. The place itself is big (there's an upstairs for events), but when everyone in the neighborhood is coming for lunch, your best bet is to be a small-ish group and sit at the bar (or the communal table by the front). The Cuban I had was good. It's not something I would personally pay for (had it expensed) just because I don't believe in $16 sandwiches. But it was fine enough. Service was nothing to complain about.	3star
Food arrived completely cold twice. One of the employees said I will be refunded but never was. Will never order again from this place	1star
1 star because service was HORRIBLE !!! Waited 11 minutes just to have my order taken... then 40mins later food comes out... guess what? She brings me the wrong dish & has the nerve to tell me she didn't hear me order my French toast. ( meanwhile wrote it down & pointed at it ) wtf???? .... At this point I'm extremely frustrated & hungry as hell finna swing on someone... but ok. I get my French toast 3 minutes later. 0 stars shit was soaked in eggs , super soggy & 5.00 for a little ass plate of eggs. This place is a JOKE. My waitress was whack. First & last time EVER. No tip or anything....	1star
So recently, a Mama friend asked me if I wanted to go on a Malaysian food adventure with our respective families. Well, heck, yeah.  'Cause I'll say 'yes' to pretty much any request that involves the words 'Asian' and 'Food.'  And c'mon, don't get me on technicalities.  'Aysian' is close enough.   Anyway, we were in a big group, which for me, tends to mean I am less focused on the food, but will try to at least remember the standout dishes we ordered.  For better or worse:  A big winner at our table was the tender Beef Rendang, essentially a stew with a lovely, rich curry gravy.  Fried Squid and Fried Tofu Satay were also hits.  Everyone, except yours truly loved the Roti Canai; I thought it was too thin and dry.  Crispy Garlic Chicken was well, crispy, but I think Congee Village delivers better in terms of garlic flavor.  And oh yeah, unless you like fishy tasting shrimp-infused bean sprouts wrapped in a soggy, warm steamed pancake you should probably steer clear of the Poh Piah.  We also got some sort of forgettable Noodle dish and a Sizzling Beef Platter that didn't make much of an impact.  Roti Telur, filled with egg, was just okay too, and kind of bland.  In fact, I think the menu describes at least some of the dishes that we ordered as being 'hot & spicy,' and we encountered none of that. And I wanted to!  Fwiw, the kid ordered a Bubble Tea and when Mama asked if they could make it less sweet, server said it was pre-made.  Needless to say, it was too sweet and on top of that, the boba were mushy.  Bubble Tea connoisseurs steer clear. On a Saturday night, this place was PACKED. This made the efficient, attentive service we encountered all the more impressive.  Food overall was more like 3 stars, but I loved the energy of this place.  Plus it's strategically located near tons of post-dinner Ice Cream spots, including Ferrara, right next door.  Though we wound up at Taiyaki for Japanese Soft Serve in a warm, waffle-like fish-shaped cone.  We also spotted a minor-ish celebrity.  Yo, Maggie Gyllenhaal, say 'hey' to your bro, Jake from me.   Ultimately, I'd definitely come back, especially for a big group dinner.  I'd just order a bit differently next time. ps  They take reservations for parties of 9 or more. double ps  Like everyone says, CASH ONLY.	4star
Came here this past Saturday around 2pm after an early days work with some friends. The place was really empty at this time, but that was great for us. The bartender was exceptionally nice and recommended some really great tasting brews. We ordered food, I had the clam roll which was delicious with some tasty fries, my friends seemed to enjoy there veggie something sandwich and the cheeseburger. The decor was really interesting and we went out back to their patio and checked out the coy fish ponds they have back there. Really cool, will really be great back there when it gets a little warmer out. The prices as every other review mentioned are really reasonable. I will definitely make this a new regular place to come to with friends. Check it out. Update: I had to drop a star off the original 5 I gave them. I had the oyster fry thats on their brunch menu that the cashier recommended, and it was not good at all. Very fishy tasting. The fish taco I ordered was almost tasteless. Luckily the burger and fries were delicious as usual. I wish I would have went with my gut and ordered that delicious clam roll I always get. I still have mad love for the bar but the food we had this time around was disappointing.	4star
Prefacing this with the fact that I have a pizza addiction. Really really good pizza here. The sauce is delicious. The cheese is super fresh. My girlfriend and I got a pepperoni with basil and it was awesome. Best pizza we had (out of about 4 spots) during our trip to NY. Mozzarella sticks were phenomenal and we had a spring mix salad with like a lemon vinaigrette that awesome. Service time was right on par with how packed it was. However, sitting at the bar may have reduced the wait time on food.  Props to the wait staff; they were busting their asses! Prices are pretty fair for an NYC restaurant. Definitely not getting overcharged here. I'll be back when on my next NYC trip!	4star
Thursday Kitchen is everything I anticipated it to be. My boyfriend and I came here one Friday night around 6pm. It was quite busy but it seemed like the line was short. Boy, were we wrong. Turns out, they have an electronic waiting system that sends a text message when the table is ready (brilliant, really, I dont know why other restaurants in the NYC area haven't done so). The wait was 1hr and 20mins long. That scared a lot of prospective customers away but not us! We were adamant on dining here so we put our names down and decided to hang around the area. We returned 40 minutes later and after a few minutes of waiting around we were seated. 45 mins wait was not bad - seemed like many people dropped out of the wait after a while.  My boyfriend and I could barely decide what we want. There were so many options. All looked delicious, but we settled on the following: Pork tacos Kale salad  Truffle mac and cheese Beef Kimchi Paella Everything was perfection. In highly recommend everything but the steak was perfection!! The bill came to about $55 which, for the amount and quality of our meal, and the fact that we finished absolutely stuffed and had to pack the last dish (paella) to go, it was an amazing experience and price. I highly recommend this place and don't be detered by the long wait - it is absolutely worth it!!!	5star
When I think of yakitori, I think of delicious chicken, on skewers, seasoned to perfection. I want to smell the faint scent of smoke when I walk into a yakitori restaurant and I want to leave even more in love with chicken than when I walked into the restaurant. I want to be transcended to the least of the best of yakitori conclaves in Osaka. When I realized I was in the midst of Hell's Kitchen on my last night in NYC after a canceled flight, I had to find somewhere to get good food. Yakitori Totto came up. I saw the closing time, on a Sunday, was 11pm. It was 10:15. I practically ran out of my hotel, down the street to beat the clock, mouth excited, emotions high because I'm about to become reacquainted with yakitori. The space: identical to what you would find in Japan itself. A bar situated around the grill. The grill masters clearly overheated from being over the flame. You have the separate seating along the back wall with a clear walk way. I'm not sure why this is so common in yakitori places, but it is and immediately, I'm transported back to Osaka. The Food: general pricing was 3.00 per skewer. This is pretty expensive. I will chock it up to being a NYC location drawback. I ordered the kawa $3 (skin) hatsu $3 (heart) lamb chop $7.5 and a bowl of udon in chicken broth $13. Everything was pretty delicious. I did find that some things lacked flavor that I'm accustomed to when it comes to yakitori. There should be a natural flavor from the chicken itself and typically something that just sets it apart, I have to admit I was on the hunt for that after my first skewer. When I received my bowl of udon, I was taken aback a bit. Udon are thick noodles, what I received looked more like ramen. When I inquired with the waitress, she said that's all they had. So, that was a disappointment, but they were delicious. My view of this place comes from someone who is extremely intimate with Japan and the food scene there. If you want to try yakitori, I think this place is a good idea. However, on my next visit to NYC, I'd continue to search for the perfect yakitori this side of the world.	3star
I've always loved OBAO - whether it's take out, delivery or eat-in. They never failed me. Their service gets hectic during lunch hour just like every other restaurant but they could be a bit more attentive.  I always get their PHO. I love the broth. How do you beat their lunch special for $9?? Comes with two fried dumplings too or others if you choose. I've eaten lunch at this location several times and ordered seamless for their east side location.	4star
Brunch on our NYC getaway was an easy choice of Jane. Known for their amazing french toast, for some odd reason, I was craving something savory - which is completely weird since I have an extra special affinity for the sweet stuff.  The Mr always chooses savory, so we were out of luck unless we decided to indulge in the frenchie for dessert Starting out with a nice bread basket of cranberry walnut bread & whipped butter, we were off to the races I chose the Waffle Ranchero & it was amazing - there was about an entire avocado sliced on that thing & paired w/ corn waffle, black beans, cheddar, & over easy eggs - yum! The Mr chose the Roasted Tomato Benedict & was likewise bowled over by the intense tomato flavor paired w/ charred asparagus, buttermilk biscuits, poached eggs, basil pesto, local mixed greens.....it was way too smokey for me but perfection for him House coffee to wash it all down & it was strong, not bitter & a nice house drip By the time we'd finished our meals, there was simply zero room for dessert or our planned french toast or anything else - we did cry a little but relegated ourselves to the fact we'd just need to come back asap to remedy this	5star
Disappointed me very much!!!!!!! Pork chop is too dry, too long time to fried!!!!!! Three cup chicken no taste, did they try to save the sauce?! And the Garlic white Meat.. what the hell is this?! I can smell the stink!!!! I am much sure my husband's cooking skill is higher than the cook here!!!! Not recommend!!! Not recommend!!! Not recommend!!!	1star
A while back I ate here with a friend and got the special for the pork face (I think?). Imagine a sucking pig roasted but just the face. It was divine with a side of veggies and sauce to wrap the pork into little transparent wrappers. I hope tasting collective will feature them again :).	5star
"Finally Open and a great Ridgewood addition to the neighborhood with the decor being warmly lit and showcasing a clean minimalist design with Dark Blond wood communal table seating, a few just for two table seating arrangements and outfitted with a marble bar countertop, l'm impressed with the decor and the very warm and personable bartenders thus far. Both the decor with its soft, warm lighting and the bartenders do a nice job making you feel very comfortable and welcomed stepping through CC's doors. I like that the Bartenders and one in particular named (Ceasar) hope I got his name right, cared enough to ask you your taste preferences so they can recommend Craft selections better suited to your taste buds, offer you a few samples so you can decide and is open to feedback / suggestions. Craft Beer On Tap... Brooklyn Sour - I would have never thought I would come to appreciate a sour beer until I tried this; a first for me as I'm not normally a Brew drinker but more of a Tequila lover suffice it to say the Brooklyn Sour is pretty dang good, a nice sour, mildly tart, with notes of green apples, lime and ginger very refreshing... my top favorite. Raspberry Soiree - Really I don't care for this fruit but once again this well crafted Ithaca beer turned out to be quite unique and refreshing in taste with a medium balance between tart and sweet, my 2nd favorite. Southern Tier Creme Brûlée Imperial Stout - Jesus Christ thank goodness I didn't choose this beer for myself but my peoples did, I took a taste of it and was all to happy to pass this back to them. If you love Stouts do try this, its Robust, Dark, Bold, Rich and heavy with definitive notes of Chocolate and Creme Brulee for sure and quite strong... LOL, I swear knocked my peoples socks off damn near. Good Stout just not for my tastebuds. Cold Case Porter's... I only tried two thus far and I like both but... Sweet Baby Jesus - Praise - delicious notes of Dark Chocolate & Peanut Butter with a medium bold taste bordeline dark but not so dark that you can't appreciate the craftmanship that went into this brew, very nice. I need a 6 Pack of this to keep around. Dirty Little Freak - is as the name suggests a bit dirty and a blend of warm, roasted malt, coconut, caramel, and chocolate flavors, I wouldn't say it stands out in terms of flavor or anything it's just ok.  They have many others I have yet to try in the cold case and nice to know; if you pick out a case of 6 all the same or mixed you get 10% off, so keep that in mind. The Food... Ridgewood BLT with Maple Bacon comes with Culture Fries /Garlic Aioli Dip or potato chips, my peoples chose the Culture Fries, I didn't get a chance to taste this sandwich because I think the stout made my peoples hungry, by the  time I looked the whole Maple Bacon sandwich was devoured all I saw was my people licking their lips trying to savor the remains of what hung around... If you don't have an aversion to pork, you know to go get this, clearly this is a solid choice as confirmed with my peoples. Slider Sampler... The Burger Meat is High Quality, thick and juicy! Huevo en Fuego Slider - The star of the 3, comes with a small Quail sunny side up egg, three different types of Hot peppers with one of them being a nice warm, fat, juicy, spicy Jalapeno. Defintely my top favorite! Hits the mark with me. Maple Bacon Cheeseburger - Porky the Pig never fails to liven up a great little cheeseburger with the added touch of the maple it kind of hits a umami on your tastebuds. Delish! Black Truffle Burger - I didn't care for this but if you like Black truffle cheeseburgers do try this, you will get that truffle flavor to satisfy your tastebuds with this burger for sure.  Culture Fries w/ Garlic Aioli Dip - Yum, Fresh cut on the premises fries, seasoned well with the perfect CC blend and comes with Garlic Aioli Dip to slather those hot babies in, can't go wrong with this ever. "" The only thing I would say of which I did mention to them, is to add more garlic to the dip, I could barely taste it and I love my garlic. Great place to sit, chill, enjoy a few well crafted brews, a bite to eat in a great atmosphere and great company. Ran into a lot of my neighborhood friends here was great seeing them too. Now if they could just play more upbeat background music it would be greatly appreciated, this isn't a coffee, cake or tea Cafe so yeah please change the music. Well Crafted..."	5star
I've been to multiple Luke's locations in the city, this Dumbo location has the worst lobster rolls. Bread was stale, lobster meat was not fresh, it's a disgrace to be called Luck's lobster when you serve people not completely defrosted lobster meat that tasted like nasty dry chicken breast. It's a complete tourist trap.	2star
I sat next to my date (not across from each other) in one of those tables right next to the Xmas tree.  Our view was the Xmas tree. Their servers move around hundred miles an hour and to see all that in front of me while dining was pretty chaotic. Next time I will request another table. It was too much for me.  It's a loud, fast moving restaurant. Super packed and busy all the time.  But their food is on point and you just can't get enough of it. It is SO good.  Wish I had another belly to fit it all in. The host was excellent. He greeted us right away and made us feel welcome.	5star
Well let's see, our dear friend puked on the subway platform and my wife and I are still up with diarrhea. This place needs to be shutdown!	1star
Wish I could give less than one start. First of all, don't open a restaurant if you don't like people. The Brooklyn jaded rude pretentious staff thing is getting old. And the pizza is incredibly overrated.	1star
"This review is probably biased because iLove pizza- but good pizza lol Found this place on yelp as being one of the best pizza places. It's a bit of a mind maze because you place your order in one line, wait for it another, then seating is outside of the building. I ordered the ""White Guy"" which was really good. My only gripe with this place is having to go outside to another spot that's associated with Robertas to eat it. It was a bit nippy outside so you have to be mindful about keeping your food covered so it doesn't get cold. I'm not sure if the goal is to hurry up, eat, and go but you can't really enjoy the food especially if it's a bit cold."	4star
"I was interested in Lombardi's history as this was claimed to be the first place pizza was first introduced in 1905. When you walk in you're met with a bar, and tons of pictures on the walls lol. It's rather rambunctious in the front, and so it was nice to be taken to the back (think of a wide hallway of tables on either side). We got the Original Margherita small pizza (14"", six slices). It had fresh mozzarella, tomato sauce, and basil. The waiter asked us if we wanted water, when we said yes, he asked us what kind. I replied with, ""Water...?"" And he said, ""I need to know if you want tap, bottled, or sparkling."" Tap is fantastic in New York, so we asked for tap. I was disappointed in the pizza. It was perfectly cooked, the crust had a nice bite to it, but I thought the crust from Pizza Cafe was much tastier and had more flavor. Also, the pizza didn't look appetizing. There were these shriveled bits of basil on top, and there were only about five pieces lol, which on a 14"" pizza looked awkward. I didn't eat the crust and I left a little disappointed."	2star
We arrived and didn't really know what to expect other than they had noodles and that it was going to be relatively good considering it had 4*s on yelp. We didn't realise it was going to be so fancy and intimate which is my bad, cause I should have read the other reviews more closely, we definitely wouldn't have taken our fussy 6 month old . The lady who showed us to the table was clearly not impressed with the whole baby thing and luckily she put us in a corner. I wanted to leave as soon as I had arrived but the food arriving at the other tables looked too good, so we stayed.  When we ordered I clearly said I wanted the duck noodles, my husband went for several of the skewers. Unfortunately the waiter misheard my order and I ended up with just plain broth and noodles which, whilst very tasty, it didn't satisfy my meat craving and I didn't want to have to wait any longer for another lot to be made. Overall the food was great but service was pretty snooty.	3star
went there for brunch to celebrate a birthday. Decor is great and sets a good mood. drinks were great. Service was slow but place was packed. Food overall is OK. fried chicken was real good the beignet slider are definitely worth a try. Jambalaya, not even close. Food could be closer to NOLA standards. I would try again but have lower expectations.	3star
"The Williamsburg location is better than the original E Village one (I can't believe I said that).  The layout is modern, clean and refined. They clearly did away with all Moroccan decor and leaned toward the style of their emigrants... France. The backyard is the highlight - windowed walls with greenery and heaters. It's a unique and beautiful space.  One thing though before I discuss the food (because I got triggered reading many other reviews) It's Moroccan *fusion* food - not ""middle eastern"" and **certainly** not down home ""authentic"". Moroccan food is spicier than other cuisines from the ""Middle East"". Morocco is in Africa remember.  Does one go around wanting ""European food""? Or instead- Italian food, Greek food, French food, etc...? Ok so now that we we have unpacked Global North hegemony as it relates to food - onto the food.  It was TASTY!  The mixed platter was divine and beautiful to look at (I especially loved the eggplant). But the best part was the spicy sauce (harrissa?) that was served on the side. I had to ask for more - because it just took each flavor up a notch.  I also enjoyed my grilled calamari special. It was light - *definitely* a fusion item, nonetheless still tasty.  The key lime pie dessert was a fail - that's why I took off a star. The crust was lackluster and reminded me of a French tarte and the filling was way too creamy with very little tart lime taste. We were disappointed about that and wished that there were more Moroccan fusion desserts.  I'll be back though - and will load up on the savory so as to avoid the sweet."	4star
"WOW!!!  I'm visiting from California and originally from Arizona so when I saw this ""NYC"" taco place I thought ok I guess I'll suffer through a sub-par taco. The taste blew me away - better than anything I've had in the west (I hope no one I know from there reads this).  If you are anywhere near Times Square, run - do not walk - to Los Tacos!!!"	5star
This is a cute and cozy place in soho. The restaurant is quite small, and it gets really packed. The servers are really kind and courteous. The food is very healthy and fresh. They really know how to utilized every square inch of this place. I got the chicken prego, and it was perfection. The chicken was nice and tender, and the the sauce was just perfect. My husband got the chicken kabo, and it was good, but not great, because the chicken was rather dry. Or else, I would give this 5 stars.	4star
Way overpriced run of the mill Thai food, small portions.   We ordered the special crab and pomegranate salad.  Sitting at the bar, I watched them top it off with a 1/4 scoop of Talenti pomegranate ice cream-  for the price I was assuming home made... The salad was way less than what I feed my cat.  Pad Thai was served Luke warm, and curry was nothing special.  Bill was $70.	1star
First, I waited 45mins for the seafood pancake, yes this seafood pancake only have 2 dices of octopus, and a few of fake crab meats. The octopus is like chewing a rubber.Absolutely horrible !! Then I waited another 10 mins to for the noodle, I can smell the sourness before even trying it. Two bites and I'm done with it. I can't eat it any more . The kimchi fried rice is okay. Korean BBQ bugogi, shouldn't be bad right , guess what, it came out ster fried thin slices beef !!! I will never come to this place ever again. Not like I'm sitting at a corner , but no server come to our table. If u tried korean food at korean town at midtown . I totally don't recommend this place. If u never had korean. I guess u can try it . Wasted money and time on a Friday night !!!!	1star
Have been here for dinner a while ago and finally came for brunch last weekend. It was a rainy Sunday and on the early side (11:30ish) so thought there wouldn't be much of a wait. The wait was about 30-45 minutes which was fine since I wanted to be super hungry when we sat down and it worked! The bf and I ordered a few things to share with our plates, he had the short rib hash and i had the mushroom, spinach scramble - eggs were cooked perfectly fluffy and slightly under done. As sides we shared a cheddar waffle, bacon and hashbrowns, everything was delicious. I loved the waffle since the cheddar comes through in every bite and is crispy on the outside with a little chewiness. To top it off, we had a cinnamon bun which I wish was a bit warmer but was still great. Service was on point as well, attentive, quick and not overbearing.	4star
Went here last night for a friend's birthday. When we first arrived although we had reservations we still had to wait 30 minutes for a proper table. Because of the wait management did give us free cornbread so we were a bit relieved. The waiter took our drink orders and everyone received their drinks quickly except for me...  the waiter totally forgot about me... it would have been forgiven if she apologized but instead she caught an attitude when I told her I never received my drink.... at that point I wanted to walk out but we were there to celebrate a birthday.  Overall negatives - drinks were weak - food was average and bland (no one enjoyed their meal and we were a group of 10)  - service was terrible  Overall positives - cornbread was good.  Just a warning: if you come with a party of more than 7 they get an automatic 20% tip...... whether the service was great or not... SMH	1star
Overpriced, mediocre food. Maybe cheaper than nearby bars, but the quality is much lower. Fish tacos were pretty good, but not even those were super memorable. Also they kick you out of the backyard before 11 PM :( Not a terrible place, but nothing special. The drinks are fine, definitely don't eat here though.	2star
I was in NY the whole week for work, and I really wanted to pick some stuff up at Muji, so I decided to come here since it was nearby and close to Grand Central! Got seated immediately at the bar, and there were a few other groups when I went ~8pm, but it wasn't packed. My server came over promptly and asked me if there was anything I wanted to drink, and she was happy to give me some suggestions for what to get. The menu isn't very extensive - it's easy to pretty much see all their offerings on 1-2 pages, so I didn't have a hard time choosing what I wanted. I got a mint yuzu spritzer and the zuke maguro appetizer to start, and a normal size of the tonkotsu ramen (there's also a larger size) with some menma (bamboo shoots) added. The yuzu drink, despite it's simplicity and the fact that it's just basically flavored sprite, was very refreshing. Definitely a good kick of citrus and some light notes of mint. Since I was seated at the bar, I got to see one of the chefs make the appetizer right in front of me - tender chunks of soy marinated tuna paired with rough chops of tataki cucumber, and a bit of cilantro (ehh, I picked most of this out lol) and Japanese chili oil. It was light but very palatable, and a great dish to nibble on as I waited for my ramen. It's also very filling, despite it's appearance and light taste. My ramen was brought out pretty quickly; I'd gotten through maybe 1/3 of my appetizer? It came with an adorable sheet of toasted nori printed with the 'momosan' logo, a few slices of pork chashu, a soft-boiled egg, wood ear, and shredded greens. The chashu was classic melt-in-your-mouth good in texture, and the flavor was there. The soft-boiled egg was really well done, and definitely marinated (a lot of ramen places do plain soft-boiled eggs). Overall, I found the broth to be a little flat in flavor though - mostly seasoned with just salt and a bit on the oily side, rather than the creamy, pork flavor I prefer, but still good nonetheless. I took bites of my tuna in between bites of ramen, and was stuffed by the end.  It's a solid place (prices are fair, the food/portion size is good), and if I wasn't by myself, I would have loved to share some of the other appetizers that I've heard so many good things about. :)	4star
"This is a tough review for me to write, as I've had 2 totally amazing meals food-wise here.  The first time was pretty flawless.  Food is not just good, but different.  Flavors/combinations that even a well-dined, borough-traversing, adventurous NY-eater can say ""wow, I've never had this before."" Fava bean stew with potato skin chip scoops?  Yes.   First visit on an empty summer Sunday wine, food, service all good.  The second experience I came with my partner, my Mom and my wine-loving boss.  The food was just as delicious, but the service and other elements really brought everything down.  NY is full so much goodness, you must fire on all fronts to be a great restaurant. Our waiter was harried and making sure we knew it.  My friend asked about the wine list, specifically for a sommelier or anyone who knew more about the wine.  The waiter kept insisting that he could handle it and if he could go see a ""picture of the label"" he could help because he was a ""visual learner"" and would remember from the staff tastings they did.  Of course this resulted in a bad choice of wine, which we sent back.  Normally i would feel badly about that, but we were so clear we wanted to actually discuss the wine. They never let us forget this for the rest of the meal. We ordered a lot of food but the waiter said it seemed light, so we got another entree.  That entree failed to arrive until after the entire meal was completed and taken away.  We were so stuffed and had already over-ordered without that additional dish.  And I am talking about 4 big eaters here.  They insisted on bringing it anyway, so it just sat on the table and we paid the bill.  The last offense I cannot get over is the charging for bread with dips.  They sell labne at $5 as just a standalone bowl.  Then they ask you if you want bread, which is an extra $7.  How would one eat the dip without any bread?  Just call it $12 and put it on the menu.  It just felt so petty and tacky. For the price point of the food, they need to know more about wine and to up the selection.  It just doesn't jive to not offer quality beverage service to match the caliber of the food."	3star
The ONLY , reason they get one star is because they still have my number from a year ago. i have to say their food is WAYYY over priced.. and just not right. i understand.. you're in cool Greenpoint, and Have LOBSTER on a hot dog bun but GAWD DAMN.   20 buck for one roll and some refried french fries... wowza.. I aint even mad about the price of the food, if it were good.  I remember when they got my number i was at Mark Bar(5 stars, and i think they might own tahat too) and when it was delivered the soup was still cold and the roll was , well, cold and ewe,, yes like the llama, or is that an outstretch.. or WHATEVER.. i am so distracted by how wrong that roll and rest of the food was.. i ordered it tonight for a friend who was raving about the last time they SAT and ate, so we got a delivery despite my NO! . the Lobster was abundant on the .10 cent roll but RUBBRY   i could replace my .25 cent rubber ball for it and it would be just as NOT delicious .. bubble gum machine food is not worth 20 bucks. AH ROLL aka PLATE..  so disappointed and i really hate that people are eating here.. nothing against any one, and i am sure the idea is buttery claw dipping, effing DELISH ( as they say in GreenBurg.) but come on.  and the soup.. wow.. we ordered the Clam chowder soup (water) with dried out crunchy basil leaves and did i say water? cause i think they used water and butter, and some water.. with some celery and chunks,, oh, and water. ... and guys.. id rather pay less for better in Manhattan where things are always over priced and not so great.. KNOW WHAT I SAYIN! Sorry guys.. but you fail... i could order two lobsters and make some bakers and get some cambles and make a much better meal for less money.. 60 bucks for 2 soups and two rolls.. GFY.. maybe i was expecting a hand job... but NO HAPPY ENDING HERE just regret ... I'm still chewing on the lobster too.. who does that to something so delISHHHH	1star
We were in town for a wedding and I happened to stumble upon some reviews for this place. We went on a Saturday evening and we waited about 20 mins. The chicken was SO good. It was crispy, slightly salty, and juicy. I was so sad when it was done lol We would definitely return if we're in town again.	4star
Come here if you like Italian food and have a great big appetite. Be prepared to take some food home too!  I came here before seeing a show and read several reviews saying their portion size was large. However, I didn't realize their food was all family size! My date and I got an appetizer and one pasta dish, and that ended up being waayyyyyyy too much. I would say that one pasta dish contains a 3-4 person serving size. We got the mussels in the red sauce which was very good. They give you a basket of bread, on the house, which was perfect for all the  juices/ red sauce from the muscles. We also got the penne pasta with vodka sauce. It was good but we had a little more than half the dish left, but we were way too full to finish. I had their grapefruit margarita as well which was delightful. I would probably come back in a larger group but definitely not just for 2.	4star
Wordless.... I don't even bother to say anything, too hungry waiting here an hour for our appetizer comes out... Cocktails, tasteless.	2star
"DON'T HAVE GROUP EVENTS HERE.  I don't leave reviews, good or bad. But was inspired by the rudeness and intentional disruption to what would have been a very happy occasion, a good friend's bday get-together Sunday morning brunch. Would like to provide insight on ambience, food, etc. but unfortunately, the main hostess, Jennifer, was so rude and condescending, half the group didn't stay.  The group showed up at 10am (when they open for brunch on Sunday). We had a group of 14, 5 of us were 15 minutes late. The place was maybe 20% full downstairs and empty upstairs. Jennifer decided to intentionally seat the 9 in a room where no other seating was possible. When the extra 5 showed up, she insisted we get seated upstairs. When I asked her if it was possible to at least sit downstairs so we are in some sort of close proximity, she shut us down and got the hostess to take us up. She was both blunt and condescending in her tone (the only thing missing was her telling us to ""fuck-off"").  I asked the hostess why Jennifer was being a bitch to us, she apologized and said ""she's straight forward"". Not a top trait for someone working with customers. We get taken to a room which seated over 20 people. They could have easily seated the whole group there, plus another group.  At that point it dawned on me, she was rude, condescending and felt like she intentionally split the group up, for no reason at all.  We didn't want to stay, why would I pay for a service when up until this stage, was the worst service I had experience in my 3 years in NYC? I've also lived in Sydney, not once have I been ""greeted"" with this attitude like this. The other hostess seating us was very lovely, but damn, Jennifer.  I went down to speak to her, asked her why she was being rude to us from the moment we walked in and also asked if she had intentionally split the group up, which she actually said YES! Wow... so if you're a big group that wants to spend money, basically ""fuck off"". And I also got a fake apology of ""I'm sorry you feel that way"". I asked for her manager and she offered the business card. I asked if she could write her managers name on it, and was giving a smart-ass tone of ""I sure can"".  I then asked to speak to her manager, she told me she may be busy in the office, I asked her I still want to speak to her. She tried a couple times to convince me otherwise but I insisted. The manager came down, was very calm and did have the right attitude a manager should have.  I can guarantee the staff that work with her must get a load from her too, but surely she's on her best behavior when the manager shows up. The hostess seating us was apologetic and very sweet so I hope this saves these poor souls. Look, she may not be a morning person or might just enjoy a power trip when she thinks she can pull it off, but whatever happened today was completely uncalled for, broke up the bday party, and left me with a very sour taste in my mouth. Never coming back or spending a cent with this establishment.  Have a great Sunday"	1star
"Sometimes attitude is more important than food.  It's Saturday afternoon, we decide to order delivery and enjoy the calm of our home. We received our order by the kindest delivery guy and sadly, a biscuit (part of the order) is missing. In the middle of my partner's freak out (""the biscuit was half of the reason why we order from them""), I decide to make the call to see if we can have the biscuit sent. After quickly explaining the missing biscuit situation to the girl on the phone, she replied ""NO, it's not true, I packed that order!""  Um, I'm not lying about a missing biscuit (I explained). But again, defensive and rude, she made it clear she didn't believe me. At this point I had to just agree on a refund before things got worse.  If the person who answered the phone and packed my food is impolite and incapable of accepting a silly mistake, I'd rather pass on their food altogether. Experiencing rudeness and bad attitude makes everything taste bitter."	2star
With such good reviews we had high expectations. Unfortunately it started with an odd smell like sewer as soon as you walk in. Then the bread was simple old bread rolls. The steak was undercooked to my wife's request and had to be sent back for recook.  They advertised homemade pasta so I wanted to try their mushroom ravioli unfortunately it was undercooked and pretty hard. The only standout were the two nice servers. Next time we'll make the trip across to Manhattan for a proper steakhouse.	2star
- wait for 65 min - wrong table's order came to our table, and they realized after 10 min. We did not touch them because 2 dishes came for 3 of us. Those dishes  directly went to the neighborhood table. No no! we only picked some fries...  - they had 5 or 6 different cheese for the burger but they runout half of them. Wrong kind of cheese came when we get the burger. - they also forgot additional coke. My friend order it because the waiter asked him if he needed another one. - i smelled some dish detergent on tomato. Probably that was on the dish surface. I hope the detergent was organic too. Its very rare event that we experienced all different types of issues in one brunch. At least bill calculation was correct, and weather was very nice outside.	1star
"Tapas are decent, but nothing ""oh my god"" good.  Tres leche dessert was excellent.  Music was a bit loud for my taste, but I'm becoming an old fart."	3star
Okay, so maybe I'm just not a Francophile.  But I really wanted to like this place. I had high hopes coming here, but in the end, I just can't muster up the energy nor the enthusiasm to look on the bright side.  Almost all of the foods we had were mediocre and overpriced and WAY TOO SALTY. The sea scallop carpaccio?  It had an awful fishy smell and way too salty.  The baked portobello?  It was hard as a rock as well as a very potent salt bomb.  The croque monsieur was way too salty too.  The only thing that I could say was decent was the cajun chicken with the side of quinoa and ratatouille. Even the drinks weren't that good either.  Service was good though. I just can't.	2star
Great space, the backyard is amazing. Good selection of food and wine.	4star
This place may have me convinced that NY Pizza really is better than Chicago's take.  Terrific, from scratch sauce and awesome crust with super fresh ingredients...loved that I was able to add sun dried tomatoes as well. It's one of the better pizzas I've ever had.  Good service and a chill atmosphere as well.  This is a hidden gem down in the FiDi corner of Manhattan.  Highly recommended!	5star
I arrived here at 9:30 PM with my friend and was told that the wait would be only 5-10 minutes. More than 30 minutes later, they told us that they won't be seating anyone until 10:15. Since we waited there for so long already, we decided to stay. We finally were seated at 10:20 but then was told by our waiter that they won't be taking any orders for another 10 minutes. Finally, we order our food at 10:30. It took more than 20 minutes to get our 2 garlic bread sticks. At 11:00 our food finally comes. If we had known that we would be waiting for 1.5 hours at this place, we probably would not have eaten here. I would have appreciated better communication with what was happening, especially since we were told it would only be a 5-10 minute wait. The food was good, however, but I have eaten at better Italian restaurants. At least the waiter was nice to us.	3star
I never complain but this is the second time that I had a horrible  time 3 people didn't get there food they had no waitress with a smile they didn't want to work and tried to charge us for the food we did not get I can't believe they are still in business they need pep in there step horrible horrible	1star
Came here for lunch from the great reviews on yelp. I wasn't as impressed as everyone else seemed to be about the place. I will say that the atmosphere is very relaxing but we won't be rushing back for a $100 lunch for two just for the atmosphere. The calamari was delicious as an appetizer but once the entrees came, it was as if they used the same seasoning for the dishes and all the flavors from the fish almost fussed together. I thought the scallops were the best part of the Kyclades Special. We might go back to give this place another try but I'm not betting on it.	3star
We waited for over an hour in line to get a table for two. We could tell that this place was legendary from that experience alone. Loved the atmosphere inside - pizza chefs were making things right behind the counter and were easily observable. Very cool to watch! The pizza itself was fantastic, albeit pricey. But we weren't there to save money. We heard that Juliana's was the place to be, and it certainly was. It took a little longer for us to get our food than it did our neighbors, and we were offered a free dessert for that. The server and host were so kind!	4star
Ordered the platter with burnt ends and beef brisket, comes with corn bread and a side. Portion is a bit small, but you can always order another a la carte! You must get the burnt ends here, super tender and juicy! Beef brisket, meh, a hit or miss for me. I'm definitely returning to try the burger though, the table next to us had it and it looked really awesome.	4star
The service was good, and the place is decorated beautifully but the pasta was bad and the wine also.. I was disappointed..	2star
Great service. Delicious food. Nice outdoor seating with the other restaurants in the area.	5star
Good barbecue. For NYC barbecue you could call it great; it's definitely the best in town.  The brisket was a bit dry. Not too dry but even a little bit means a lot with brisket.  Everything else was excellent.	3star
I have tried this place several times. Primarily delivery only though. Maybe in person is better. Every delivery order is late by at least 1 hour, every time. And the pizza they deliver seems like they put the minimum amount of every topping. By the time I get it each time the food is cold.  I will no longer keep trying this place. Unfortunate.	2star
My fiancé lost her engagement ring here last night. She took it off in the bathroom to wash her hands and forgot it on the wooden record player next to the sink. By the time she realized it wasn't on her and went back to the bathroom it was gone. The staff was informed, the customers were questioned, but nobody had seen it. 911 was informed and a police report was filed. Unfortunately the location doesn't have security cameras so we don't have anything to rely on to track the ring down.  PLEASE if anyone has pocketed it or if it has been found we'd like our ring back. It isn't a cheap fashion piece. It's an ENGAGEMENT RING and it holds sentimental value. I hope you can understand. If found please send me a direct message. I will not press any charges. We just want our ring back.  Thank you.	2star
Drinks were okay but our waitress didn't bother providing customer service tonight. My party of 5 was seated in the back and was told to order at the bar. For a Sunday night, business was relatively slow. Not once did our waitress try to check up on us! As much as I wanted to love this place, I couldn't.	1star
Very busy and buzzy atmosphere. The food is just ok, with the appetizers being better than the entrees. The chicken liver mousse, pork chop, and beet salad were good. Don't get the octopus, duck, or Brussels sprouts. The escargot and whole fish were edible, but not much more can be said. And it's a wine bar, but just a touristy wine bar, not the kind that actually has interesting wines nor cares too much about wine. If you must come, get the meat and cheese plate, at least it will come with the crusty bread.	2star
Oh blue ribbon. What's happened to you? Once a NYC staple, now perhaps you've spread yourself thin across the city and have stopped paying attention to, oh, I don't know, the food?  We ordered foie gras, bone marrow as appetizers. The foie gras was fine, the same Hudson valley foie gras you can buy at Zabars or Citarella or Fairway. The bone marrow was gloppy and overly sweetened with jam.  My smoked trout salad made me want to cry, because it was just a sad, sad excuse of a salty wilted mess.  My friend's duck breast was dry and bland.  Oh, there was a hair on my bread plate. I asked the waiter for a new plate. Then I watched him take my plate to the back area, where he brushed the hair off with his hand, then brought it back.   I want to give this place 0 stars, but the manager walked by and noticed that we hardly touched any of our food. I give this place 2 stars for the manager's service - he comped most of our tab - thank you for paying attention to our sad, hungry faces.  Probably won't be back. Ever.	2star
Sunday brunch.. Yes it's noisy, but the food is delish!  Our party of 5 all tried different dishes, and all were amazing.	5star
3.5 to be exact. Good pizza, but not the best in NYC. The crust was very buttery, (especially the center slices) and the cheese was super stringy and gooey. It really remind me of a Chicago deep dish, but just less thick and in rectangular-form. Their old-fashion pie was enormous - definitely enough to feed 4 hungry people. I wish they were more reasonable with their portion/pricing as they didn't sell half sheets and charged extra if you wanted half/half of the red and white sauce ($3 additional for each). They do serve smaller thin crust circular pies that are more appropriate for smaller groups, but those didn't look as awesome as their old-fashion pies. For the pies, you can have it plain or add toppings (with prices ranging from $3 to $6 each). We got pepperoni and they definitely didn't skimp out on the amount of meat that was towered on top of the pie. I would definitely recommend up to 3 toppings max, as it would really overwhelm the pie (unless you do the half/half option).  Overall, Adrienne's Pizzabar is a great place for a big party. You will get a warm and delicious pie, but the flavors/toppings aren't anything extraordinary. I would not make a trip to FIDI just for the pizza, but definitely one of the best pizza spot in the area.	3star
"Salt overload!!! I ordered the Shack Stack burger and thought it looked really good. Key word is ""looked"" because the patties tasted like an ocean- filled with salt and who knows what else. Also, for $10 the burger was a bit on the small side.  However, I will give credit for the beef party's texture. It was crispy around the edges, yet not burnt all. Also, I went on a Tuesday afternoon and there was no line- a HUGE improvement over the lines I've seen at other Shake Shack locations!"	2star
We ordered chicken wings and momofuku ramen and they were bad.... if you like ramen and Japanese food, you can just skip this restaurant.	2star
I love Ramen!  I'm from Hawaii and we know good ramen!  The classic tonkotsu ramen is flavorful and the noodles were cooked well.  Also ordered the gyutan, tongue, bun special and it was very soft and delicious!! I love the ambience and the local ale they serve alongside the Japanese beer is a nice homage to NYC local brewery.  I really like that! Thanks for the great meal Ippudo!	4star
Went to Felice with co-workers last night!! First time there and it was a big hit. We had a large party so we were seated upstairs. The place was really cute... books, candles, wine bottles, dim lighting, good lounge music and everyone was really nice. Happy hour is only at the bar, boo :( We got seated right away though... Our waiter was nice and welcoming and took our orders right away. We got the calamari and crostone burrata to share-- delish! I got the goat cheese/beat salad (special) and that was amazinggggg. I am not a huge fan of beats, but these were fresh and tasty! Got the steak for dinner and it was the perfect medium and seasoned perfectly. I loved the little pieces of salt sprinkled on top. The charred broccolini was so good too, usually it's not that good (cold, tasteless etc), but these were crunchy and perfect side with the steak and potatoes. Dessert we shared the panna cotta and cheesecake, both were delicious! The waiter did go missing after the table was cleared so it took a while to get the dessert. There were two other large groups, but he came back and apologized. Overall it was a great dinner and everyone enjoyed. I picked the place (so a little pressure), but everyone was happy and said they had a nice time. Drinks were very good too-- I had the basil cocktail :) Thanks Felice!	4star
"My boyfriend and I went to north end grill for a few drinks. We were served by a woman who was very attentive and nice. However, she disappeared on our second drink and we were served by an extremely rude waiter. My boyfriend asked for a ginger ale and vodka. Upon receiving it, it was literally just ginger ale. We tried the drink numerous times and decided there was absolutely no alcohol in it. When we approached the waiter about it he was rude and condescending, telling us we were wrong and there was alcohol in it. My boyfriend and I let him know he would never send a drink back, he could taste it for himself, and it was truly just ginger ale. He was very rude and came back 5 minutes later with a shot of vodka saying ""just add this"". We were highly offended. When we asked for the Bill, No one came and we had to ask the hostess. We then went to look at the back room and a waiter stopped us ""asking us what we were doing"". We live in the area and will never go back due to the highly disrespectful and inexperienced staff...a disgusting experience."	1star
Went for lunch on a Saturday.  Unfortunately, many interesting items are available only at dinner.  That said, the food for the price was in line and the service was very good.	3star
I was so excited to visit another Dino bbq bc of my experience in Syracuse... sad to say this version of dinosaur bbq left much to be desired. The hostesses seemed confused and had little concept of there own seating chart. Once we were seated it was 10 mins before our waitress inquired about our drink order, which took 20 mins to get. After which we placed our order which arrived 30 mins later cold and drenched in sauce that should have been served on the side. The food itself was good but does not good a candle to the meals I've enjoyed in Syracuse. The Mac and cheese was dry and the ribs and chicken were dry and like I mentioned earlier cold. After we were ready for the check the waitress circled the tip suggestion on the bottom of the check as if we could appreciate or recognize quality service. I'm really disappointed in the quality of the food and the lack of service we received.	2star
My coworker organized a delivery order - we are in Fidi and there's a dearth of good Chinese down here.  - Black egg/pork congee - delicious, comes in a big tub. - Wonton Lo-Mien. I got it without soup but still got a tub of soup to go with. Both were perfect.  - Steam rice roll with sesame and hoisin sauce. Delicious - this is literally a roll with nothing inside.  My coworker also got fried fish skin which was surprisingly very good and goes perfectly with congee. I think delivery took a while around lunch, and our building is a pain to find so I felt bad for delivery guy. Works out well if we have a big order to tip more.	5star
"This place is nothing special. Nothing to write home about. Really not worth going to.  Gnocchi had no flavor, cauliflower was steamed from a bag (green giant style) then stuck under the broiler, mussels were overlooked and shrunk, the pork chop was described as a ""smoked shank""  - two different parts of the animal in one dish? So we asked the waitress to describe the dish to us and she said ""I really don't know what else to say about it."" How can you be a waitress and not know what's in a dish or how it's prepared? And how can you actually say that to a paying customer?! Then a manager came over to try and explain and he couldn't either. The pork chop came as a chop even though it was described as if it were a braised pork shank. Only eh and it was missing the ""roasted plums.""  There's better stuff around, skip it."	1star
More like 3.5 stars. Average tasting dumplings. The skin is a little too thick and the flavors are a little too bland for my liking. Nothing much to brag about about although they offer a variety of dumplings from chicken, vegetables to pork. Some dumplings are pan fried while others are served broiled.  I REALLY do like the sesame duck pancake. It's oily, heavy, and filing. Worth all the calories. Haha  BEWARE: this place can get packed easily but the line goes pretty fast. Bathrooms are disgusting but it's no surprise. @ Vanessa's Dumpling House, you totally get your money's worth!	3star
"I love lobster rolls but I hate paying $15+ for a scoop of lobster-studded mayo on a cold hot dog bun. So I breathed a sigh of hangry relief when I finally tried Luke's and saw the healthy heap of fresh lobster lightly coated with mayo on a thick, golden, buttery roll that resembles Texas toast more than hot dog bun. It's the best lobster roll I've tried in NY (2nd place goes to Ed's Lobster Bar, 3rd to Red Hook). The shrimp roll is pretty good too, and half the price of lobster. I wasn't a fan of the crab roll which I found tasteless, but I'm not a fan of crab in general. This location is tucked away, which I like, and the employees are nice.  Many of the low star reviews are gripes about the size of the rolls. Obviously it's not a Subway footlong but I think the saying ""it's not the size of the wave, it's the motion of the ocean"" applies here. The lobster and the bread are both so rich and buttery, a couple of bites will fill you up pretty good. If you want a big sandwich, go to Seven Subs on the other side. If you want a lobster roll, come here and try not to be stingy about it."	4star
I love brunch but unfortunately Jane was only so so for me. I made a reservation for a party of three for 1PM on a Saturday but we still had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated. It was loud and crowded especially on the first floor, and seating was pretty tight. Luckily, my friends and I were seated downstairs, which was a little more spacious but freezing cold. The service was friendly but slow and unorganized. After we ordered, different servers brought the wrong items to our table more than once. There was also a lot of shouting between waiters to figure out which table ordered what.  I started my meal with a cappucino but it came luke warm and the ratio of froth to coffee was way off. The food we ordered was overall pretty average. I got the Jane Benedict, which had two poached eggs served with crab cake, sautéed spinach, tarragon hollandaise and mixed greens. The fried crab cakes were chunky and flavorful which I really liked. However, the hollandaise sauce was pretty bland and the poached eggs were slightly rubbery. My friends ordered the Seafood Cobb Salad and Wild Mushroom Omelette and felt they were pretty average as well. Overall, Jane is not a bad place to go if you're looking for a classic American brunch, but I wouldn't come here for the best brunch in the city.	3star
This is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. I love the steak and it is so fancy	5star
I had a very good meal at Obao last night. I couldn't decide between Thai or Vietnamese food, so Obao offered the best of both worlds!   I arrived around 8pm with no reservation, so I had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. No worries. I sat at the bar while waiting.  Once seated myorder was taken within a few minutes.  It took a little longer than expected to get my papaya salad, and, when it came my Bun Bo Hue was also set on the table. I pointed out to the server that the Bun would be cold before I finished the salad and they took it away. The Papaya salad (Som Tam) was good, but lacked the chiles that I am used to that give Som Tam a great heat.  Once I was done, the Bun Bo Hue was brought out and it was piping hot. The flavor and heat level were great!  I added the dried chile flakes that were provided until my lips were burning.  There was plenty of pork belly and beef in the soup, but the amount of noodles was less than other places and they were smaller pieces.  Also, the condiments (basil, bean sprouts and jalapeño slices) were a bit skimpy.  But, overall, the Bun was excellent. I enjoyed the visit and would go back, but the service timing faux pas (salad and entree arriving at the same time), the lack of noodles, and the small portion of condiments kept me from giving Obao 5 stars. If Yelp allowed 1/2 stars I would give Obao 4 1/2 stars.	4star
I visited Sylvia's once as a kid with my parents and many, many years later I wanted to see what was on the Harlem soul food restaurant scene. As usual, I scoured Yelp for answers and Amy Ruth's popped up on the screen. We decided to visit Amy Ruth's on a whim and low and behold, it was one of the highlights of our visit. Days later, I'm still thinking about the amazing meal. Their food is really good.  Quick Tips: 1) Tourists & Locals:  Amy Ruth's is more of a tourist spot, than local, but you'll see a nice mix of both dining.  2) Expect to wait: They purposely make guests stand outside for several minutes (or an hour in our case) in order to make the business appear busier than it is in reality. This is really silly because they were actually quite busy, but appeared to have enough space to accommodate most of the people. We actually witnessed people walk away frustrated by the ridiculously long wait. Bad business practice, which cost them in more ways than one. This isn't a nightclub, it is a restaurant.  3) Food: A good portion of the menu is some sort of waffle combo and the rest of the fare is typical soul food with a few extra goodies here and there. Cornbread is served. Delicious mimosas (which are also sold by the carafe) can also be ordered. The serving sizes are fair and prices are reflective of others in the city.  We opted to go for a waffle combo. I had the shrimp and waffle. Hubby had the wings and waffle. Their menu items are all named after famous African American figures. The walls are lined with murals of famous musicians. It is a fun and easygoing environment. The servers are all very polite. We were informed to 'be patient' with he kitchen, but our food arrived relatively quick. We were surprised.  That summarizes our experience at Amy Ruth's. I cannot wait to give it a try again, very soon.	4star
Super loud- I know this is the trendy thing right now but it was so loud I found it hard to enjoy.  I tried sitting at the bar and then the dining room. Both so loud my ears hurt.   The food was really great- I had the shrimp and the salmon- both I would have again.	3star
Okay food upstaged by terrible service and rude waiter. We went for brunch, not knowing that it was a prefixed menu with limited selections, all including alcohol. There are no a la carte options on the menu so you're forced to select one of the 29 dollar entrees even if you don't want the drinks that come with the preset price. As I mentioned, the food was fine but the waiter was dismissive and condescending. Would not return	3star
The service was beyond excellent. Everyone from the hostess to our waiter were super friendly and super attentive. Our waiter (Josh, I believe) was perfectly attentive and always managed to check in on us at just the right time without being intrusive at all.  We ordered and shared the baby octopus appetizer which was simply amazing. It comes warm over slightly lower than room temperature potatoes and cold, ceviche like onions and olives right under that. The combination of all the textures and flavors was simply incredible. We loved this dish and wish there was more. It's easy enough for 1 person to eat it all, but since we both ordered pasta dishes for our main course we figured we could share it and it ended up being just right.  I had the linguini special which included seafood and it was amazing. The chef took equal amounts of shrimp, mussels and some squid and distributed them evenly across the dish. The portions were just right.  To end, we ordered the Tiramisu and it was divine. It came in a martini glass which was a sexy touch, and it was rich, delicious and just enough for both of us to share.  All in all, it was a 4.5 star experience. I took .5 of a star off because the music was so random. We heard some salsa and merengue and although we like both, we feel that the music should reflect the cuisine as well as the dishes and inspiration of the overall restaurant. Apart from that, amazing time.  Thanks to the staff and the chef for a stellar evening.	4star
Really neat place just right off of all the main Broadway theaters.  Not too crowded when we first sat down but I guess once work let out the place got pretty packed.  I ordered the smoking reverend for a drink which was a bourbon and wine reduction with just a hint of antica that made it a wonderful pairing with my lamb burger. I also had tried the buffalo chicken spring rolls which were very unique and seemed like a pretty cool idea, may try to make these for a party hehe.  Service was off the chart awesome, drinks came out quickly and the food not too long later. Servers were also very attentive and made sure the whole dining experience was great.  I would definitely recommend coming here if not for the good food then for the drinks which were all show themed.	4star
A cute and trendy place right in Hell's Kitchen, Obao offers beautiful drinks, string lit ceilings, and a full menu! Came here on a Friday night around 7 for drinks before a party, and it was pretty crowded from the dinner rush. Luckily we were sat at the bar before long.  It was one of my first bars I've been to and I was still not used to the steep NYC prices, but let me tell you, the berry mojito and Long Island were delicious and poured with a heavy hand! Delicious and beautiful. We headed of afterward but I would have loved to hang out in the back where there was dim warm lights.  I'm really looking forward to coming for one of their lunch specials! I had a bite of the fried rice and it was delicious!!	3star
OBOY OBAO, I don't know how you got 4 stars, even my 3 stars are generous. I read the reviews and it looked good so we tried them out for lunch on Sunday. Before you enter the first thing I noticed was the big B rating on the front door. I take that with a grain of salt since it is a City agency in charge of these ratings but there were some reviewers complaining about dirty conditions in the restaurant. I didn't notice any obvious dirty things, maybe it was the sunglasses obscuring my view. The hostess greeted us and said there is a 10 to 15 minute wait. OK time to go, my daughter has a bus to catch at the nearby beautiful Port Authority. As I was about to walk out the door she said we could sit at the bar. That's fine so we sat at the bar and were promptly served.  They have a great deal for lunch. Entrees from $9 to $11 including an appetizer. They did not mention that the appetizer was served in baby sized bowls. I had 2 tiny shrimp dumplings which were very good. The eggplant appetizer was grilled, not seasoned and chewy. The Tom Yum soup was OK. For dinner I had the Pho Ga. It was OK but the Ga was tasteless. The pork belly banh mi was not seasoned and chewy plus it was a very small serving. I did like the atmosphere with all the cool lighting and staff was pleasant but with such a choice of restaurants in Hells Kitchen I doubt I would try it again.	3star
Summer rolls were expensive $8 for two small rolls. Clay-pot catfish was good, reminded me of home, but all in all it was quite overpriced for Vietnamese food. Bf got the pork belly which was decent. It was $50 plus tip for the 3 dishes.	2star
Service is pretty bad. Waiter never came to check on us. We asked for bread and had to ask several times to get it. We also asked for prosciutto and never got it. The place wasn't packed so there's no excuse. Kale salad was ok, drinks didn't taste like the ingredients so I suspect they water everything down.	2star
The food was okay.  we went for brunch the portions are so small I felt like we order appetizers instead off the main course	2star
Quick and short on this spot. Overall ambiance is great. The outdoor garden space is cool (both in temperature and space) with a fun fountain. It is cramped and quite loud once full though. The basement area is better for a more intimate date/ conversation with a stage set up for live jazz. You can watch the first early set for free but have to pay cover for the later 8:30pm set.  Food had some highs and lows. Great variety of pizzas with thin chewy crust and lots of flavor. Bolognese lasagna was bland, had to ask the server for a side of marinara sauce and not sure where the meat in the bolognese was. We also started with a caprese salad, the mozz was solid but otherwise it was a pretty standard app.  We were too full to try dessert, but they had a huge variety. Also lots of cocktails etc. also, wine by the glass sometimes worked out to be cheaper than a bottle. The Malbec was yuck.	3star
Ohhhh Antonio's Trattoria.  Always a good environment to have either lunch or dinner.  The service is beyond nice. Very comfortable people. They really know what they're doing. Do not miss the chance to get their Nutella Pizza as dessert ( Nutella, strawberries and banana on a sweet flat round bread)  Been here with my co-worker, and we ordered the Burrata and Fried Calamari as an appetizer oh and the pizza! It Was amazing!!!!  This restaurant is a hidden gem in little Italy of the Bronx. You Definitely need to try this restaurant.	4star
In the area for work and decided to grab dinner at Soba Totto with a friend. We walked in and instead of greeting us, the first words out of the hostess' mouth was 'Can you finish by 7:30?' I get it; it's New York. you'll have plenty of reservations even for a mediocre restaurant, but your approach could've been better. Not surprisingly, extensive sake menu and the server was happy to pour some samples. We picked dishes across the menu and aside from the yakitori options, food was bland and unremarkable. Totto salad was boring and lacked seasoning, tempura platter was fried with old oil, and the soba with duck dipping sauce was just meh. The saving grace was for sure the yakitori and in hindsight, we should've just stuck with that.	3star
Ippudo has been very trendy at the moment and with good reason. The food hits the spot for a ramen hankering. My favorite part of the orders are the savory broth.  You definitely get what you pay for at Ippudo. That includes the atmosphere. Staff shout to each other in Japanese. The lighting is quite romantic and an intimate setting making it ideal for a date. Service was attentive and the food was delivered quickly-- although the wait was over an hour.  While the ramen is quite good, I don't find it to be entirely worth the price. I would come when I'm having a specific hankering and looking to treat myself.	3star
My overall experience at naked crab was below mediocre. This restaurant has decor that make feel like I'm at a happy hour in soho, but... food is very overpriced and waiters served scanty portions.  The Lobster boil with a small stick of corn and clams and small lobster was about $40. So not worth it. A large shrimp I can find in a Chinese supermarket down the block has more meat than the lobster in the boil. There were only about 3 clams (meatless)  in there with sad broth.  Appetizer stick of corn $3 and greasy Brussels sprouts for $7. Sad. Uni pasta $28 was a small handful of cheap pasta with a tablespoon of uni. Step up your game. Turn down the volume of the radio station so we can actually fucking order and not get the wrong dish of eggs with scallops. Rant over	2star
This place is awesome! A little more modern and hip than your traditional Chinatown restaurant. they take credit card which is a definite plus. their food is a little more expensive but the food is great and the restaurant is very clean. I always get the curry beef tendon and brisket - it is amazing and the sauce is great. If I am travelling, I usually call ahead and they have my order ready. their clay pot rice is also very good and so is their congee! 10/10 definitely recommend	5star
"This is the most ridiculously boughie overrated Mexican spot ever in the history of history. And also a very blatant display of classism. A friend and I arrived there to get food and drinks. However, in the diner area, there were no alcoholic drinks. So we went around the corner to the restaurant area which is almost separated like another venue but is still part of the restaurant as a whole. The menu there was a bit more expensive with the same exact items. So we went back to the diner part and found two stools, ordered our food and waited to be called.  While waiting, there's a door that says ""employees only ""but people were coming in, people as in customers, and going past the door. There was a man guarding the door and I overheard him saying something about alcohol, so I asked him if there were drinks being served in the establishment behind the door and he said yes but you had to have a reservation to enter and drink at the bar LOL! I thought he was kidding. Until I heard how he kept turning people away who didn't have reservations, even ppl who didn't even care for the alcohol & just wanted to sit down and eat in the speakeasy part of the restaurant.  It was like a bad episode of Sex and the City  ""you're not on the list"". We sat and ate for about 25 minutes and just listened in awe at how they just shitted on people who wanted to enter to get drinks. And then we had to chuckle when they let people in who obviously weren't on the list, ""I know so and so"" ""oh okay no problem enter"". LOL.  All of this for some cheap-tasting overpriced Mexican food SMH. Not worth it if you're looking to really enjoy a meal. Spent $16 on 2 tacos and rice and still wasn't full. Save your coins."	1star
I typically avoid places that offer dishes from so many countries (in this case Thai, Vietnamese and Malaysian). To make things even more interesting, the staff here were all speaking Cantonese.  The food turned out to be pretty decent (I'd say just above average). Ordered the rendang and basil chicken (both lunch specials). They were fairly tasty, and the lunch special price was reasonable. There is also a yelp check in deal for a free small size thai ice tea, which was nice.  In short, decent food, but not worth making a trip here for it. You can get better elsewhere.	3star
Giving 5 stars means it's perfect. 5/5 for the food. The atmosphere is the only negative, it's always crowded and the wait is ridiculous. Going at lunch time (12pm) is the best cause you can beat the crowd.	4star
The service is very good, but the food is very salty, I've gone twice and felt like I should have blood pressure pills nearby. Also, not a big fan of grapes in my Guacamole, but like the salt factor, it's my personal taste. The drinks are decent, a little on the pricey side.  Decor is nice, especially the bathroom, cool sink and wallpaper. My advice? Easy on the salt unless it's on the rim of one of your margarita cocktails.	3star
Pure Thai... they should rename this restaurant to Pure Bliss because of the joy I feel while eating here!  Food 4.5/5- My go to is the ratchapuri crab and dry noodle: savory, tangy and sweet it captures so much flavor in each bite- my only complaint is that the portion is a little small, and having like just *this* much more noodles will be able to fill me up better. The spareribs in the appetizer section is also amazing- you can taste the funky of the fish sauce and get the kick of the spicy accompanying it. Ambiance 4/5 Service 4/5- I had literally come in straight from JFK with luggage + backpack in tow (thankfully it wasn't obnoxiously large) but it would have been nice to have been offered to leave it in a corner (where it was eventually placed anywhere) instead of me carrying it for half an hour while waiting for my friends who were stuck in traffic. The food service was excellent- very timely and fast. Important suggestion: this is a SMALL restaurant! A family of 10 waited for an hour to be seated AND one of the family members literally stood up and ate next to the table because there were no seats at all. I highly suggest you come here with a smaller group if you want to be seated in (1) a reasonable amount of time, (2)and actually sitting down while eating .	4star
I was very looking forward for this visit after reading all the reviews and pics. But......after eating today's lunch, I am pretty sure I will NOT visit this restaurant again ever. Food is 2 out of 5 stars, kinda of disappointed. Oyster pan cake was way too oily. The Salt and Pepper Chicken over Rice is just ok, 8/10 of the whole bowl was rice, 1/10 of the bowl was pickled cabbage and minced pork, and rest was only a few popcorn chicken, which I can only taste a lot of peper. Btw, missing the marble egg which supposed to come with the rice bowl. The only pro I can think of is the price, very cheap, but I rather go to the place offering really Taiwanese food with a dollar extra or two. Service is 0 out of 5 stars, waitresses are so rude and make you very uncomfortable to eat. When we visited this noon, the restaurant was packed, we didn't mind share a round table with others, but the waitress literally asked what we want to order after one minute we sat down and we had 30 seconds to read the menu.....Chill, I understand you want to sell to as many customers as possible, but you are losing customers because this kind of service.... Anyway, NOT recommend this one to you guys.	1star
Possibly my favorite place in the city. It can be both CASUAL or FORMAL depending on how you feel like that day. So this place has two restaurants:  The Tavern: (walk in only) Casual, a great place to bring your date to. They have great selections of wine and beer, most of them are available in half glass, so you can really taste a lot of different kinds of drinks without breaking your bank. They have some great burger that is not on the menu, and I especially like the apple tart dessert The Dining Room: (Michelin one star) I've tried their dinner tasting menu. Just WOW! I am not sure if it's the wine (we ordered 4 bottles for the 6 of us), but everything tasted amazing. I have been to almost half of the Michelin one star restaurants in NYC and I will put Gramercy Tavern as #1. The service was amazing and the staffs are knowledgeable about the dishes. I will definitely come back again when the new tasting menu is up! Tips: + the Tavern has some amazing desserts, good for people who just want to have an afternoon tea + order half glasses (they are generous on their pour), try different things + they have roasted oysters at the Tavern, amazing!	5star
"This review is on the service. I went there last Wednesday for happy hour drinks and appetizers with a friend. There were only two seats left at the bar and they were at the end of the bar nearest to the door. We sat down and I was at the last seat at the very end of the bar however I didn't have space to put a glass because of the pumpkins decor at the bar. Very pretty, I must admit. The girl bartender was sweet and moved a pumpkin so I'd have some space. I asked if she could move one more pumpkin and she did so gladly. Then the guy bartender who must have been her manager or was acting like it, told her and I, ""No, this pumpkin stays. It's there for a reason."" The girl was taken aback as was I. Hey, bro, why have seats at the bar if there's no room for people to sit there?!?!? That was the first strike. He was very abrasive. He took over and asked us if we wanted anything. He wasn't friendly, just had a  serious face. We ordered two glasses of wine and an appetizer. Then, my friend asked if he could charge his phone. The guy said, ""No, we don't do that here."" But, he did tell us to ask the hostess for a charger.  What separates a good bar from another average bar is the service. I go to to some places with average food and drinks because their service rocks. But, this guy/manager/bartender was not accommodating at all and had an attitude. We could have stayed and spent more money but after two glasses of wine and one appetizer, we hated the service so we left to another bar."	3star
I am not a fan of chicken ramen but the high reviews on Yelp brought me here. The broth lack that fattiness, creamy, salty flavor my taste buds search for whenever I have ramen. So I was not impress but I did like the chewy noodles and appreciate the fried garlic bits. Now what worth eating here is the char siu pork bun. Those alone are worth the trip and wait. I also got a bowl of the char siu mayo don which was also really good. The charred scallions and creamy mayo paired so nicely with the tender meat. YUM. So if you are not a chicken ramen person, I recommend trying a different ramen place. If you decide to go here, be prepare to wait and don't forget the order some of the appetizers.	3star
Really great restaurant, despite what a particular recent review claims happened to them.	5star
The place has a cool layout and an extensive drink menu, I liked their glasses w a Doggy on it. Their troufle fries are yummy! I had the lobster bisque which was good and their burger was ok. It has a lounge area in the basement and a party room on the second floor, I would have to come back on another night to see if it gets more happening, though I was there on a Friday night.	3star
Overpriced in cost, underwhelmed in quality.  Tiny menu.  Move along.	1star
Home. Glasserie feels like it. Unsuspecting, scaffold covered, front of the restaurant leaves the common passerby clueless (This is temporary until the construction ends). This visit left us just as satisfied as the fist time ~2 years ago. All of the staff are laid back and friendly. They were playing The Dead the entire time we were there, so it made for a meal like we were at..home. Ordered a Hudson Baby bourbon and a Other Half IPA. Fresh tap! Labneh and grilled flat bread - spot on! Chicken Kibbe - amazing This is not a lamb burger - a little greasy, but impossible to stop eating Bulgarian Feta, Tomato, Onion & Za'atar - 3:1 tomato to cheese ratio. That was my only issue wit this dish. Otherwise, the feta was delicious with the za'atar dusted on top.  We'll be seeing you soon.	5star
"I ended up here for Sunday brunch with a couple friends earlier this week. It's a cute, small space, and the service was quick and friendly. Be warned though - if you're going for brunch and don't want to wait, get there early! It was mostly empty when we arrived, but within 20 minutes, it was packed and there were people waiting outside. I'd say aim for 10:30 if you don't want to wait (that's about the time that we got there). The good: I had the super awesome biscuits and gravy. Yum yum. The biscuit was HUGE and delicious, and they are generous with the bits of sausage in the gravy. My friends just ordered a bunch of sides, and the hash browns looked amazing - all toasted and crunchy and brown on the outside. I hesitate to say ""the bad"" but I'll just say ""The reasons I won't be schlepping out to Red Hook to go to this place again"": To drink, I had the iced coffee. I've gotta say - blech. Tastes like they just cooled down hot-brewed coffee. This makes it really, really bitter. I wish they had cold-brewed coffee, which is super easy, keeps well, and tastes almost chocolatey. But mama needed her caffeine and I refuse to give up summertime drinks just yet. Oh, and for sugar, they just have little uncovered pots of raw sugar on the table. I wasn't sure what it was at first, when I realized that it was sugar for the coffee, I thought that was unsanitary, especially after I saw the kid at the next table put his fingers in the pot of sugar. The coffees (my friends both got hot coffee) came without spoons, and the server was busy, so we just used our forks to chip away at the solidified raw sugar. I guess the humidity got to it. I'd never thought of sugar packets as a luxury until now."	2star
Cute place! Great service and expansive sake list. Overall the food was ok, nothing extraordinary that I would come back for. If you're in the neighborhood, its a decent choice!	4star
Had the cumin lamb noodles and the pork burger. Noodle dish was  flavorful! My only critique is that there was a lot of oil that collected at the bottom of the container, made me wanna drain it out. Pork burger tasted just alright. Not rushing to go back but I'd still say I had a nice meal with the noodles in particular.	3star
Came here based on Yelp reviews! Thanks yelpers, it was awesome! Very cozy italian place, and great people who work here. The older gentleman at the bar was such a character and came around to all the tables for a quick chat.  About the food. Notable items were the arancini and the lasagna pizza. The pizza was amazing as it should be in little Italy and the lasagna pizza was something I hasn't seen before. The waiter recommended it as a first timer there and didn't regret it one bit! Arancini was also delicious. The wine list was a little on the average side but still decent and I was happy with what I ordered.	4star
For the price, this place is OK. I got the grand slam for $13 after a night of drinking and it definitely hit the spot. While it is not of the best quality, you get your moneys worth in the quantity served. Chicken and pork katsu, hard boiled eggs, shrimp tempura and some rice. It is a pretty good deal but the taste is just OK at best. Good for a quick bite.	3star
This being my second time returning here, I will not spend any time or money at this establishment again.  We came in for happy hour. A group of four which grew to six, as other friends joined us. We didn't have a reservation and were directed to the bar--told to order at the bar and seat ourselves upstairs. We ordered 3 wines($6ea.), 12 grilled oysters($1.50ea.) and 12 wings($1ea.) for happy hour to start as we waited for the rest of our friends. The wings were brought up first, the cajun seasoning on them was good but some were so skinny they looked like mozzarella sticks. We waited 30 mins and still no drinks. We had to go back down to the bar to remind them. We get the drinks and oysters a few mins later. We ask the waitress for utensils, plates, napkins.... she brings forks and rolls her eyes. So I guess we were expected to share the platter of oysters communal style. The others came and ordered the lobster roll, crab fritters, and seafood nachos-- the all said their dishes were OK. The only thing worth this terrible service were the grilled oysters, which were delicious.	1star
Felice is a nice place to find tucked into the FiDi. The bar is great and the ambience of Gild Hall helps a lot. I had breakfast here and it was ok. I ordered eggs, bacon, sunflower toast. My husband and brother in law both had the French Toast. My husband added a side of sausage to his meal too. I tried their French toast and really liked it. The sausage was really good too. Maybe the best breakfast sausage I've had. I liked the sunflower toast. Really delicious. I was just disappointed in the soggy bacon and eggs cooked over well when I ordered them over medium. I just don't understand how they'd send out a plate with eggs so obviously cooked wrong instead of taking the few minutes and cooking the order properly.	3star
Loved it!  Food was great. Drinks were decent.  Lacking one star due to issue with seating: our reservation mattered not: we were seated 45 minutes after our confirmed time while a group who entered after we did was seated before us. Not the best start to the evening, but the food and ambiance made up for it to a 4 star review.	4star
We ordered the ricotta with honey, mozzarella wrapped prosciutto, mezzaluna ravioli, and gnocchi. Delicious food -- everything was wonderful. Ambiance really loud and made conversation difficult. Good for groups	4star
Slow service, mediocre food. Lobster Mac n cheese was very watery and milky. Sliders had burnt buns (really???). Shrimp tempura desperately needed a sauce. The tuna burger and spinach weren't too bad, but definitely wouldn't come back just for it. We also asked a server to cut our burger and she forgot to do so....it's not difficult when the place is half empty! I don't get it.	3star
3.5 stars.. I came here with a friend for a weekend dinner before going to a show and upon walking in, I loved the atmosphere here. The decor is rustic and beautiful - really pretty lanterns from the ceiling, I felt like I was in a forest.  However, the service was subpar. The food did come out quickly but our server kept asking us if we were ready to order multiple times while my friend and I were trying to figure out what to order. Not only that, our server also took away our food before I was done with it. Yes granted, there was a little left, but geez, shouldn't be rushing people especially there aren't people waiting on line to get a table. It was a little too much for me and felt rushed. I would have enjoyed my experience here much more if this didn't happen because the ambiance is actually quite relaxing here.   For drinks, we ordered the Yuzu Lemonade and the Thai Tea. Both we really good and served in mason jars (love!) but if you are looking for something refreshing, different and perfect the summer... definitely get the Yuzu Lemonade!  Plus, you get Thai Tea at any Asian/Thai restaurant. To start, we ordered the Thai Herbed Wings appetizer and it was good. For entrees, we got the Green Curry and Duck Pad See-Ew. I would order them again as both were pretty good but I thought the portion size on the Pad See-Ew was on the smaller side. Prices are also a bit higher than your average Thai restaurant.. but it is in the city after all and the ambiance makes up for it.	4star
This review is based on delivery only because I have never been to the restaurant in person but often order delivery.  I love their food and the quality is consistent. However, service isn't. Once I was trying to order Fried Buns and the waiter taking the call didn't even know it was on the menu and got my order wrong lmao, despite me repeating the order again and again. When the delivery guy got here I had to call the restaurant again, it was a horrible waste of time. Depending on the person taking the call, sometimes the person doesn't speak very good English. They are very busy so it may also takes a long time to wait for the person to get on the line properly. They also don't always give the things I asked for because they're too busy, ex. extra sauce.	3star
Amazing staff. Amazing food. Amazing atmosphere. It's my go to spot in South Park Slope. I can always count on a good time.	5star
Great food but the crappiest service I've ever had in NYC. We waited over an hour for rice and chicken after the waiter forgot our order. Very little care was taken of us the whole night even after the delayed meal. The shrimp buns are the best though!	2star
"The all you can eat brunch is a steal. To be fair, it's not really all you can eat: the portions are small and after a few refills, they start giving you ""the look"", but it's still a great deal. The food is good, the waiters are nice, and the place is gorgous."	5star
Obao has a beautiful upstairs section that i suggest you try grabbing. decorated very nicely, and you can people watch 9th ave like i did while you drink and eat and get some good laughs. the service here is great. happy hour on saturdays which is amazing--this never happens in the city. the shrimp spring rolls were good, a bit skimp on the shrimp but the peanut sauce was good. the vegetarian bun was okay, it needed a bit more flavor but was a huge portion for the price.	3star
Walked in here to a super cozy setting for brunch, slowly my 5 stars began going down. First of my eggs had what seemed to be an eyelash so I stopped eating my food, but my husband asked the waiter for a soda and I asked for hot sauce and we never got them :( first time here and unfortunately won't be coming back.	2star
Pretty good, attentive service for a Chinese restaurant. Food is prompt and pretty delicious. A great noodle selection, along with some other dishes. Clean. Well priced.	4star
We can never get into this place as it is always packed. We had high hopes for it. During the Bay Ridge Friday Stroll they had a food set up outside. We tried the taco (super small for $5). Then we had chips with salsa and guacamole. That was also tiny for $5 and meh. We tried the Pineapple drink and it was strong. Overall, we are glad we got to try it but we won't go back. $20 for nothing. Oh well!	1star
Had no problems before but the last couple of times I ordered something the delivery guy was late and not pleasant at all. I do not know if they just hired this new guy but it is giving them bad advertising.	1star
They took the xlb off the menu.  Stupid stupid stupid.  They were the best in town and now I have no reason to come here anymore	1star
It was not a good dining experience.   There were nice, private rooms and an extensive menu. The service, though, was slow and we had to ask to speed up the time between dishes.   There was variance in the dishes.  The beef stew was tasty, but the fried chicken was covered with thick batter.  The sashimi was up to standard, but the grilled vegetables lacked flavor.  The sesame homemade tofu was very good. The experience, unfortunately, ended on a sour note.  A glass of wine was sent back because it tasted badly.  An argument ensued with the manager who would not remove the glass of wine from the bill and argued about the taste.  Instead, he charged 50% of the price of the glass.  The total bill was over $180 so this felt petty.  It was quite unpleasant.     There are a number of other izakayas in NYC that have better food, better service and more reasonable staff.	2star
A nice and upscale restaurant for grabbing a good brunch as well as dinner. A lot of good meat-friendly dishes but the are some nice vegetarian options too. Has a bunch of good deserts options.	4star
We have been waiting over an hour for some tacos. They're out of guac. And mezcal. Nobody else has been served yet either. In the whole place. Hey... order just showed. But it's not our food. Going great so far. Maybe skip this place.	1star
I love a lobster roll so had to try here. And it was sooooo good!!! The lobster taste like it was just caught so fresh. Must have the classic. Their Bloody Mary was delicious too, to too thick not too thin. I will definitely be back here soon . Yummy!	4star
"Cozy restaurant, with ""solid"" food that was actually pretty soft because my friend had just gotten his wisdom teeth removed and could only eat soft foods.  Came here for lunch with a two friends on a Thursday around 12PM. The waiter was very friendly and told us that this restaurant has been open for 28 years, and they have /recently/ relocated. This place was not crowded at all, and in fact, a bit empty.  I ordered the chicken pot pie and my two friends both ordered the penne. The penne was pretty soft so it fit the criteria. The chicken pot pie was SO BIG and they are very generous with the portions. It seemed like they had the chicken soup underneath and then just stuck a piece of bread on top. There was no delicious crust, but overall the chicken pot pie was still VERY good!  The bathrooms, if you're curious, are also very very clean."	4star
Habana has been around for some time, but my first visit was only recent as it was recommended for their great ambience, particularly the summer, plus for the great (summery) food of course. Couldn't agree more; I am a big fan of some good Cuban food, and this might be on a new spot for it on the personal favorites list. I definitely want to go back and try more on the menu, which is mostly, if not all, enticing. An update will be needed but for now, I think this place deserves another 4 star review. A must order for starters is the Grilled Corn Mexican style. Now you ask why something simple like corn is a must. I apparently have lived under a rock for some time, but this might be the street corns of all street corns, at least here in NYC. Sweet, savory and a bit spicy, it is all delicious flavors, corn is grilled perfectly. Two corns are part of the minimum per order. Highly recommend this dish at it is one of their best known staple dishes. Entrees sounded amazing, yet I decided to go with the Huevos Rancheros a Caballo -- Grilled skirt steak and our famous Huevos Rancheros served with rice and beans. My boyfriend had the same. It was definitely a solid choice on both our ends. Portion size was perfect. The steak was cooked just right (medium rare) and was not chewy. With a runny egg on top (I had mine sunny), it couldn't be better. A thin layer or two of tortilla lay atop the steak. The rice and beans were great as a side. All in all, this was a hearty dish worth trying. Everything was delicious. I'd like to try their Cuban sandwich on a future visit. The food was amazing, and I did enjoy their ambience as well. It is a small but cute corner restaurant with lots to offer. Add this one to your list for Cuban food if you haven't made a trip yet. Note there could be a small wait for a table. It is on the smaller side in terms of space. No reservations taken.	4star
Went there for brunch today. All of the servers were super nice and the food was delicious. Definitely a place worth visiting again soon.	4star
Not a lot of shanghainese restaurants in Brooklyn so this a welcome addition. I have to say that the food is phenomenal and decently authentic. We got it delivered from Caviar, and everything tasted exceptional. Keep up the good work guys!	5star
$20 for a one pound lobster, either grilled or steamed, with fries and a small salad. The lobster came out perfectly cooked and tender. It was enough food for a light dinner, but you can always sub out the one pounder for a one and half pounder for $28. The place is always crowded and at first it seems like it's going to be a huge wait because of the people standing outside the door or near the bar. We were quoted 30 mins, and it went a lot quicker. It's probably a pretty high turnover because the food comes out just a few minutes after you put in the order and it doesn't take that long to eat a lobster! Overall, I'd come again because it takes the hassle out of buying a lobster, cleaning, cooking, and then more cleaning.	4star
I wanted to love this place as I went based on recommendations from my Japanese coworkers. Sadly Ootoya did not live up to my expectations.  I will say I like the concept of the restaurant. It feels very authentic Japanese with the menu and how the food is served. I wish there were more Japanese restaurants in the U.S. like this instead of all the Asian fusion places.  I went in for lunch around 2:30pm. Since I was eating by myself and I didn't feel like waiting for a table, I took the only empty seat at the bar. In retrospect, I wish I had waited for a table because my seating was a big reason as to why my experience wasn't as enjoyable as it could have been. My seat was right next to the narrow entry of the restaurant, so people were constantly going in and out and getting too close for comfort.  I got the mini salmon don and the special drink, the Sakura cocktail, made with sparkling peach wine and pickled cherry blossoms. The drink was delicious, but the food left much to be desired.  The salmon wasn't the worst, but it didn't taste very fresh. The sushi rice didn't have any flavor. My meal also came with soba noodles, pickled vegetables, miso soup, and steamed egg custard (which I personally cannot stomach). Everything was okay but nothing stood out to me.  I'm not giving a lower rating because I feel like I went in an off day. While I didn't have the best experience, I would still be willing to go to Ootoya again and try one of their other dishes. Next time I would go for one of the cooked dishes because it doesn't seem like sushi and sashimi is their strong point.	3star
Every where I travel, I must get my French fix so I made a reservation for brunch/lunch. When  we entered, we were greeted with men speaking French which I really like. We were seated near the window in the front. I asked them if I can get a bigger table because we usually order a lot of food to try.  I wanted the escargote or the chicken liver mousse but our server told us to order the warm pistachio crusted goat cheese ball. OMG! It's so good with fresh french bread. Yum! My husband ordered the Amelie Burger and I had gotten the duck leg confit with banana creme brulee. Our meal was so good. It was a great start to start our day in NYC. We had perfect time here and the service was so great. I will definitely try to be back here to try their other dishes.	4star
How did I not know Bea existed with their bottomless brunch? What we ordered (2 of us): brioche French toast (x3- the best!), fruit cup, bacon x2, eggs Benedict, pork shoulder, twice baked potato, spinach pie.  What we wanted order but didn't because we didn't pace ourselves- pear salad, house ricotta Not so great - asparagus. Didn't care for it ;/ Drinks were great- we got the mimosa and grapefruit beermosa.	5star
"There's nothing particularly wrong with this place other than it's a little overpriced. I think that when two terms almost contradictory terms are placed together, omakase and izakaya, izakaya probably takes greater precedence. For an izakaya, it's pretty good. For an $80 / person omakase, you probably have a lot of better options in the area or if you wanted to come here, you were probably better off just choosing dishes yourself off the menu.  Dish 1: Appetizer - 2 slices stewed eggplant, 2 slices duck breast, 2 scoop tofu Dish 2: Grilled Vegetable plate - 1 shitake mushroom, 1 asparagus, 1/2 oyster mushroom Dish 3: Sashimi plate - 2 slices snapper, 2 slices salmon, 2 slices eel Dish 4: Grilled fish plate - 1/2 salmon fish collar Dish 5: Grilled meat plate - 3 pieces beef, 1 shitake mushroom, 1 shishito pepper Dish 6: Rice - One bowl glutinous rice with mushrooms The entire experience left me with the feeling of ""Really? We're done here? Really?"" The food isn't bad per se. It's much more that the quality is what you'd expect for a $40 / person place not an $80 / person place. The atmosphere is lively and people are quite loud (compared to other Japanese places). I can see how you would considering going there to drink with your friends, and it just happens to serve some reasonable tasting food. In the end, I can only blame myself for forgetting that despite it's reviews this is just an izakaya."	2star
Found this while just driving around Queens Blvd one afternoon and I was not disappointed. Drinks were good, so was the food and the service. We had the skirt steak lollipops and the tacos. I will definitely be making a second visit.	5star
A whole restaurant devoted to BACON! YES! Unfortunately, execution failed. Service was average, if that... Just 2 of us for dinner on a Sunday night, our meals weren't brought out together, even though we'd both ordered our bacon sliders at the same time. Mine were to be cooked medium rare while hers medium well, but mine arrived about 7 minutes after hers. However, both sets of sliders were very good, and cooked as requested. My friend also ordered a sandwich, which she devoured, even though it arrived last, separately, after we'd eaten all the sliders. I'd also ordered tater tots, which came with the 2nd set of sliders, but I wasn't impressed. In fact, I couldn't eat more than three of them. On the menu, they were described as being dusted with bacon-flavored salt, but all I could taste was salt - not bacon, not potatoes, JUST SALT. Worth noting, drinks were pricey here, even for Manhattan. We ordered their summer special - sweet tea with vodka & mint - amazing, indeed, but $15 apiece, and just an average size. I'm glad we tried this place, but I'm not sure I'll eat here again.	3star
I'm only giving  it 2 stars because the food was good.  I had a reservation for 8pm and wasn't seated until 8:45. The dining experience was slow but tasty.  Then after the meal, my friend couldn't find her phone then realized the staff threw it in a garbage with the table paper. After asking the staff to look for it they said they looked, but didn't find it. So we took matters in our own hands and looked for ourself through 5 garbage bags on the street in the snow. Finally finding it in the bottom of the last bag. With an awful ending to a tasty bad serviced meal, we left with the owner offering a free dinner... but after that... no thanks.	2star
"Uva is good but something was missing from our meal.   The service was shaky. The restaurant is NYC crowded and alive on a weekend night with a nice back patio. The appetizers were very good, we shared the meatballs, mozzarella, and artichokes. The short rib just didn't have the flavor I was expecting for a braised short rib dish which was not aided by the rosemary potato ""cake"" accompanying it being lukewarm and bland with an odd texture."	3star
The turkey was crazy good... and BIG! Enjoyed chilling here with my friends last winter season!	4star
This was one of the best, if not the best, dinner I've had in New York. We came several months ago in the winter when the line for Hanoi House was 1.5 hours, and the line at Thursday Kitchen was ~45 minutes. I think that the hype has spread enough by now that the wait is much longer, but judging from that dinner, it would still be absolutely worth it. The service was really attentive throughout without being cloying or hovering, and I don't think there was a time when our water glasses were unfilled, which was appreciated. I'm a vegetarian and we split four vegetarian tapas - the edamame dumplings, mapo tofu, angry sweet potato, and the gnocchi. The dumplings came out first. The waiter was so effusive about the dish as he delivered it that we were immediately skeptical - we've had our fair share of dumplings! - but one bite in, and they completely lived up to expectations (and more). These were truly the best dumplings I've ever had. The hint of truffle flavoring the mashed edamame filling in a super soft, yet sturdy wrapper - these are absolutely a must-get. The table next to us squeezed in a second to-go order of the dumplings right as the kitchen was closing, which I now realize was an incredible idea. The sweet potato was the perfect amount of spicy and crispy, coming a close second for my favorite dish, though the mapo tofu wasn't far behind. The tofu is served in a really interesting way and comes with chips to dip in the super flavorful sauce, which I absolutely love. The sauce is so good, any good way to enjoy it is absolutely something that should happen! I'm never a huge, huge gnocchi / pasta fan, but this was really good as well, not too heavy, and nice for sharing after a veggie-centric  My boyfriend tried the eel taco, which he said was really good (though it doesn't seem to be offered on the menu). Still, he ranked any of the four veggie tapas that we got above the tacos, which is always impressive - I love when a restaurant can do vegetables in a really interesting and flavorful way.	5star
We went last night and the peppercorn cocktail I ordered was tasty, as were the truffle fries. I was with a group of new friends, all of whom had just met at a writerly event at The Grolier Club nearby. Everything was great until the waiter accused us of stealing his pen. He'd placed a few pens on the table, but not enough for our party of six, so we had to pass them around. It was incredibly awkward - no one could produce his pen. He said he'd paid a lot of money for these pens. (I'd just paid $16 for a cocktail so I could sympathize.) We all looked on the floor, trying to appease him. Still no pen. He let it go and we slunk out, wondering what had just happened.  For the record, the pens were just some sort of Bic. Nothing elaborate or worth the freaky confrontation. I waited tables for a long time and can't imagine throwing down on strangers who'd just tipped me about a PEN.  It was an awful way to end an otherwise lovely evening.	2star
Friendly staff but food prices off the scales.. it's Station  re booted... with 40% price increase. If you are on a date night or out to impress there's better places in the neighborhood . If you are looking for fish tacos... walk one block to creek and cave.. it 50 percent cheaper	2star
"On Sunday, we specifically drove to Crab Shanty for the lobster dinner which is advertised on their website for $18.99. We got there and it was very crowded so we waited about 30 minutes to get a table and had a pina colada in the bar area (the bartenders are great - make a great drink and friendly).  We finally got seated and, when the waiter (who was nice) came by to take our order, I asked for the 18.99 special lobster dinner which is advertised on their website -- he told me that the lobster was now 22.99 so I asked for the manager.  In addition to the website, there was a special card on the table that said the lobster dinner was 19.99 - except for Saturday evening after 4 pm when there was a $3 surcharge  - SO NOW WE HAVE TWO PRICES.  When the manager came, he was one of the nastiest people I've ever met - so much for customer service.  When I explained about their advertising different prices, he became totally defensive and argumentative. He said there was a sign outside that said $22.99 (neither my friend nor I saw a sign as there were many people milling around outside waiting for tables) so obviously not in plain sight.  I told him, by law, you can't advertise different prices in different places and then, when people arrive and order, you charge them more.  My male friend also tried to explain the issue but the manager didn't want to hear any of it and kept repeating, ""if you have the lobster, it's 22.99"".  I said I wasn't going to have it and was going to report the discrepancies to the appropriate agencies as well as write a review (which made one of the waitresses who was listening laugh hysterically).  He then thought about it a minute and said I could have the lobster for 18.99 without the soup/salad or accompaniments which are all advertised with the dinner - thanks for nothing -  and then he tried saying that my drink was on him but we had already paid for it so that wasn't happening.   All the time, there was ZERO courtesy, respect or cordiality.  He was one of the worst managers/people I've ever run into and I will never spend another nickel in this restaurant.   Make sure you know how much you're spending when you order or the bill may surprise you!!  We went somewhere else for dinner."	1star
"Dead crispy bug found in granola / yogurt. The servers acted nice and said they'd take care of everything, but charged us for the meal. Recommendation to everyone: when you have a bug in your food, create a scene. That's the only way you'll be served right by these people. By way of background, I'm a loyal patron of Maialino. Over the past 6 years, I've been to Maialino maybe over 30 times - breakfasts, lunches, brunches, dinners, which is a lot given numerous options in the city. Their food is good, but their service has always been top notch which is why I used to like them, until today. 10am today (Saturday, August 28th) my friends and I were seated at the back of the dining room. So, from the entry way, it would be on the right side. I ate about three scoops of granola / yogurt while catching up with my friends who I hadn't caught up in a while. I looked at my granola and saw a raisin piece with 6 legs or so. Weird. I fish it out with my knife and it was clear it was a bug. At that point I call the server calmly and ask for it to be removed. I got sick to the stomach but didn't want to cause a scene given that I haven't seen my friends in a while. They brought me the same dish, and I said I have no interest and I'd prefer just a juice - less chance of a bug in a juice. At this point, I was feeling sick to the stomach thinking about all the bugs I could've eaten while I didn't look at my bowl, but as a cordial guest who has loved Maialino and believed Maialino would do the right thing, I didn't complain. The servers I remember is the lady with the see through white polka dot shirt and two guys with beards. I should have gotten their names. They made the right initial gestures ""you're now going to be taken care of"" ""this happens but should never happen"" but failed to do the right thing in hospitality. There was a bug on the dining table. Any restaurant of your caliber, especially a Danny Meyer restaurant which prides on hospitality, would have comped the meal that was only $100 among three people.  I did not want a fresh granola / yogurt, I couldn't even finish the carrot juice because I felt sick, they gave a banana muffin which I didn't feel like eating much of - just glad my friends liked it. I left early because I felt sick sitting there and also believed Maialino would do what's right. Instead, they charged my friends who were too nice to complain. I've trusted Maialino but will no longer be returning. If anything, I'm questioning the quality of Danny Meyer restaurant standards of hospitality after having experienced this. I usually only post positive reviews on Yelp, but because I've loved Maialino so much, the disappointment is too great to just pass by.  If the only way you comp a meal is by having the patron complain, you're really not doing yourself a service. I've been loyal, wanted to be a polite, understanding guest despite the bug / bugs I could have eaten. Because I didn't create a scene, you decided I was a patron you could ignore & charge for a brunch with a bug on a plate. The fact that you couldn't comp a $100 meal is absolutely disgusting after the 30 times I've visited. You're better than that."	1star
Wonderful breakfast! Quick and friendly service. The atmosphere is quirky and very cute. I had the panino con frittata and it was delicious. Very light, and yet extremely satisfying. The coffee was also quite good, not at all bitter or acidic. Would definitely come back!	4star
I couldn't wait to get here! When you walk in there are portraits of well known Black celebs painted on the wall, the dining areas were packed and we went on a Monday night! We were seated within 5 minutes of arrival. No sooner than we were sat there was cornbread placed in front of us and glasses of water. One thing I loved is that each meal is named after a Black person () Our server came and took our orders really quick, I ordered the fried shrimp and grits w/corn and potato salad on the side. My son had the chicken and waffles. No lie, within 15 minutes our food was ready. And let me tell you how amazing it was!! I literally had no complaints. The shrimp was seasoned and fried to perfection, the grits were the perfect consistency and the sides were on point. My son even said this was the best food he's eaten and he's a very picky little guy. I can't wait to return again:)	5star
The food here is so yummy, but the service is not exactly welcoming. A bit of a damper on our festive occasion. Our server was a bit unpleasant, which was a shame because with so many amazing restaurants in the area, means I'd rather go somewhere else for the next get-together.	2star
let's face it, in NYC, there's much better and more worth it italian food to be had! Pepolino was pricey for the quality AND the service was SUPER SLOW! it took them 30 min AFTER our RSVP to take our first orders i liked most of the NON-pasta dishes, their pasta is nothing special & NOT served al dente --complimentary bread: a white & a foccacia, comes with a YUMMY tomato flan for spreading --soft shell crab salad: another special that day, one of the dishes i actually liked! --antipasto toscano: the cheeses on this platter were good, but you can't really mess that up --lamb: kinda dry, not at all tender --ricotta & spinach gnocchi: i've definitely had better --pappardelle w/ beef & peas: special of the day, just okay --veal ragu pasta: bland, did not live up to the hype --ricotta cheesecake: light but nothing to rave about NOTE: they WILL NOT let you put parmesan on a seafood pasta dish, big no no, even if you ask for it overall, just not a positive experience	2star
"This was one of the coolest bars I have ever been to. As I passed by it a second time I realized... there was an upstairs and a downstairs. We were just getting a couple of drinks before Colbert and this place has an awesome cocktail menu. They also have one of the coolest tasting cocktails I have ever had. I hate gimmicks. Unless the gimmick is actually perfectly executed in every facet. This place has this awesome drink that they use a smoker on. It looks cool while they are making it and to my surprise it tasted just like a campfire. ""It tasted like flames in your mouth?"" You know when you char your marshmallow just a tiny bit, that is the flavor that is present in every sip of the drink. Nostalgic and quite delicious mix in with the sweetness of the bourbon. The other two drinks were also delicious but not as memorable, but delicious. You can't smoke everything. Well... I guess actually you can and maybe this place should do that. THE VERDICT: Perfect starter, they also have a bathroom... something the Ed Sullivan theatre doesn't allow you to use after a taping. I guess I should say CBS... shame on your CBS I bet you are reading this review right now while you are counting your billions of dollars... you win this round. If you ever got rid of all your laugh track shows I might actually watch your station. Sorry. Back to delicious drinks. Gotta stop by and try the smoked drink it was so good."	5star

I want to give Melba's a higher rating because it's such a Harlem staple, and the food is very good. But recently, this restaurant has gone downhill. I've gone maybe 3 or 4 times in the last month or so, and each time there's been an issue with the kitchen. I believe there's a ventilation problem and the entire restaurant becomes smoked out. So much that they have to shut the restaurant down. In the middle of the afternoon - on a Sunday, probably the biggest day of the week for the fresh out of church brunch crowd. I'm not sure what the issue is, but they need to fix it fast. I'd hate to see Harlem lose a great place.  On a brighter note- the staff is still very nice and the food is still awesome. On my most recent visit, I got the catfish and waffles with a side of eggs and my friend got the catfish and French toast with a side of home fries. Both a home run.	3star
They say NY has the best pizzas so we traveled from CA to give it a shot! It's different because Nee Yorkers like their pizzas plain, and we add a ton of heavy toppings to make it flavorful. I ordered the Margherita Pizza (sauce, cheese, and basil) but decided to add Mushrooms and Pepperoni (: It was delicious! The slices were thin and crispy and at the same time it complimented the flavors in the pizza.	5star
I went there on a Sunday and we seated in the basement cause first floor was packed. Basement isn't bad, it's just a little stuffy but it was great since there was one beside us. I got the Pan fried chicken veggie dumplings (6for$4.75), chicken and shrimp fried rice ($9.00), and Pan fried chicken skinny noodles ($8.50). I loved the fried dumpling, they were crispy yet chewy. The pan fried was really good too. Huge portion with enough shrimps+chicken and enough seasoning. Lastly, skinny noodles were okay. Not as delicious as the other two but good portion and enough amount of meat. Also, the service was really good. I really appreciate the lady's help. I'm definitely going there soon.	5star
Service was great.  Thats also why I think they deserved good rating.  We went in a party of 4. It was weekday at 7p. Wait was 15 minutes for 4 at the bar.  The host had said it would be a 30minutes wait.   Caution: it's cash only.  I am critical of good noodle.  There are varies types: ramen, udon, soba, hand pulled, spaghetti, etc. This ramen tasted fresh but not made at the location. Noodle made at location has a more moist texture.  I think their focus is broth. Miso broth (in Miso Paitan) was too thick.  Their speciality dish Mega Paitan is too pricy. Their Chicken Paitan broth was regular.  Their side item Char Siu Pork Bun was a bit salty.   Environment isn't for kids. It's for grown ups that appreciate music of all types including expressive language.   Bathroom is extremely tiny and the last table sitting so close to the bathroom door made the environment seem unhealthy for dining for those people.   I am glad I tried it once.  I probably won't really go again because of the crowd and tiny space.	3star
I wasn't that impressed by their pizza but maybe because since I don't eat dairy anymore, pizza without cheese is just not as good. Anyway, The line to get in this place gets very long during dinner time. I waited for a table for 6 people for about 30 mins.  Started off dinner with some meatballs. These were really good. Moist and soft and flavorful. Would highly recommend. Then also got spaghetti and meatballs which was a really small portion and the spaghetti tasted like those canned ones. Was not impressed   On to the pizza. Ordered the marinara which was just sauce on the pizza dough and the margherita pizza and no 4 (tomato, mozzarella, arugula and mozzarella). They sauce was good because it was fragrant and had lots of garlic which I like. However, the crust an dough were such a miss. It was hard, and kind of tasted burnt and I didn't enjoy it too much and we all know pizza is all about the crust!!  Anyway, personally to me; this place is a tourist trap in a touristy neighborhood. I will go elsewhere for pizza.	3star
I come here often and usually order the small order of Fried Dumplings and the #2 Beef Brisket Noodle Soup. The Dry Minced Pork Noodle is also good. This place is really barebones and the Menu is written in permanent marker, much of the staff doesn't speak English and it's sort of a mess (except their bathroom which is oddly clean) however the staff is friendly and the food is out of control good. Chewy perfect noodles, amazing broth and very well cooked brisket. They have a very good chilli oil which I apply in copious quantities to everything :)  This place is an absolute must try for anyone that likes Chinese food and lives in NYC	5star
came on a Thursday night with bae. he called earlier and the hostess said we didn't need reservations. I get there and I see that everyone in the restaurant is super classy looking (great crowd) and the restaurant workers are all recognizable (wearing specific work uniforms) first off, the service here is incredible. our waiter was always checking in on us, and very helpful when I needed help finding the bathroom.  on to the food- I ordered the pappardelle bolognese and my date ordered the black spaghetti. I didn't get to try his as I'm allergic to seafood but my bolognese was very good - I asked them to put more grated cheese on top.  finally for dessert, I ordered the olive oil cake which came with a scoop of olive oil gelati. the cake was nice, not too sweet, but the gelati was the best part. it was slightly salted and a good balance of salty and sweet. would recommend getting this dessert.  ps this place has coat check :-)	5star
*CASH ONLY* Decor: 3/5 Service: 4/5 Food: 4/5 Space is very limited. Expect to be seated next to strangers.  They speak some English so it shouldn't be terribly difficult to order food.  Boiled dumplings $3 for 8 pcs were not bad. Good value except when you notice it was $3 for 10 pcs not too long ago. The minced pork with dry noodles wasn't very appetizing. Too rich and fat.	4star
I am Burmese and it is difficult to find food Burmese food in the city. A friend recommended this place and as soon as I tasted the Shan noodles, I was filled with nostalgia and immense happiness. The Shan noodles here are amazing. The whole reason I would travel from white plains to come here. PLEASE BRING BACK THE SHAN NOODLES!!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE BRING BACK THE SHAN NOODLES!!!	5star

You need work. You've lost your touch. I brag about you guys to everyone when I found you in Orange County before you got to NYC. I used to come almost once a week when you got here. You were awesome and consistent with incredible service. Last night I looked like I was drowning in water begging for attention from my waiter. The food was like it sat under the lamp for a few minutes after it was made making it go cold not even halfway thru the meal. It was not the umami I know and love. I'm very disappointed. My umami tat is gotta go on hold until I get back to Cali and see if you've lost your charm. I'm sad.	2star
"My wife and a friend sat down for dinner around 6 on a Saturday night. Since the restaurant features cocktails and oysters and it was relatively early, I thought it would be appropriate to order drinks and food as we desired them as opposed to ordering more traditionally. Unfortunately, the passive aggressive behavior of the server indicated otherwise. Over the course of an hour and 15 minutes we spent $120 dollars on drinks and food, but the fact that we didn't follow the social norms of ordering led the server to place salt and pepper on our table, then ""realize her mistake"" place it on our neighbors table and comment ""oh- they're not even eating."" We endured painfully fake smiles, and the rather obvious complaints to the manager who seemed to be encouraging the gossipy, passive aggressive vibe. On one of the harassingly frequent visits to our table to ""check in"" my wife touched the server on the arm and asked ""is everything okay."" ""Oh! Of course! Of course!"" This attempt at an adult intervention failed and sent the server back to the manager for more glances and comments.   Overall, I found the behavior of both the server and the manager to be bizarrely irrational. There was no one waiting for our table, we were polite and direct, and simply wanted to order as we felt the need to drink or eat. Perhaps Walter's should lay down some linen tablecloths and hire old-timey, mustachioed cartoon servers who might more clearly enforce the social norms of the restaurant.  If I know there are rules, I will gladly follow them. But this kind of irrational, passive aggressive behavior is not fitting an adult in any setting. I shouldn't have to ""take the high road"" with a server and we still left a good tip, but I definitely wouldn't encourage any friends to eat there and I've been dining on Dekalb for at least 15 years."	2star
I came here for a quick lunch with a friend on a Sunday afternoon, before catching a movie at the theater nearby. It was 12:30 and I was expecting the place to be a ghost town but surprisingly, there were quite a few diners there already.  As any true Yelper would do, I did my research on which dish seemed to be the most popular. By pictures and reviews, it seemed to be Kao Moo Krob (crispy pork over rice). So that's what I ordered and I also decided to get a fried egg to go with it, because why the hell not? Most of the pieces of pork were fatty bits. That, or they were so lean that it tasted like it was fried so many times that it was (literally) hard to eat. I almost couldn't even bite into some of the pieces. The egg was also a little TOO fried for my taste. It was almost as if they cracked an egg directly into the fryer. Despite all this, the sauce they used for the pork was pretty good. Too bad, the pork itself wasn't that good. Tip - all lunch specials come with your choice of papaya salad, chicken larb, or soda. I opted for the chicken larb. The flavor was good - nice and limey, but not overly limey. However, the ground chicken they used was dry. And if the ground chicken was dry, I don't think I want to know how all their other chicken tastes like.	2star
Local Bar, nice window seat and inside is relaxed restaurant table space.  The bartender is okay friendly, more of relaxed bar with mid 30s main costumers.  I prefer this kind of bar less noisy not too loud but still not too quiet.  Located off the main street so that is plus too.  The pricing for drinks here is set in very friendly range I think.  If living in this area, it is a nice casual spot to come at night.	3star
I found this place just odd while the food was bad. I read the positive reviews hoping for a stellar time. Really dark ambience that I assume is somehow supposed to lend to a balmy/cozy night depending on the season, however I just found it oppressive. The food was outright confusing with poor quality ingredients. I eat out at incredible restaurants - because in nyc we are lucky to be near them! and Traif shouldn't have the glowing reviews.  EVERY dish was either under salted or way way over salted. I started with the foie gras thinking me and my boyfriend couldn't go wrong and it was sugary sweet with balancing acid at all. Why would you do that to foie gras?!?  The ribs were also syrupy like others have pointed out. Lots of ingredients were recycled over and over like a corn salad that put over two of the dishes we happened to order. This restaurant feels like a borderline scam and wish I could have contested our expensive bill but one can't do that just because they felt they were ripped off, right?  Traif is right down the street so I'm sorry that I won't be returning. Weird dinner.	1star
I've heard about Basta Pasta for a while now, just never had the chance to go until this week. I was really excited to get the pasta tossed in the wheel of parmesan cheese because if there's anything I love in this world, it's cheese (and coffee).  We ordered an appetizer, 3 pastas and a second dish - grilled chicken breast. All in all, they tasted good but were underwhelming. The portions are really small for the price. That's the main reason why I probably won't return. Food tastes good but not good enough for the price.	3star
I work a few blocks from Ora and my two first meals there were very good.  I had high hopes for them.  Went there tonight and it seems the place has really gone down hill.  Totally incompetent waiter, 2 out of 3 regular beers out of stock.  I ordered the Tortlini in Brodo and it was inedible.....just horrid.  Won't be going back.	2star
Horrible service!! Didn't have what I wanted! Horrible experience , never coming back. A restaurant is supposed to have everything that they have on their menu.	1star
A bit off the beaten path but very close to the high line, this is a solid Chelsea brunch spot. Came here on a Saturday morning for brunch and the atmosphere was pretty lively: not too long of a wait but all the tables were full. The atmosphere and service were both above average. Our starters were the highlight of the meal while our mains were good but not exemplary. Didn't have any cocktails but they did look good (esp Bloody Mary). Starters: Beignets with blueberry jam: really fluffy and light, blueberry flavor was a nice addition Candied bacon scone with maple butter: if your a bacon person (idk why you wouldn't be) this is a must. Definitely the best thing we had here Mains: Oven baked sunny side up eggs with panchetta and raisin toast: uncomplicated but tasty, not sure of the pairing of the hearty dish with sweet raisin toast though Poached eggs: nothing new here but still very good	4star
Love this place. Celebrated my husband's birthday here last night and it was perfect. John (the owner) and the bartender (didn't get his name) were so helpful and friendly. Comfortable and beautiful decor. So happy it opened up close to my apt. Can't wait to go back.	5star
I couldn't wait to try this place after all of the positive reviews, but I have to say that I was left quite disappointed.  Having tried numerous Italian restaurants in NYC, I can honestly say this was one of my worst experiences.  The chicken parm was underwhelming and while edible was nothing to write home about.  The pizza was better than the chicken parm, but was by no means a reason to return to a place that often has a ridiculously long wait.  I did like the thin crust, but it wasn't really so outstanding that it warrants all of these 4-5 star reviews.  With so many incredible Italian restaurants and amazing pizza in NYC and Little Italy, I wouldn't waste my time on this one.	2star
Pretty solid Japanese joint for a quick snack. DokoDemo reminds me of my travels in Osaka where every corner I turn is a vendor selling Takoyaki, Yakisoba or Okonomiyaki. All dishes were made to order, guaranteeing that everything is served steaming hot, just like they should be! I opted for the takoyaki, yakisoba and matcha chips, and they did not disappoint! The matcha chips were amazing and addicting; if not for portion control, I think I would be munching on these all day. The yakisoba was a tad salty & oily for me but nonetheless delicious!  Grilled food such as these pairs perfectly with iced cold oolong tea or green tea, which they offer!	4star
Was really hungry for a delicious lobster roll but they didn't open on time and I just ended up giving up and going to Shake Shack across the street :(	1star
Complete disappointment! We went there yesterday for dinner. I love Cuban food!  Waiter was uninterested in refilling our water. Food from the Prefix meal took an hour between the app and main course. My husband doesn't like to complain other wise I would have spoken to the Manager/owner or any else with sense in the place. They ran out of the plantains and yuca for our order and we watched them come into the restaurant with a bag 45 mins after our food should have come out. 15 mins later we have over cooked drum sticks for the baked chicken meal ... really drum sticks! Yuck super disappointed. I only gave 2 stars because my husband did like his Cuban sandwich.	2star
Good things: service, sangria and carnitas Ehh: chicken, salad , overall flavores and menu choices I love Peruvian food, however I did not enjoy this place as much as I enjoyed others. It is a bit pricey for the food. The chicken that I had as an entree was fatty. Overall it was alright. My friend liked it a bit more than I have. If I'm in the mood for Peruvian I rather go somewhere else.	3star
$16 for 6 shrimps? Are you guys serving some world class shrimp cocktail? Crappy waitress service. Bitchy attitudes shown by both owner and the waiter. Apparently trying to make a block sign for a check by grabbing someone's attention is considered as rude.	1star
Amazing soup dumplings!! Well balanced flavors and addictive. We ordered 4 sets of 6 and scallion pancakes. It was all delicious including the fried rice.	5star
"I went here on a Friday for my going away. When I arrived I was told that I needed to have my party with me. I didn't have a reservation, the place was empty so I didn't think I needed one. I waited outside till my coworker came for like 30mins then went back inside. The hostess then tells me after we order our drinks that the table she is going to give us is reserved and that the whole place is reserved and we have 1hr to eat and get drinks. ( I kept thinking, why didn't she tell me this when I first came, I would have went somewhere else). The hostess then became our waiter too, I ordered the white sangria and she kept bringing me lychee martini's, so I had to keep sending them back. So out of our ""hour"" that we we're allotted to sit, I got one drink. The place seems disorganized, maybe because it was a Friday. I would probably come back because the atmosphere was nice and the drinks and food were good but I probably wouldn't come on Friday- Sunday."	3star
Meh I've experience better sums it up.   We went on Saturday afternoon at around 2pm.   I got a meat and two sides, with fried shrimps as the meat, and home fries and collards.  Only the collards were good.  The potatoes and shrimps were both dry and lukewarm, like they'd been fried 15-30 mins earlier and kept warmish since then.  Which at $25 for the plate is poor.   Service was pleasant and fast, and very helpful to the one guy who needed to leave early (fetching his food first).  So a star for that.  But I wouldn't go back.	2star
Ok first of all, I feel like I am the most low maintenance customer you can get. I don't ask questions, don't expect over and above service by any means, I'm not picky, and I feel like I am very understanding. Still... my friend and I walked in and tried to look for a menu, since no one was waiting at the door to guide us in or hand us one. Finally the host motioned to us with a blank stare after we paced back and forth confused. He barely said anything to us and just stood there. We sat ourselves inside and considering leaving because of the really confusing service we had just received, but decided to stay because we were hungry. I ordered the miso salmon bowl and my friend ordered a burger medium rare. I had hoped the food was good enough to make up for the lack of service, especially considering the higher prices. And I was surprised yet again!! HAH my salmon bowl actually has me feeling sick right now; the rice had to be a few days old or severely undercooked, salmon was poke style but really soggy and tasted old as well. My friend's burger was ordered medium rare but came out well done. Despite this we finished our food because we didn't want to make a fuss, paid the check, and even left a respectable tip. But this place was terrrrrrible. I mean by all means go try it for all the hype that this place seems to get but it is NOT worth a waste of your time, money, or patience.	1star
Definitely found it wasn't worthy of it's strong 4-star rating. Walked into an empty place minus one drunk, loud table. Burgers were very forgettable, service was meh, house drinks were not finished. Overall nothing special.	2star
"I would have preferred to not write a negative review, but, sorry, in this case Daniel restaurant could not care less about my experience and I'm very disappointed. Maybe it's because I'm a native NY'er, maybe it's because I don't speak French even after 7 years of study.  We showed up without a reservation the other evening, enjoyed cocktails at the bar, and mentioned that if a table became available in the ""dining room,"" we'd love to celebrate my ""birthday"" at Daniel.  We were offered the lounge.  I have dined at Daniel in the ""restaurant"" various times previously and was hesitant to sit in the lounge.  We asked about the menu and I told the m'aitre de  I would never sit ""upstairs"" for a price fixed  menu...the room is just too casual.  He assured us that though it's the same menu, we could order ""a la carte."" We figured for a couple of courses with our drinks, why not.  We were seated in the lounge and had the lovely experience of watching waiters  running around the table of 10 guests seated next to us. Not an intimate experience, not a relaxing experience, most certainly not for a Birthday. The a la carte menu is ridiculously priced.  Though the The 7 course meal is $225 and the 4 course is $151,  We were charged $82 not including tax or tip for that same ""2 inch"" piece of beef a la carte.  Other than the $35 tiny portion of gnocchi, all the other items on the a la carte menu were priced over $60.  Yes, all these items are 2 ounces of food. The desserts are $24. Clearly because of the price points, the lounge is not for a la carte dining. Btw: out entrees were brought out while I was in the ladies room. That 2 inch $82 piece of beef was served cold.  We spent over $400 and my husband was starving. Btw: the bread is GREAT!!! And the food is quite good (other than my dessert) BUT, How desperate is Daniel for diners that they'd push us to the lounge when I clearly stated I would not do a price fixe menu in the lounge because I don't consider the lounge a place for a fine dining experience!!! When I called the manager, his response to me, was that next time I should make a reservation.  Yes, I was punished because I didn't make a reservation. Shame on you, Daniel."	2star
I forget where I read a write-up of this place but it's in my 'hood so I wanted to try it out. Came here on a Friday night and it was decently full considering this place just opened a week or so ago. Ambiance is clean and airy like another reviewer noted but the design is skewed feminine. A beauty parlour feel to it. The service is friendly but diner-esque. There were 3 servers who were also responsible for making drinks, seating, and bussing tables. So when I needed something, my waitress wasn't around and the other waitress was too busy as well. As for food, my red snapper tasted great but it was sooo spicy. I asked for medium spicy but pretty sure it qualifies as very spicy (and I'm not a pansy when it comes to spicy). One thing about the food that's strange to me is that the rice comes wrapped in saran wrap. My fiance's rice with his chicken dish came that way and so did the rice in my mango sticky rice. Sort of annoying to have to unwrap your rice. On top of that, my mango came with the skin on it so I had to slice off the mango pieces myself! Grrr! I hate working for my food when I don't think I should have to! I know that's a weird thing to complain about but I've ordered mango sticky rice from almost a dozen thai places and this is the first time that the mango came with its skin.  BTW, not sure when they'll get their liquor license but, in the meantime, the place is NOT BYOB.	3star
They opened just in time for winter.  Food is consistent with their original chinatown locations.  The UES location is of course new and so far sparking clean.  Hopefully they keep that up.  I think the prices are a tad higher as expected.  It is still very much affordable considering the location. My favorite is the tiger salad - pretty much celery and cilantro salad.  Good to balance the numbing sensation from the spices. The cold fried noodles - it's not cold, it's pan fried noodles.  My husband said it is not the handmade pulled noodles but I like the thinner texture more.	4star
"This place has the makings of something good, but unfortunately we had a very poor experience this past Sunday.  There were 4 of us and arrived for dinner at about 6:00 and sat outside. The restaurant is beautiful and quite large. At the time, majority of guests were outside because the weather was amazing, so very few patrons sat inside. To sum that up - it wasn't very busy. We received water from a busboy, and then proceeded to wait 10 minutes with no server ever coming to our table. We asked the busboy to send the server over at this point. The server arrived a few minutes later and we placed our full order as we had enough time to review everything. 10 minutes goes by and our cheese appetizer came out, but our wines were nowhere to be seen. We pulled someone aside who worked there and asked if our wines would be coming soon so we can enjoy with our cheese - about 5 minutes later they arrived, being served by someone who I assume was the sommelier. This was now 30 minutes into our time here and just having received our wine. The cheese was delicious and we enjoyed the wine. Then, 30 minutes goes by and the server comes over to say our food would be out in 5 minutes. In this interaction, we asked for another wine as we wait. 15 or so more minutes goes by and we had yet to receive our food, OR the wine. My husband pulled our server aside and asked if there was a problem in the kitchen as it is now 7:30 and we have not received our entree. Also, where is our wine?  The server's response was that he checked on the kitchen and he is not sure and will check again - and the wine is coming. The problem is, guests behind us sat down after us and were already done eating their entree! It is not acceptable to operate at this slow speed. 10 more minutes go by and we finally receive our entrees at 7:40pm. We sat down at 6:00pm - this is an absurd amount of time. We didn't order anything obscure - we ordered 1 chicken entree, 2 ravioli entrees, and a salad.  I wondered what the issue was, and then I realized... I noticed the server bring a complimentary drink over to the table next to us, and as he placed it down he said ""I am sorry, this is on me as I forgot to put it in earlier."" This server had forgotten their drink order, so I can only assume he had forgotten every single part of our order as well. Otherwise, I have no idea why we would have to wait almost 2 hours to eat.  We would have gotten up and walked out before our entree arrived, and the only reason we did not is because we were entertaining guests from another country. I am very disappointed with this experience and feel bad for restaurant management, because simple things like not making patrons wait and wait, especially when the restaurant isn't busy, should be ironed out in a dining experience.  The food was good, so this is a clear miss."	1star
The food was ok. I got the vermicelli bowl, they gave only two small scoops which wasn't enough. I topped it off with chicken and all the other veggies. The chicken was burnt and dry. Don't get this guys! Trust me! The veggies was just ok, nothing special. I had the garlic sauce added on top along with baba which is like a white sauce with rice grain inside I believe, I asked the lady there that was serving me and she just said it taste sour so I said yes. However she didn't tell me it cost extra $1.5 or so. Don't remember. But the total was like $13 which I don't think is worth it given the quality and the taste of the food. The baba was def too sour and didn't taste good with the combination of the food. The hummus on the other hand was pretty decent.  Overall - given all the options out there for that price, I don't remember this place. I love to venture out and try new things but this is def a no return for me. Not my cup of tea but could be yours. Try it and see for yourself but don't say I didn't warn ya lol	2star
"This is a review for Mister Sunday at Nowadays.  I have not been to Nowadays on any other occasion, so cannot speak to what it's like at other times... As you can see, I rated this poorly.  I'm giving it two stars for the space and the concept; both of which I think are great.  My experience with Mister Sunday began at the gate; where the extremely serious and cranky security guard lady searched through mine and my friend's bags like President Obama or the Pope was in the house...like every nook and cranny, Geez!  It was kind of a mood kill for us two girls who were just looking to day drink, dance, and have a good time.  Then there was the $20 entrance fee.  For $20 this better be one hell of a party with some decent drink deals/entertainment at very least...nope!  So, we walk in and I'm taken back by how square the crowd seems and how everyone is just huddled in their corners with the people they came with, having quiet conversation. It read to me like a wannabe Bushwick crowd...rich kids, dressed all cool cause they're spending a Sunday in a ""hip"" neighborhood.  I know I'm being a bit critical, and to be fair people seemed nice enough.  The drink prices were around $8-10, pretty standard, but not particularly strong.  The food, however, was super overpriced for what you get.  They're totally cashing in on the fact that day drinkers have to eat and there's no good food establishments around unless you want to leave the party and take a long walk to find them.  Then there's the MUSIC...This was the biggest disappointment of all.  So, it's house music - very basic, very repetitive house music...each song sounding exactly like the last. People did get up and dance and that was fun to watch, but I think this is great music to dance to if you're a bad dancer or you have no rhythm.  I'll admit, I'm not the biggest fan of house music to begin with, but I was really shocked by the monotony of the tracks.  Since I heard this was a dance party, I was expecting some old school hip-hop or funk at very least - but I was wrong.   Overall, I felt like it was a really hyped-up, but disappointingly lame experience...especially for the price.  I like that the party was all ages and Nowadays is a great outdoor venue.  It's just the Mister Sunday party that came up short, or just didn't meet my expectations.  I don't think it's as cool as it's made out to be.  There, I said it!"	2star
Solid fried chicken. I got the chicken and waffles and my friend got the chicken in a box. The biscuit is great, though I wish they gave normal butter rather than this whipped sweet butter. I didn't find the waffle appetizing, but really enjoyed the chicken. Pass on the chicken and waffles in the future, and get the chicken in a box with gravy!	4star
After foregoing this place for a few of the surrounding brunch choices, I finally braved the cold to see what the wait was all about.  We were quoted 30 minutes and were able to leave a phone number for text notification.  However, we never received one.  We walked in to find that most of the others who had jotted their names down at the same time were already seated. My short rib hash dish contained chunks of extremely DRY meat.  Sticking with sunny-side-up eggs offered a nice coating & extra moisture, but it wasn't enough to overcome how harsh the meat was.  My mom had ordered the same dish.  A quick study of the two plates revealed an inconsistency between the two.  She had much less short rib hash and I had only a few cubed potatoes.  While waiting to use the restroom, I was in the direct line of kitchen items being sent out; I noticed the short rib hash plating varied greatly.  Consistent & proper portioning was problematic for them. I left feeling very underwhelmed.  The hype surrounding the short rib hash was unjustified.  The rest of the plate didn't succeed either: the multi-grain toast triangles were hard as heck, & the presentation looked sloppy, amateurish and thoughtless.  Based on these factors, I would venture elsewhere if there was any amount of wait time involved.	3star
Was here with one other for a short meal. He had the pork belly while I had the sisig. Pork belly had an interesting sauce, kind of like kare kare but not as peanuty. Pork belly was good. Sisig was excellent. Though I wish instead of having a super hot lime on the plate, they gave calimansi juice instead. I asked about getting some as well that would be my preference and the guy basically pointed at the lime (lolok.) Pretty large plate though, much more than the pork belly for 4/5 more. Coconut rice was excellent.	4star
the women in charge of reservations are disrespectful and should most definitely be taught how to communicate with customers. terrible way to brand a business. would not recommend. save yourself the disappointment.	1star
My friend and I stopped in for lunch while biking around Brooklyn. We negotiated sharing a few items and were very happy. The macaroni and cheese is not to be missed, probably one of my favorites! The mac and cheese at Hill Country comes in a close second. We split a pulled pork sandwich, corn bread and a sausage link. All very good and there are other menu options I look forward to trying.  We came here at an off-peak time on a Sunday in late fall so there was a minimal wait and seating was generally open.	4star
Delicious healthy brunch food in the heart of Soho Came here on Sunday for a sister's brunch date at 10:30AM. We were told it would be a 45 minute wait, so we walked around Soho as we waited. A little heads up, they don't call you when your table is up so be mindful when you put your name down with the hostess who is often running around.  We were seated around 11:30AM. The menu has something for everyone whether you were craving a healthy grain bowl or a cheesy toast or you have a sweet tooth for waffles.  MADAME FREDA $16: Probably the most perfectly sunnyside egg I have ever seen! As you cut into it, the egg yolk still oozes over the cheesy toast with a hint of saltiness from the duck prosciutto. But I was not entirely impressed since the cheese had hardened by the time it reached me. And the toast was quite hard. The arugala with pickled onion on the side was quite sad, as the pickled onions did not taste like anything.  BREAKFAST BOWL $16: Hearty quinoa bowl with kale and grilled tomato. You won't be missong anything as the grilled tomatoes added a great flavor with the creaminess of the avocado and poached egg. They had this amazing house made green hot sauce that paired perfectly well with the grain bowl. Highly recommended for those trying to fuel up for their Soho shopping.  DUCK BACON $6: A much thicker and less fatty bacon. Great bacon, not over crispy. For me, it was too oily as it was sitting in a pool of oil. I would skip this. NANA TEA $4.50: Hot minty tea that is very refreshing, recommended with honey! (Ask the waiters for it). I was surprised by how much I love that minty taste as I often like my tea weak. This was a great wakeup call. And if you finish, ask for more hot water! CANTALOUPE JUICE $6: AMAZING AND MUST GET! Ok I must admit that at first I was quite skeptical since many brunch places often have freshly squeezed orange and grapefruit juices, but now I am all for a freshly squeezed cantaloupe juice! It was not overly sweet and quite refreshing! SERVICE: I want to give a huge shout out to our waitress, Abigail! Even though she had big tables, she checked up on us constantly. Another waiter actually took our order, but his goofy side got the best of him as he completely messed up our order. When he repeated back our order, he added items and then laughed it off, but reassured us that he got it. Something felt a bit off and Abigail came to the rescue and save our brunch date! Everyone was super friendly and even though the restaurant was bustling especially on Sunday for brunch, you never felt rushed.  I would probably come back for brunch, even on a Sunday, to try the other items on their menu as well as get my fixing of cantaloupe juice! If you do come on Sunday, at around 12PM, the wait is about an hour to an hour and 15 minutes. So, if you can, get there before and your wait should be about 45minutes. Not a bad wait for a healthy brunch in New York City!	4star
yes food came out in less than five minutes, yes the poached eggs were perfectly cooked and presented.....but the rest.....the  reheated precooked potatoes had a dry, rubbery skin and a mushy inside with the flavor of the day before, yes dog food. the reheated, overcooked, shrinked, merguez sausages were so dry that you could have smoked them as cigars. the salad passable. the bloody mary as bloody as ever. the service good. and yes $30  for 2 good eggs and a bleeding mary, will get u 2 lucky stars if u consider the tiny impertinent roach staring at me from the green counter	2star
This place continues not to disappoint. Best spaghetti I've ever had. Hands down. Also the best bread basket with various sauces. They will give you more if you ask. I also recently ventured outside the standard Italian apps and ordered the yellow tail. It was great!! I would 100% get this again. It was very fresh.	5star

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME.  FUCK THIS PLACE .... IF I COUKD GIVE NEGATIVESTARS I WOULD...I was a party of 5 and ppl that was sat after me with bigger or smaller parties in my section we ordered simple food and sat 1hr for nothing no one came over no refill the water or any of the drinks ... when the rude ass manager came over he had no answer on why we was waiting over an hour for fish and chips chicken fingers and french fries lobster tails and shrimp... like no answer he tried to say the smaller parties are smaller than us ... that wasn't exceptable... when we asked for his boss NO ONE WAS TRYING TO MAKE ACCOMMODATIOS ... I understand it's father's day but Jesus Christ we didn't order anything special... I will never ever the fuck again come here ever... the rude manager and his boss need help with satisfying customers...  DO NOT WASTE THE TIME TO COME HERE...	1star
A neighborhood bar that I walk past all of the time, always linger upon the menu, but never go in. A friend has been raving about this place for a while now....chicken curry chicken curry chicken curry...to the point I think I hear it chanting in my sleep. FINALLY, we went for happy hour last night.  Fishmarket is def a hidden gem with a grungy looking bar exterior. However, tucked inside is not just a seafood barfood type of place, but also a solid Malaysian menu held down by the owner's very lovable mom. Top it off with the friendliest service and easy going patrons, you're guaranteed a solid good time. At one point (many points, actually), shots of Jameson were passed around by the owner. Yup, that kind of night.  On to the food: Crispy chicken fried rice Chicken Curry Fried chicken wings Yummy noodles Pork belly Fish tacos *All very good, but the standout dish for me is the crispy fried rice. Biting into  those lil morsels of rice crispies and fried shallots make me wanna do the Carlton.	4star
There was a worm in my macaroni and cheese. (P.s. I found out while I was half way done.)	1star
Inefficient layout leads to a crowded bar where you are presented with a menu full of mediocre cocktails. The bartender will make you a surprisingly bad version of your favorite drink and you will be disappointed. The pretentious clientele will most likely push and shove you out of the way forcing you to spill your drink on yourself. If you're lucky, the owner might yell at you as well.  You will be disappointed. Go somewhere else.	2star
David Chang: Marry me. I have been dying to try any of the momofuku restaurants and I'm embarrassed to say I haven't even been to the noodle bar even though I pride myself on being a ramen expert. A disgrace...I know.  Anyway, my two friends and I decided to try ssam bar on a Friday night knowing that we would have to wait quite a while for a table. We were quoted an hour- walked across the street for a beer- and in exactly an hour we were texted that a table was opening up for us.  Because we were already tipsy from the pregaming we had done we skipped drinks and  went straight for food. Ordered the pork buns and Brussels sprouts to start. That little sweet pork bun was the tastiest thing I've eaten in 2015- maybe even in 2014. I never wanted it to end. And it did in 2 bites because I devoured that thing. The Brussels sprouts were crispy and salty and those are the best adjectives I could ever use to describe food. For the main my friend and I split the ribeye. We were told it could feed 4-6 and we happily ordered it for 2. See picture below. Medium rare with cloves of garlic and onions thank god I wasn't on a date. Served with a side of siZZLING LARd and salt. I mean hi David Chang are you my soulmate? I now have a bone in my fridge. Best part of falling asleep tonight will be waking up to that bone.  Topped the night off at milk with crack pie. I can't even.	5star
"There's nothing like a fun weekday spent nibbling around Brooklyn, unless it's a day spent WHILE you're playing hooky from work (Sorry, Bossman). ""Lamb tibs! You'll get your lamb tibs today"", I exclaimed to my coworker during the ride in. We scour the oh-so-painfully hipster gentrifying area for parking. We walk in. Cool decor with hints of the building's past functions -- pipes, wood panels, and interesting architecture about. We're calmly lead to a small table in the corner. Plop down, look at the menu and......Ruh--OHHHHHH. I forgot, Bunna is vegan. Whoops! No problem for me, however my meat happy-lamb-tibs-craving partner in crime looked a bit disappointed...especially after I hyped up the craving 15 minute prior. I assured him all would be okay, that yelp REALLY does love this sweet, trendy little spot and that we'll both be herbivores for lunch. Ordered a platter, It was sort of like a rainbow of colors atop the spongy injera. We picked our way around, sampling the little dollops of vegetables and staining the skin under our nails with the red, green, yellow as we went. I loved the beets, Kale was a little vinegary, tomatoes were a bit atypical (almost pico di gallo like? meh) and there were at least two diff types of lentils, if I remember correctly. Something was spicy, I couldn't tell you what it was (maybe the lentils, this is a reach since I'm writing this 2mos. later), but it was delightful. I didn't like everything on my plate, but that's the beauty of getting a platter.  I've eaten a lot of Ethiopian but I couldn't tell you if Bunna is traditional or just mixes the flavors and spices, matching it with selections more appetizing to the Brooklyn taste and style. I almost always shoot for the veggi platters in Ethiopian restaurants, and their style was a touch different than what I was used to.  Either way, the spiced coffee from the decorative clay pot and the Shai (Chai) tea were both pleasant ends to our meal. The price of the aforementioned platter was completely inoffensive -- $15 for a feast for deux plus drinks. Nice.  I even saw our waitress at Smorgasburg 2 weeks later. One cup of Shai (pretty please with spices on top)... !  Cash Only."	3star
the cubano was great. I wasn't a fan of the tamales at all.  too dry. The yucca was great but the inedible threads were left on there and you had to use your hands to pull it out. More importantly, what is UP with a waiter asking me point blank how much tip i should add on my credit card before he runs it?  Umm no thank you, you do NOT ask that. And the server sucked. I had to waive him over a few times, and we had completed our meal for well over 5 minutes and he was standing less than 10 feet away leaning on the wall looking dazed and confused.  I had to stand up and literally walk over to ask him if we could please pay.  He must get shafted out of tips often he sucks so bad.  That took the stars away - front of house is IMPORTANT.  I'm glad i didn't get the endless drink special. I probably would have only received one glass.	3star
Cheap brunch in a quaint cafe. Came around 1pm on a Sunday and just beat the rush. Don't go with more than one other person - this place is pretty tiny so smaller parties will get seated faster. The brunch menu is...pretty much all eggs: I got an egg white omelet and BF got the eggs benedict. You also get your choice of a mimosa, sangria or coffee with your brunch order. Food came out pretty quickly and everything tasted great (although these are pretty standard breakfast dishes so it wasn't really a surprise). Good price for a solid breakfast but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.	3star
"When my boyfriend met me, he said ""Great, it's the Chi-Chi's of New York. "" He wasn't far off.  The space is lovely, especially for nice weather, since it is open on two sides, but that was about it.  We came and was served their Happy Hour menu and the prices were shocking. Their Happy Hour specials are small Margaritas for $8 and $9 - not exactly special.  We ordered chicken enchiladas ($17) and it was a dishI could have made better myself. I would describe the dish as boiled chicken with no seasoning inside a corn tortilla, piled high with iceberg lettuce.  Service was extremely slow. Completely understaffed - it took at least 15 minutes to get a drink. I had to get up twice to ask for things.  Our bill came to almost $90 for 3 margaritas, chips/guac and two chicken enchilada entrees.  I would say, reasonably the meal was worth $50 tops. Too high for the East Village. I've had tastier Mexican cart food. If you go here, just know that they must pay exorbitant rent for that nice corner space - and, in turn, you will be paying for it."	2star
"I have signed up for yelp specifically to write about the horrific experience my party and I had last night. Our encounter with ""part-owner"" Jose, was a nightmare, just because we politely approached him about some blatantly false advertising. Please read a longer version below.  Furthermore, it's Harlem, it's cramped, There are very few redeeming qualities to this place.  We made New Year's Eve plans to spend the evening at a bar which was offering a deal where you spent $35 for unlimited drinks and a free champagne toast at midnight. We heard of this location through a friend who was working the event and we researched the event online.Nowhere on any of the advertisements were there any time restraints or fine print restrictions. My party and I arrived at the bar at 11:00 PM, when we asked to pay the $35 we were all told ""No."" By a bartender who offered no other explanation. When prompted for a clearer explanation, the bartender explained to me, ""that would be silly, it's almost midnight it won't be worth the money.""  For a place that charges minimum $9 per drink, he was completely wrong, however he would not budge, and in that hour, most of the members of my party had purchased more than $40 worth of drinks.At midnight, it appeared that nobody received their complimentary toast until after midnight and only after begging a different bartender, Jose. One member of my party asked for her complimentary toast and was told simply ""No,"" again, being left to pay nearly $10 for a glass of cheap champagne that was supposed to be free.  I approached Jose to then ask for my complimentary toast and received an identical response. Feeling frustrated,  I politely asked him why the change of heart? He responded by telling me that the toast was only for people who had paid $35 for unlimited drinks. Not only is this not advertised anywhere, it also makes the toast just part of your unlimited drink deal, not complimentary.  We were also not allowed to purchase the deal! I pointed out the obvious to Jose in the advertisement he had widely displayed all over this establishment, and told him that this was really poor business practice. I was met with a rude display of entitled behavior when Jose said ""so!? What are you going to do? I'm part owner!!"" He directed me to read the ""actual"" ad for the party hung up in the bathroom, still without any type of fine print. Pics available."	1star
This place is maybe trying to be the Poke of Korean food but I found the choices very limited and lacking. We shared a bowl with purple rice (a mix of black and purple) and the base was bland, and you get 2 entrees, no toppings. We got roasted veggies (which were heavy on the potato which is not a real vegetable, and onions, which is nice but also doesn't really count), and the fish balls and rice cake (which was very sparing on the fish). Basically we had some rice and potatoes and rice cake which is a lot of carbs and filled us up but wasn't that interesting. The decor is very cafe and clean and the service is friendly.	2star
Ordered plantain with mushrooms, steak lollipops, and tacos. All were very delicious. Server was very attentive. Glad to have this place in Sunnyside.	5star
"Peaches not Peachy Food Vs Service. ""The Peaches way"" I was torn on this one. Please don't think I'm unrealistic about busy restaurant. Busy wasn't the issue, the waiter saying ""there are other people in the restaurant still eating"" after one person in the party gets their food 35 minutes after everyone else. This was a hard review because the Shrimp Po Boy, Brooklyn Wings and Salmon were stars on a menu balanced with Soul Food hits and all American favorites.   This neighborhood restaurant has the food we all liked growing up  but felt like a second class citizen today in a place I grew up.  The manager comped the dinner for the two ladies at our table but dinner be ware maybe we should have called the manager when the waiter took the order a second time."	1star
I guess My expectation was too high. I ordered kale salad from special menu, octopus and the steak. Kale salad was good, nothing special. The octopus was okay. Too many potatoes. And the steak!! When i saw the picture of the steak, My expectation went up really high. But the sauce was salty and the steak was little bit hard to chew.	3star
Sorry for this review.  It's purpose is to get the owners attention.  I really like this place.  I only come here for the Xiao Long Bao which are awesome!  So flavorful and just the right size and texture.  HOWEVER, the recently took the soup dumplings OFF THE MENU!! WHY!!???? The place is called THE BAO, as in XIAO LONG BAO!  It even says (maybe not anymore) on their napkins Xiao Long Bao.  WHY? WHY? WHY did you take it off the menu?  Please put it back on the menu.	1star
This place is darn good. Though I have to point out the prices are too high for the frequency I wish I could consume their Lobster Rolls, especially compared to CT, RI or ME pricing. Anyway, I haven't had a bad item on the menu here, and I'm always happy to go. Service is friendly, fast, and the food has always been fresh and tasty. It does help to get a reservation if you're going with more than 2 people for dinner because there's not a lot of seating - and they do take them unlike many trendy places in the area - so you should plan accordingly if you're not from the neighborhood... because, let's face it, Red Hook is not the easiest place to get to for most New Yorkers. If you haven't had their Lobstah roll, you're missing out. Go get one warm with butter, the way it's meant to be.	4star
I was really excited to try this place but unfortunately I didn't like it. Maybe I ordered wrong or maybe I came on the wrong day, I don't know. I came here with my dad tonight and we got the fried chicken, the burger, and a side of plaintains.  First of all, the prices surprised me. $22 for fried chicken and French fries? It was a big portion but still.... also, it was extreeeemely hot; I could barely eat it. Not spicy, hot. The French fries were soggy, too. The chicken was just pretty flavorless.  The burger wasn't any better. The meat was too thick, and the bun was dry and soggy. It was not good at all, unfortunately. It also came with soggy fries.  The plaintains were the only good thing here. Also, suuuuper loud music! I could barely hear anything.	2star
"Not sure why this place has 4 stars unless it's because of the affordable happy hour price... I went for a birthday dinner on a whim with my boyfriend since we were in the area, and I had really high expectations for their Thursday night Brazilian specials, but was far from impressed. The ""Brazilian"" ribs were ordered as appetizers did not taste good at all and were served with chimichurri which is not Brazilian.  For entrees we got the moqueca and steak. The steak and yuca fries tasted good (again served with a ton of chimichurri), and the flavor of the moqueca was decent, but the ""fish"" did not look or taste like fish-- it was some strange fish-sausage looking thing that grossed me out and I couldn't bring myself to eat. Looked very artificial even in the dim lighting."	3star
DO NOT GO HERE! I live in the area so my friend from China and I decided to get some dim sum here instead of Chinatown. We saw that there was a happy hour on dim sum at 3PM so we walked in at 2:54pm. The food was not that authentic and tasted as if it was from the day before. They did not honor the happy hour prices because of 6 minutes. Food is not good so just go to Chinatown or Flushing instead	1star
Ate here Thursday night. Friday night all the way through all of Saturday I thought I may have gotten stomach flu or food poisoning. The friend that I ate with there, got the same thing and also couldn't move and had flu like symptoms. Coincidence???	1star
I REALLY wanted to like Vanessa's Dumplings. This place is CRAZY cheap, which is always my kinda deal. Plus, literally all of my Yelp friends here have also come here and posted mostly rave reviews. I was anticipating meaty, savory dumplings with rich flavor. I'm sorry to say that I wasn't too impressed. First of all, this place is IMPOSSIBLE TO GRAB A SEAT. Unless you go literally at the second they open their doors, you are not gettin' a seat buddy. Take it to go and eat on the run LOL. You are literally on a very long line waiting just to give your order. The line went out the door today when I went. So that took a good 15 minutes just for me to get to the register to give my order. You pay first and then you are given a number on your receipt, with which you need to wait to be called on that number. I ordered the famed fried pork dumplings, and an egg and chive pancake. The wait for my food thankfully wasn't too long, it came within 3 minutes.  On the outside, the fried dumplings look delectable. However, looks can be deceiving and these dumplings definitely lied to me. The dumplings as it turns out are like 70% dough!! There's only a tiny thing of meat inside, sooo sad. No wonder why they can afford to offer them so cheap. I seriously could have just walked over next door to any of the number of Chinese supermarkets, bought a bag of frozen dumplings and fried them myself at home that's how disappointed I am! I am Chinese, and I know good Chinese food. Vanessa's Dumplings I feel caters to the poor college student and the inebriated, basically people who are too high and/or too wasted to care if they're eating good Chinese food LOL. I also got the egg and chive pancake, which thankfully was a much better bang for my buck. They actually decently stuffed the pancake with a good amount of scrambled egg & chives, and it was really good. Overall though, I know I can get much meatier dumplings pretty much anywhere else in Chinatown including Prosperity which is Vanessa's main competition. There's also Great NY Noodle Town, and my personal favorite Vegetarian Dim Sum House. The only reason I think I would return to Vanessa's is if I'm down to my last like 5 dollars LOL.	3star
OMG. This place is amazing. Definitely come with a group of people so you can try a bunch of things on the menu. I don't have specific recommendations - just get everything. All the dishes are made with just the right balance of delicious and exotic flavors. A must get is the pork buns - they sit on a pillowy cloud of a bun - it's heaven in your mouth!	5star
Solid brunch spot. This place gets superrrr busy and I can see why. The host and staff were pleasant and just the right amount of attentiveness.  Lets just start off by saying that the Bloody Mary's here are delish! Really tasty and the perfect amount of kick to wake you up from that hangover.  The artic char shared plate is a must order! I love that you combine is with creme fraiche, topped with picked red onion . If you're a fan of gingerbread then go for the gb pancakes. I wasnt but tried them anyways. The ginger really shines. The sunny side up baked eggs was nothing to rave about but was cooked well.  Slightly pricey but then again, youre in Chelsea. I'd return.	4star
"I literally just walked out from dinner spending $91 on some watered down tasting seafood (granted I also ordered 2 apps and 2 beers). And I also happened to drain a crab claw for a good minute because there was so much water in it that ultimately watered down everything!! Only reason why this review is getting 2 stars is because of the excellent service (restaurant was half empty during Friday dinner service). I guess for the price, you get what you get. After dining at The Boil in Chinatown and The Boiling Crab in Los Angeles this can never compare. We ordered 2 combos of the 1 pound snow crab and shrimp (5-7 pieces of large shrimps) for $28 which came with 2 pieces of corn and potatoes. It is definitely cheaper than the more well known spots but of course the shrimp and crab here were previously frozen. When it came time to peeling the crab, half the meat would rip off with the skin.  And the sauce? You're only allowed one sauce per each combo because they put the 2 seafoods together (so it hides the fact that there are barely any shrimps). We ordered a Cajun spicy and a naked spicy. Boy was it watered down. The spiciness was definitely there but there was none of that garlic/lemon taste the servers said there would be.  As for the 2 apps, we tried the mac and cheese and Cajun fries. The mac and cheese come shortly after we ordered and was served on a skillet, it was okay. The Cajun fries that I ordered came AFTER our boil came out and it was just your everyday seasoned fries. Once I saw how plain it was I thought they forgot the Cajun seasoning so I asked our server if Cajun spice was suppose to be sprinkled on but she said ""no the fries are marinated"".  Don't come. Don't eat here. I rather fly to LA for boil than  eat here ever again."	2star
I'm a big fan of Friedman's.  I usually go to the uptown location near Columbia.  I really like they healthy food choices and standard GF options on their menu. I came here on a Monday after work for a quick sit-down before a class a block away.  It was a bit crowded, but I was okay sitting at the bar.  From the time I sat down, until the time I left, I was moved three times, one stool at a time, to accommodate other patrons at the bar who wanted to sit together, but each arrived at separate times.  That was incredibly off-putting and annoying. The manager tried to compensate by offering me a glass of wine, but I was going to a class and not interested in a drink.  He kept apologizing, and ultimately gave me a small discount on my bill.  In the end, though, I'll probably never step foot in here again.  I regularly eat out alone, and have never, ever had such an experience of feeling like a third-class citizen because I was solo since keeping a group together at the bar (with no reservations) was more important.	2star
Really great service, attentive staff. The food was good but not great. I would have hoped for fresher pasta. Beautiful presentation. We got the fettuccine with truffle oil and mushrooms and the spaghetti carbonara with pancetta. The two dishes were good but I've had better. Beautiful decor. Very quiet restaurant so a great environment if you want to have an intimate conversation.	4star
Got here early on a Saturday evening. No reservations. The polite and amiable host said all the tables were booked so us 3  sat at the bar.  The bartender was skillful with the cocktails and very friendly.  The space was cozy and nice. The gin martini my friend ordered was expertly made.  Too bad the food was mediocre to sad. The guacamole and ceviche were tasty. But the octopus cazuelita entree was made up of a slab of chewy/tough octopus on a board with 5 small ramekins of sides. None of them stood out. All were meh and almost cold.  The Maqueca mixta seafood dish my friend ordered was okay but for the slick of dende oil floating on top.  We won't be returning. You let me down Yelpers!	2star
Since achieving a Michelin star, we wanted to try the food here. We didn't have a reservation but we were seated immediately even though it was busy. The service was excellent, very attentive. We started with some cocktails and guacamole.  The guacamole was so good!! I could have eaten the entire bowl myself. You could really tell that it was homemade and fresh.  The margarita was delicious, but it didn't taste like the special of the day that I had ordered, it tasted like a regular margarita.  For the main dishes, my husband and I shared 3 dishes between us, 2 portions of tacos (pork & brisket) and chicken enchiladas. Our server took our order and then came back to check he had definitely got it right - and the order still came out wrong! We ended up with chicken taco, which we had to send back for the pork ones. It wasn't a deal breaker though as we already had lots of food to share between us already and if anything it meant that we had hot tacos to eat when the correct order came out as opposed to them going cold waiting for us to get around to eating them!  My favorite items were the tacos, in particular the brisket. It was juicy, full of flavor and tasty. The pork was also very nice, they had a kick to them from the chilies! I enjoyed the chicken enchiladas but didn't think there was anything particularly special about them. I'd probably give them a miss next time and try something different.  Overall, it was a great meal and after I've tried everything else in LIC, I will probably revisit. Especially just to have that guacamole again!! So good!	4star
Exorbitant prices for less than mediocre food. This place appeared promising as the exterior and interior of the place were quite aesthetically pleasing however there are many places with better decor with actually good food. The cafe was pleasant however I would not recommend trying the restaurant.	2star
Three friends and I were in the mood for some soup dumplings so we decided to give Shanghai Asian Manor a try and we weren't disappointed! We ordered their principal pork Xiao Long Bao or soup dumplings, steamed vegetable dumplings, steamed shrimp dumplings, and stir fried rice cakes with pork and veggies. The food was amazing and definitely filling! I also ordered their soybean milk which was so fresh with hint of sweetness that really helped wash everything down! There is usually a bit of a wait so put down your name and get a number as soon as you go in!	5star
Selected this spot for birthday dinner and also as the beginning of a Friday night on the town for some visiting friends and family. At first, I was concerned about them being in the typical cramped Manhattan restaurant which is atypical for the rest of America, but there is something about the atmosphere at La Lanterna di Vittorio that outshines the fact that four people are seated at a table barely big enough for coffee let alone dinner service. That was exceptional. We got pizza and it was okay. It wasn't spectacular and I wouldn't come back for it  - this is definitely a restaurant you go to for the atmosphere.	3star
"Came in for lunch with my dad, it was during the week. It was the end of lunch rush and noticed a lot of professional crowd which entailed me to hold the place to strict standards. The server did not have a name plate which forced my jargon onto ""excuse me miss"". A name plate would have made the environment better as that I would of been able to make a connection with our waitress, which in turn relates to a better experience for me ""customer"". The service could have been better, such as a greeting of the day and a more Up type dialog. Over all 7/10! The place however is spot on but I do have an observation to make. I was sat facing the window and at around 245pm the sun was beaming down on my face. I had to dodge in other to hold conversations with my party. I was looking for some sort of curtain or blind and nope. I mean come on, even IHOP or Dennys could have alleviated this discomfort. Food was so, so... I had some steak marinated in wine or some sort. I forgot, it must been regular as I can recall certain stake at other places. It came with fries that where some sort soggy and without presence. Overall I was neither satisfied nor satisfied.. I find that the place could be great for some crowds or also certain traffic times.  The problem I Tinder is if indeed this place should be on Park Ave.. just my .2cts  Thank you for your time!"	4star
After reading the positive reviews on this place I decided to take a trip to Brooklyn from the Bronx with my husband and daughter. I really regret it. The hostess that sat us practically threw our menus that on our table and walked away rudely.I really wanted to like this place but the food was mediocre on top of us being treated like second-class citizens at a place where we were spending our money. I had dry ass chicken and waffles. My husband had an omelette with fakeass eggs. And my daughter was underwhelmed with her eggs and hash browns. The young lady at the door made me and my family feel very unwelcome and we will never be back.	2star
"terrible  service. food wasnt that good for a 45 minute wait on some pork buns and shumai.... i would not recommend this place that value their time. when i went to question why my food was taking so long, an employee rudely tells me "" we are making it now"". that was one of the worst experiences i've had. okay food, long wait time, rude staff, no thanks. i will not be going back."	2star
Meet up with the husband here for a few drinks. Decor was nice with a sea theme, fish tank, lamps with stars in 'em. It was clean and I think seemed out of place for the neighborhood its in. I ordered gin and tonic, a beer after, bartender was nice. The crowd were full of 20 and 30 somethings. Place to just chill. Next time I come I'd have to try the food.	3star
Small portions of overpriced food that's mediocre at best.  The chicken wings saved the day though.   Good for hipsters and their kids.  Wish they had some bowls of soup that were not 15$	2star
4 stars for food, minus 1 for service. made a reservation for 730 for two people. i was about 5 minutes early so they said the table wasn't ready yet and they invited us to wait at a small table next to the hostess station. we agreed and ordered a drink while we waited. five minutes go by, ten, twenty... no word from the hostess. we check in with her and she says the table will be ready soon. at the thirty minute mark, i gave up and just asked a waiter to be served at the table we were waiting at. right after placing our orders, the manager/owner (not sure what he is) came by to ask us if we were still waiting for our table and we told him no, we weren't. we weren't given an apology for the wait, he just left it at that and proceeded to seat other parties. now on to the more pleasant parts of the evening: the food. as a starter, we ordered the sardinian flatbread that was sprinkled with some type of cheese and truffle oil. very savory appetizer, but since the flat bread is so light (it's more of a cracker), it won't fill you up before you carb loan on your pastas. for entrees, we ordered the pappardelle with ragu (fantastic, filling portion) and the gnocchi with truffle sauce. both pastas were flavorful and memorable. you can tell that it's all made in-house; the gnocchi were perfect little pillows. i really want to go back and i would recommend it to the others, but would advise them that a wait, even with a reservation, should be expected.	3star
One of the best meals I've had in a while! I usually don't order chicken, because it tends to be the most uninspired dish on the menu, but when the table next to us had ordered the dish, it smelled SO GOOD! I had to try it! How often do you get jealous of your neighbors dish, by smell alone!?  The chicken dish lived up to its olfactic reputation and was so tasty! I loved that it wasn't filled with carb loaded filler food but with healthy vegetables.  I also tried the Roasted cauliflower & fresh cheese appetizer which was also SO flavorful! CAULIFLOWER! FLAVORFUL! So good! Service was great and prices were average for nyc standards.	5star
Hard to hype up a place more than L'Artusi. I really should've snagged a reservation here before its popularity skyrocketed into another dimension. I've known about the spot for a few years but put it on the back burner because I figured no one really knew about it. Boy, was I wrong. But it turns out that I'm a very lucky girl, because the bf booked a table here for our anniversary this past Friday. I've managed to get him into the NYC food scene, and L'Artusi has been on our joint list since his best bro bud mentioned it (bros always need bros to confirm, I guess). So when I thought I'd be calling it a night early on Friday, I was mistaken--we ended up at L'Artusi for a fabulous dinner. I love surprises and I love food, so it's safe to say that my man knows me well. Our experience here was easily five stars, but it could've been ever better. We'll be back for more. Now, onto the goodies. Came here at 9:15 on Friday. Our time here actually didn't start out too well--we had to wait about 20-35 minutes for our table and were famished by the time we sat down. I get that L'Artusi is the place to be at these days, but they need to do a better job of managing patron flow in that way. Thankfully, service post-sitting down was great. Our waitress was knowledgable and everything that she recommended, after our input, was spot-on.  When it comes to alcohol, L'Artusi is first and foremost a wine palace (there's a private wine room here!). Their wine selection is as extensive as it gets, all of it being from Italy. The menu layout itself is as good an advertisement as any--pages up pages of wine, organized by region with corresponding photos. Man, I can't wait to go to Italy. Next anniversary?  In any case, the wine here is as good as you'd expect. Our waitress let me sample a few options to help discern what I was in the mood for (as any good wine spot does). Again, she nailed it. I also tried one of the cocktails, the Stowaway (el dorado 5yr rum, pineapple, lemon, agave, cayenne). Seriously good. I'm not sure why you'd come to a place like this if you don't like wine, but if that profile happens to fit for you, I can happily report that the cocktail program is as good as the rest of what's offered here. I'm always on the lookout for spicy cocktails made with something other than tequila, and this fit the bill. My bf tried the Southern Belle for his first cocktail (screw gender roles), which I enjoyed but not as much as my pick.  For me, the food here is the main attraction. I was before I dined here, and I'll maintain that now. This place does everything well. Meats, cheeses, veggies, pastas. One of the best Italian meals I've had in the city. I was stuffed at the end of our meal (all food below was split between 2) and I have absolutely zero guilt about it. Eats, below: Cheese and crackers: A+ Oh my word. This honestly might have been the best thing we ate all night. I'm pissed that I can't remember what two cheeses we ordered, though not surprised because our waitress picked them for us. We asked for one hard, one soft. They were both magical. I was partial to the hard one, the bf partial to the soft one. Both amazing. Roasted mushrooms w/pancetta, fried egg, chilies, ricotta salata: A+ These did not disappoint, and my expectations were high after reading the glowing Yelp reviews. Sticking a fried egg on top of most things is a good idea. Putting it on an assortment of perfectly seasoned roasted mushrooms is a slam dunk, as far as my taste buds are concerned. Two of my very favorite things. Add some salt and some savory with the pancetta and you've got yourself a perfect verdura plate. Gnocchi w/ rabbit, tomato, basil, parmesan: A- Shockingly, the least exciting dish of the night. At first I thought it was because gnocchi is my least favorite kind of pasta, but the bf was disappointed too. Not bad, but compared to the rest of our meal, lackluster. Solid dish, seasoned well, but I'd opt for another pasta next time. Quail alla w/ piastra pear, walnut, radicchio, taleggio: A Can't pass up a good-looking quail dish. Definitely one of the meats I've warmed up to in adulthood. Great flavors, rich but not too heavy.  Venison/farro/grapes: A+ This was the special entree for the night and thank god we jumped at the opportunity to try it. Before Friday, I was under the impression that the bf didn't eat deer, so I'm grateful that I was wrong. Perfectly cooked meat and impossibly tasty farro. More of a winter dish for sure, but I didn't mind.  L'Artusi is a great option for a special occasion--particularly a romanic one. Dim lighting, intimate vibe and couples buzzing around everywhere. Have your Lady and the Tramp moment with your loved one--just know you'll need Lady's pocket to afford the meal.	5star
Great steaks and sides. Expect the usual hipster decor and wait. As far as steak rank, I hold it on bottom of my ladder. A steak cannot be a steak if it is not dry aged. I will never eat here again.	1star
Shopping at Ikea brought me to Red Hook and it was a perfect opportunity to go to Hometown. We arrived around 11:30 and were glad to see a short line indoors which took about 15 minutes. Feeling peckish I ordered the brisket tacos, pork belly banh mi and corn bread. The ordering is very efficient and professional, I was amazed at the rate they take orders.  The end product is stellar. Easily the best BBQ I have had in the city, making the long trip to Red Hook very worthwhile. Despite being close to room temperature my banh mi sandwich with lamb belly was superb. Drenched in grease and filled to the brim with rich, fatty lamb meat, the sandwich was a true mouthful but so darn good. The accompanying veggies were perfectly spiced for a unique interpretation of banh mih in a BBQ context.  I also highly recommend the tacos, the shells are well cooked and crispy and the brisket is delectable. The corn bread is also great.  Will certainly have to come back here and won't need Ikea as an excuse.	5star
a fine place if you live near hear and don't feel like making dinner or want a casual place for snacks and drinks. overall, wasn't too impressed by the food we got. the place is small and we arrived when it had just opened, but filled up quickly with people popping in a for a casual bite. a large menu with many options to satisfy even the most diverse group. started with the karaage and the yellowtail scallion sushi roll.  both were good. interestingly the karaage was served with regular deli mustard as a dipping sauce. and i think that speaks to the style of food in general at this restaurant.  it's sort of like food you make at home, using normal ingredients you would find in anyone's cupboard. for entrees we got the miso ramen and the mentaiko spaghetti. the soup for the miso ramen was pretty good, which says a lot since i don't really care too much for ramen soups. but the noodles were clearly the instant ramen noodles. nothing special. the spaghetti was very dry, which isn't the norm for mentaiko spaghetti, and the noodles also felt like the instant ramen noodles instead of spaghetti. and it used some kind of spicy or jalapeno to make the noodles spicy, which isn't in character with the traditional recipe. for dessert we got the mango coconut cheesecake, which was, again, good, but nothing special.  there's nothing wrong with the food here and the price point is fair. the service was also good and they were really nice.  so if you're in the area and feel like a casual bite, feel free to stop in.	2star
Rude waiter! Other staff were friendly and food was good but the waiter's attitude really ruined the experience us.	2star
"The plum wine is really good since I prefer sweet wine:) the shrimp tempura is ok for me b/c I sensed a little ""fishy taste"" there.  Katsu Don is really good in spite of the taste and size.  UNA Don is ok, I would say it's not the ""astonishing"" eel meal for me but considering the price and size, it's not bad.  Kara-age is good, soft fried crab is also good."	4star
First time having dinner here. I got the paella because I saw that it was mentioned a ton in previous reviews. While the plating for the paella was beautiful with a large lobster on top of the entire dish, the actual paella itself was just average. The seafood items in it were slightly bland, and the rice was not well seasoned. Seemed like a disappointment for $33.  The sangria was good. I got the Spanish Harlem sangria and it was as good as sangria can get. I liked the subtle cinnamon taste in it.  Just so you know before you go - the check in deal for the sangria is only valid on weekdays excluding Friday.  Service was pretty slow. The server disappeared for almost half an hour before taking our order. I think it was just one guy working almost half the restaurant. I would come here again because the atmosphere is cool - inside a hotel, dim lighting, pretty decor, and the menu items look amazing.  I'm hoping it was just an off night because I've heard great things about this spot.	3star
I'll give it a two since I don't think I have a taste for Arepas. I don't see the appeal. But for those that would like to try it I'd recommend this place. This was a fun place, nice lively crowd and good service. Prices are inexpensive and these things really fill you up.	2star
Brunch is my one of fave things to do and this place did not disappoint. On top of the food being ah-mazing, one complimentary brunch cocktail is free (to the owners, you don't have to but it is appreciated).  I got the Benedict Johnny - perfect poached eggs resting on a delicious cheddar cornbread (the best corn bread I've ever had), topped with a great roasted tomato hollandaise and accompanied by maple chicken sausage and home fries. (This was a tough review to write, now my stomach is growing and my mouth watering).  My friend got the Sicilian baked eggs - it was delicious as well. The spicy tomato sauce was a little too strong for me but my friend liked it. We ran out of the ciabatta way before the eggs because bread here is crack.  Service is great! Can't wait to eat here again.	5star
Help! I'm addicted to Uglyduckling's chicken and waffles. Seriously help me because not only is it on their brunch menu, you can get it for dinner too!!!! Food is outstanding, mixed drinks are strong and satisfying. This is hands down one of my favorite spots in the hood. On other occasions I have ordered mac and cheese and the ahi tuna burger (which are both delicious) but, even at this moment, all I can think about is their chicken and waffles. BONUS - They have lots of TVs! Great for watching games and making new friends at the bar.	5star
I think this place gets lots of tourists from the hotel (bentley)  down the block... I am a native New Yorker. Have lived in this hood for years.. Lets talk...  Nice looking restaurant with indoor and garden. Waiters push you to choose the most expensive saki and beers on the list.  It is average sushi. I have had amazing sushi in nyc (west coast sushi is w a y better but nyc does have some good places and you can spend the same $$ and get better).   And this was not it . My bf thinks they gave us sushi/sashimi for one instead if 2. I agree. There was one piece of each type nigiri,.. 2 people eating, there should be 2 of each. Sushi/sashimi delux for 2 $70! Expensive for average sushi. We ended up going to 'Roy's fish market'  on 1st ave for more takeout sushi...  I had the salmon burger for takeout once and it was greasy and gross.	2star
"It was a fine experience and the food was gold enough, but I saw the owner go up to another patron, grab a drink out of his hand, and throw it on the ground while saying that he should ""never come here again."" Very unprofessional. Would not recommend coming here when ownership would treat patrons like this."	1star
I'd give 2.5 stars if that was an option just for the nice server Imani. Our server was great and the atmosphere was good but our food wasn't hot and honestly I just didn't like it. It was ok enough to finish but I wouldn't go back unfortunately because I wanted to love Umami Burger. We had a K-BBQ and a truffle burger. Both were cold and our truffle fries were pretty cold as well. Besides temperature the flavor wasn't anything to make me want to give it another try. I'm really disappointed about it.	2star
"Loved the waffle, the chicken was good (not the best) but combined it is a good dish. WAIT: Came on a Saturday morning of Halloween weekend at 11:45am and didn't have to wait at all! The place is pretty small and the tables are close to each other so for 2 of us it's not that hard to find a spot.   ATMOSPHERE: Reminds me a little of pies n thighs but a little more ""trendy"" with Beyonce blasting, and picnic tables in one area, lots of decor and a fun atmosphere.  Very good ""brunch"" feel.  FOOD: For brunch their menu is a little different than what I've seen for weekday brunches or dinners.  They have specials too written on the chalkboard.  CHICKEN AND WAFFLES - 2 pieces of chicken (you can request dark meat) and the plain waffle (4 pieces).  All their waffles come with 3 types of butter (berry, thai/rosemary and plain).  The butter didn't have THAT much flavor so it wasn't quite necessary but still cool.  The waffles weren't doughy and I wish they were a little more crispy but they had a good texture and flavor.  They weren't too sweet or overwhelming probably to help with the fact that you're eating fried chicken.  The syrup was really good though, with a pure maple taste.  The waffle was definitely the highlight.  The chicken is moist and the skin is crispy, but maybe a little too peppery for me.  I like pies n thighs better because it has more of a simple fried chicken taste.   Overall, very good waffles and pretty good chicken."	4star
It deserves the title of best Greek food around.  It is absolutely incredible. My only complaint is that the inside is really noisy, so I recommend sitting outside. My favorite thing on the menu is the grilled shrimp.  It's beautifully cooked, butterflied, and seasoned with lemon olive oil. No fishy taste at all.  Great place to bring someone that claims they hate seafood--it will change their minds!	5star
Since I had a Groupon, the boyfriend and I stopped into Butcher Bar for an early dinner one Sunday after visiting the Museum of the Moving Image just down the block. From the longhorn skull displayed on the wall above the bar, to the all-wood rustic décor, could it feel any more like a Texas smokehouse? Their mac 'n cheese was oh-so-savory, especially with the beans and bacon cooked right in, and was my favorite part of our meal. The Monster, which was my 50/50 pulled pork & brisket sandwich, was too sweet and not the pull-apart tender people like in their BBQ - but a little extra spicy sauce fixed that right up. Ended on a high note with their warm and gooey apple caramel cornbread dessert, though~	3star
Came here for a quick lunch, we ordered from the lunch special menu. it was pretty disappointing. I ordered the taro with sliced pork belly over rice, my mother ordered the spareribs over rice. Spareribs were so tough to eat.  Service was excellent tho, they found a nice seat for us so we could put my son (infant) next to us. They also have an infant changing table, which is GREAT! So i definitely applaud them for that!	2star
I've been trying to call all day to make a reservation, phone # listed here and on website do not work???	1star
I normally don't do yelp reviews. I think this is my first ever, yet I'm hoping the owner reads this and get's the message.  This is the third restaurant in the space. They've all shared the same common trait and I've never come back. Employees that hated being there. No water. They always try to charge you for it. I even saw cups behind the counter, they said I couldn't have it, only hot water was allowed. Then the beef soup was lackluster, the chilly oil was overwhelming and added nothing to the flavor. I asked for it on the milder side, it was so spicy I had to throw it out.  There are so many better soup choices in the area. The only reason I'm writing a review, is that I hope the owner finally understands, that customer service and a good product is vital to having guests come back. I would be a lunch regular. I order, sometimes 3 times a week if I like the place. Instead. I'll never come back.	1star
I made a lunch reservation for Galli with a friend and we both found this restaurant to be okay. I really do like the decor and interior of this restaurant, but the food was not great. I did enjoy my delicious Tuna tartare, but that was about it. Would I return? Probably not.	3star
Came here for HH with a friend cause we thought we could squeeze in some food and alc for cheap but thang the bill came out and we both agreed not to come here again :/ The only thing we enjoyed were the fries! Wings were eh, and the oysters for HH were super disappointing :/ didn't taste fresh to us. Maybe it was just that batch of the day. We really wanted to find a spot for good HH oysters but after this experience, we haven't gone out to find good oysters for cheap again.	2star
Delicious food with a nice ambiance: Kalbi - really delicious Lobster pad thai - this was a rather large dish and it was pretty good Thai iced tea - not great Khao soi - good Cheesecake dessert - delicious	4star
Went here about two weeks ago with friends. I'm a southern girl so Bbq is something I'm pretty picky about. I thought the pulled pork was excellent, however...the baked beans were terrible. I disliked the jalapeño taste in the BBQ baked beans (just yuck-couldn't eat them).  The mac & cheese looked gross (white?). And the one thing that totally turned me off was the noise. The music was blaring so loud that we couldn't hear each other. We just sat eating our below par food trying to hear each other...not a good overall experience.	2star
Food is good but the store policy is stupid.  If you drop your drinks by accident and even didn't open it yet, you have to buy another one. So I'd prefer not purchase the drink again.  Beware, this is not Starbucks. Use both your hand to hold your drinks here, they're precious!!!	1star
The great New York experience. My boyfriend and I were here for 8days visiting our best friend. This was our second time here because we want to try so much from the menu! All the food and drinks were both so amazing I don't think we could've gone wrong with anything. But what truly had made this second time the greatest was our Amazing waitress!!! Christine! She was impeccable!! Christine was intuitive she knew exactly what we needed without words. She was so generous and friendly! Funny and personal-able! We felt so comfortable with her. We've eaten at so many restaurants. She's been the best waitress we've ever had across the nation!	5star
It's pretty interesting this restaurant was rated so high. Maybe for the friendliness of the staff or the ambiance, or how quick it took?? But my ratings are based on the FOOD. Chicken skewers: hardly any chicken on the skewers, it was touch to chew, no flavor, AND the peanut sauce was watery and no flavor. Didn't even finish.  Chicken fried rice: the rice was mushy, and barely any chicken in it. I guess this was our fault for ordering chicken fried rice from a Thai restaurant and not Chinese. Didn't finish either. Lastly I ordered the vegetable glass noodle soup: the noodles were good... that's all I really have to say.  Maybe the other entrees are good? Good luck!	1star
"Me and my boyfriend came here on a Thursday night for a date night. Place is pretty small and intimate. We were seated near the back. We ordered our drinks first didn't get them until after we ordered our food. WATERED DOWN. The food was mediocre, mac pie we could have made at home. The jerk ribs were not tender at all, very tuff. The bake and shark was okay and the tamirine wings were the best thing that we had. Poor excuse of a ""Caribbean restaurant"""	2star
This restaurant is incredibly overpriced.  We ordered the prawn nasi goreng and the dish came out with tiny shrimps that might as well been From the freezer isle.  12 for fried rice was not with it.  having just returned from Indonesia where this dish is $2.....it is a rip off!	1star
Very attractive space. Had already run out of bread (for which they charge $3) at 7:30 on a Sunday evening. I split the chicken dish with another: chicken pot pie was excellent, other elements were average. Wife had the chitarra dish; she quite liked it but it tasted rather bland to me. We ordered the donuts for dessert; the donuts themselves had no flavor, no sugar coating, etc. they were just balls of fried flavorless dough. They're served with a little dish of a brown sugary syrup that tasted a bit burnt. Service was incredibly slow. Dinner took 2 hours 30 minutes, and that was for our entrees and dessert. Two courses. Not ok. Would not recommend.	2star
"This place survives strictly on tourists and Wall Street hotheads.  Tourists will think they are getting that ""old New York"" feeling, which this place curates right down to the nimrod host with the fake Irish accent.  $8 for a Smithwick's? $9 for a Lagunitas?  These are Times Square prices, and do make sense at the South Street Seaport, which ""neighborhood"" however appears to have uprooted its trashy tourist attractions in favor of slavering over yuppie interlopers and shops devoted to gourmet salt.  Phony, hoodwinking, obscenely priced: stay away from The Paris Cafe."	1star
We ordered 3 dishes. One of the curry beef was unreasonably sweet. Also, the rice was cold and hard. Thought maybe the leftover from last night. Not going back no more.	1star
The restaurant was spacious, pretty & perfect for a date because the lights are dim. The service was good.  Squidink linguine (3.5) - the sauce & shrimps however, the noodles seems to be a little undercook. I love it when the noodles is soft.  Misto fritto (4/5) Carbonara pasta (4/5)  Overall, it's a good restaurant and I would come back to try other items.	4star
The authenticity of these freshly hand pulled Xi'an noodles was apparent the moment you walk in. This restaurant doesn't invest their money in fancy tables and chairs or expensive interior design, rather their main focus is on their menu. They had all sorts of options from lamb to beef to vegetarian.I ordered their trademarked spicy and tingly beef hand-pulled noodles. My main complaint is the noodle itself and the overall taste. The only taste I could was the spiciness of the sauce and the noodles were too thick.  There's not a lot of seating so don't come with big groups. Usually hand-pulled noodles are only good when fresh so my advise is to avoid getting it to-go. Everything on their menu looks so visually appealing and I would love to come back and give the other dishes a try.	3star
A Brooklyn favorite for years! I'll start off with my cons and say, it's still very inconvenient that they only take cash! I also wish that the happy hour was extended. I would love if those two things would be modified. Now, that my cons are over, on to the things I love! The atmosphere is amazing, the staff and the other visitors are always friendly and don't mind engaging in conversations. On Sundays there's movie night where the outdoor seating area is. My favorite things on the menu are the corn, the tacos and of course the Cuban sandwich. I've been coming here for years, happy to see the business still doing well!	4star
I had fish tacos and Rice and beans for lunch and it was NOT GOOD. The fish was smelly and rice and beans was blow average. First time experience at Amaranto wasn't good. It take 25/30 min for to get my food to my table and the restaurant was empty during lunch time.  NOT HAPPY!	1star
As this is a new place, everything looks neat and clean. The space at this location is not as spacious as the other guy kaku in New York, as this place used to be a small karaoke place located at the busiest street in flushing main street. Their friendly staff and happy hour are competitively priced for most of the items, beating the other bbq places in the area. Which makes it ideal for a quick bite for lunch and won't break the bank even if you go here often. The difference between this Gyu-Kaku is that, they have less item on their menu compared to the other location in Manhattan. Depending on the time and day you are looling to go, reservation are recommended if you are going with a big party, as this place gets filled up quick. Overall this place has a nice vibe, friendly staff, and a great addition of a bbq place for those that is in the area. Looking forward to going back here again. No need to travel to manhattan if you're in the area.	4star
This service is great, but the food is just so-so, which I wasn't quite expecting with all of the hype. I went on a Friday night around 7. We (two of us) got there just in time for a table because a line of a dozen people stood by shortly after we were seated. I highly recommend making a reservation because the space is extra small (although there is a patio for when the weather cooperates!). My friend and I started with a pitcher of red sangria, which was delicious. We shared all of our tapas - the mussels, the mahi taquitos and the pork sliders. By far my fave were the mussels - the broth was divine! I didn't prefer the mahi mahi taquitos because the fish was fried and a bit greasy. The sliders were great and savory, just not something I would order again. I'm not sure I'll come back, but I'm glad that I went one time! I am also curious to watch the chopped episode :)	3star
"It was a terrible experience. I live around the corner from this place and decided to finally give it a try. After the first 20 minutes of sitting in the restaurant, I decided I will never be going back there. This place is CRAMPED. Expect your back to be touching the back of the person sitting behind you. You might even be elbowed in the gut by your neighboring table.     The staff was unfriendly. As we sat down at the bar (because there were no available tables), the bartender placed cups of water in front of us while rolling her eyes for no reason -- Not a good first impression of your establishment. Then, she asked us for our order by rudely/abruptly saying, ""Whatcha gettin"". Please train your staff some basic professionalism and hospitality.    We ordered 2 enchilada verdes, which were overpriced at $18 each, and waited a long time for them (at least 30 minutes) even though the entire time, we didn't see food leave the kitchen except for guacomole and chips that everyone around us seemed to only be ordering. Their enchilada verdes was the worst we've ever eaten, something as I could imagine Gordon Ramsey would only compare to as ""eating a wet diaper"". We could tell the enchiladas were frozen, not fresh, the tortillas were a soggy mush that disentegrated from the touch of my fork, the chicken was dry, and the whole dish was bland. A pile of green mush slopped onto a plate. Not to mention after eating the food, we got stomach problems...aka diarrahea. Our stomach pain is lasting into the next day. Since I live so closeby, I was hoping to find another place to add to my list of regular spots, but no thanks, I learned my lesson and will never be returning here again. Eat here at your own risk."	1star
Very very delicious.  The finest recipes from Spain indeed!  I went to Spain many years ago in college and don't remember the food being this tasty (probably because I didn't go to the right places), but Despana makes me want to go back...   Try their chorizo (or any bocadillo with chorizo), the canarias (flauta) and boquerones.  Yum!! I personally would pass on the tosta cebolla (too sweet for me), brandada (I'd rather eat more of one of the above!) and afuega cheesecake (I love dessert, but this was just okay for me).	4star
Came here on a Saturday around 11:30 with 2 other friends and the wait time was about 40 minutes. When we finally got seated we each placed our orders and waited for our food to come out. We quickly noticed though that although the place is small it's quite busy, hence the 40 min. wait time and that there's actually only one waitress working.  She's was pretty on top of things so kudos to her(which is why I gave 3 stars) but that's still very risky to have only one waitress for 9 table venue with a 10 to 12 seating bar. For my meal I got the black fish sliders and they were ok; nothing spectacular as I've had better.My other two friends got the fried chicken with bread and they liked it. This place was just ok in my book but I don't think it deserves more than 2 to 3 stars.	3star
I've lived in New York for 30 years, and I eat out all the time.  Becco was a huge disappointment. I thought because Lydia Bastiach was the owner the food would be good, but it's on the same level as Olive Garden. It's Italian American food for people that have never tried real Italian food. The antipasta was a joke. Two pieces of cut up carrot. Two slices of zuccini thay were oily. The pasta wasn't much better. The spaggetti with tomato sauce was gummy, and the sauce had no flavor. My sons veal parmesan also had no flavor. I'm giving the place 2 stars because I  liked my seafood with polenta. The fish was fresh and grilled nicely.  This is a theater district location, so it was jam packed and super loud. I didn't see any New Yorkers, and we won't be back.	2star
We lined there for maybe about 45 minutes but it was so worth it !  We took 6 ribs, 200g of pulled pork and 200g pork belly.  The ribs were the best we both ever had, the meet was so juicy and soft, it was awesome, and so tasty at the same time ! Also we both expected it to be small, and that there would be not so much meat on it but it was really full of meat !  The pork belly was really good too and the pulled pork was good but not my favorite tho. I'd say focus on the ribs because they are definitely the best.  We also had the baked beans, that were awesome, and the broccoli salad, that we both didn't like.	4star
Amazing xiao long bao! Definitely one of the best Ive had. The rice cake with shredded pork was also so good with the perfect balance of sweet and savory. The beef with tripe was pretty solid as well. It seemed like most of our food was cold though :( we got the soymilk and it was super watery and the shanghai udon stirred noodle was pretty tough bc it wasnt cooked fresh. Our waiter gave us quite the attitude too, so i give it 4 stars overall!	4star
"A beautiful rooftop view has earned this place an extra star.  It really is a wonderful place to check out the Manhattan skyline.  The food is mediocre and the service....terrible.  We waited for well over 45 minutes for our pizza.  I inquired and was told that they were coming out of the oven. 15 minutes later....still no pizza.  When I complained about our wait (and the fact that many patrons who arrived after us were already eating their pizza), I was told ""No, there are actually a lot of people who have been waiting over an hour."" So there you have it. Go for the view...maybe a drink...but not with children and certainly not if you're hungry!"	2star
What can I say? Pies & Thighs was yummy! I had the catfish, corn bread, collard greens and baked beans..a mimosa too.. my daughter had the ftoed chicken- she loved it! I loved it! Waiter & hostess were sweethearts..I will be back!	5star
Not good! Decent if you're stoned! Lobster wasn't fresh, and they literally gave you a hot dog bun for the lobster roll!	2star
Only reason they get 1 star is because I have too. I came with a group of 7 so made a reservation beforehand. Once we arrived to the restaurant at 7:30 they scrambled around because they did not have a table ready for us. It took about 15 minutes so we got drinks at the bar and we had to ask them if our table was finally ready because they left us hanging. Once we sat down we ordered chips and salsa and it took them 20 minutes to bring we again had to remind them about it. The food did not come out until 9 oclock. Someone in my party asked if rice and beans comes with the enchiladas plate and he said yes. She ordered that and there was no rice or beans on her plate... The service was another issue we had about 3 different waitresses assigned to us. Just overall it was such a bad experience. Save your money and don't come here.	1star
"OK very mixed review so average was three stars: Service: one star, we were forgotten by our waitress  who was kinda of abrupt and annoyed that "" we didn't know we were doing "". No instructions on how the place functions, no greetings ,too much hustle and bustle.  Food: Fresh, tasty but way too long to be cooked. Things come to table in no order.Hard to have a complete meal to enjoy.What a shame because it is all good stuff. Atmosphere: reminds me my lunch breaks with my construction coworkers. Order as fast as you can , whatever you get is OK because you have limited time and your consuming not dining.  Too many good seafood restaurants in Astoria to eat at that you sit down and enjoy the meal.Here you feel like your on a lunch break on the docks and whistle is going to blow any minute."	3star
Great view--food is good--stick with simple dishes, salads, dips and you'll do fine. It is noisy!	3star
I wanted SO badly to love this place. I don't know if they were having an off night or if there was just some bad ju-ju surrounding our table, but this past Saturday night was a total disaster. -First things first, we'd made a reservation. We were seated 20 minutes after our reservation time.  -Our waitress spilled an entire tray of drinks all over my dad. We had to move tables because the booth was wet. Once at the new table we had no water, no napkins, and no one came back for a good 10 minutes.  -Someone showed up apologetically with some extra guacamole as a token of their apologies. Very kind. That was probably to distract us from the fact that it had, at that point, been an entire hour since we ordered food.  -A busser took all of our plates away while we were still eating chips and guac; during that time he reached over my friend, put his arm right in front of his face and *in* the guacamole that was about to be in his mouth. ?? -When the food arrived, my dad's steak was ice cold. He sent it back. It came back 20 minutes later - it was warm, but rare. (He had ordered medium well.)  By the time we all had our food, the magic was just gone. I'm sure it was fine, but nothing really stood out and we were starving anyway. We sort of scarfed everything down and tried to get the check. It took another 30 MINUTES before anyone even came near us, and when we asked for the check they just started putting spoons down. They gave us two small, mediocre desserts meant to make up for the rest of the evening, and I actually had to get up and find someone to give us the check a few minutes later. It was all handled very poorly and I'm not sure I'm eager to give it another try. So disappointing.	2star
Have no complaint at all! Language barrier was a bit difficult but we managed. They give you complimentary black tea and I order the chefs special #2 fried seafood ramen. It was relish! I recommend adding a bit of soy sauce and that's about it. Perfection ! I also ordered shrimp and beef dumplings which was good As well.	5star
Came here because shanghai asian manor was closed. Food wasn't too bad, and servings were large (loads of carbs). It was a good decision to share a rice and noodle dish between 3 people. Tried the 'chicken with delicious sauce' which was really just fried chicken in hoisin/oyster sauce, and was average. The waiter was attentive and filled our water frequently, but then again there were just two groups of us at 3pm on a weekday.  Nothing much to rave about.	3star
"If you're looking for a bar that doesn't care about customer service and makes costumers feel unwelcome then this is the place for you. I went to this bar with a bunch of friends for happy hour and dinner last week. The service sucks, the bartender gave everyone a hard time when ordering a drink. I don't care if he was busy, had a bad day or doesn't like his job you never give your customers attitude or bad service. The burgers were tasty, but stay away from their sliced chicken or as they call it ""UnWings"", it's just badly cooked sliced chicken. There's also this loud mouth old lady with big orange hair who talks out loud and looks like she's trying to find a ride home. No idea why you'd allow someone like that in the bar. She looked like a fool with her big orange hair and the way she was dressed. Pretty funny but weird at the same time. People never want to go here and I finally see why. The place looks cool but then you see this old plastic spiral menu and you're thinking wtf. Avoid uncorking the bottle with sword gimmick they have, it's pretty lame and a waste of money. Realistically not worth coming in, if the place has no value in taking care of their costumers and would rather not have repeat business then that stems from management /owner who probably has no idea about business."	1star
The burger from Peter Luger's is one of the best burgers I have ever had, and for that alone, this place is 5 stars for me. Over 1/2 lb., it's served with cheese and French fries on the side. Highly recommend to add their thick cut bacon. Medium rare, the burger is cooked perfectly and juicy. Add a little of the PL sauce to a few bites for a lil added sweetness. The PL sauce can be added to just about anything.  Their daily special of prime rib served with peas and mash potatoes was ordered and shared. Nice to try, but not my favorite dish. For dessert, we had the apple strudel, served with a very generous side of whipped cream. Sweet goodness and nice ending to the meal.  Peter Luger's is award winning and has had a Michelin star for several years. Service is straight forward and to the point, no fluff here. Cash, debit cards, or checks are acceptable forms of payment (no credit cards accepted).  A return visit is a must for me.	5star
"I'm a little stunned I'm here writing this. What started out as a 3/5 stars has quickly degenerated into a really crappy interaction with a business that is increasingly escalating.  I went to The Fat Monk on my birthday, June 7th, at 7pm. We had a reservation, and were seated promptly.  The server struggled to remember the specials, no big deal. We ordered 3 oysters, the scotch egg, the deviled eggs, my girlfriend ordered the duck burger, and I got the buccatini with boar bolognese.  If it sounds like I remember this very well, it's because I've already written this review once - in a comment on their Facebook page. Imagine my surprise when I received an email from them after not having ever signed up to their mailing list, so I went to see if they got my email from Facebook, and I find my comment had been deleted. Thinking this was clearly a glitch on my end, I remembered another negative comment on their feed that I went to find - also gone. I imagine they'll have harder time deleting this feedback.  From the top - the server returns and says that they're out of their super special duck burger. It's 7:00, and they're out? Whatever, she orders the normal burger - medium, but it sure would have been nice to know that when you were struggling to remember the specials for the night.  Oysters are on the small side, some oysters are like that, no big deal. The sauces are OK.  The deviled eggs were flavorless. They had a fried oyster on top, but that hardly made up for the almost complete lack of 'deviled' in the deviled eggs.  The scotch egg was likewise flavorless. It comes on a cutting board with 3-4 additional flavors you can add, one of those was salt. Think about that? They don't have salt and pepper on the table, because presumably the food is seasoned as chef wants it, but it's required here? The sausage was bland, and the egg was ""plated"" on a wooden cutting board with the yolk spilling out over the board. I happen to think the yolk in a soft boiled egg is one of the best parts, and I sort of wished I hadn't needed to scrape it off a porous board with a butter knife to taste it.  The bucatini - hollow tubes of noodles meant to make heavy sauces seem lighter and airier. Unfortunately this was a, likewise, bland bolognese. This made it seem like watery sauce served with air. Thankfully the server had a pepper grinder, I wish I'd asked him to leave it.  But the real star of this show is the burger. Which was ordered medium came out well done - I tried it to make sure. That would have been bad enough, but my girlfriend said there was something wrong with the tomato. I looked at it and saw it was yellowish-green. I said, that isn't close to ripe, and she thought it was a special variety of tomato - it wasn't. Someone in the kitchen looked at a green, unripe tomato and thought it was OK to send to the table. It wasn't.  So, this amalgam of disappointment wasn't really worth writing a yelp review. When they came across my facebook page with a bunch of seemingly canned comments I wrote a much gentler review that tried to give this as constructive feedback to the restaurant in a format that doesn't ding their yelp score.  I kid you not the comment was deleted AND I was added to their crappy mailing list with no response or outreach.  I don't really know how a business makes this better. I don't really want more of your food, and had you just ignored my comment or, I don't know, responded to it - we wouldn't be here. I'd be trying you out again after you've had some time to establish yourself, maybe 9 months from now.  Good day."	1star
Atmosphere is cool. Service was very good. The menu was small and the food was just ok. Pretty generic beer selection. I'd rate it 3.5 stars, but rounded it up to 4.	4star
"Call me crazy but I don't understand the hype about Jack's Wife Freda. The restaurant wasn't bad, but it wasn't 5 stars worthy (in my opinion) either.  My friend and I visited there on a very cold Friday afternoon, and we were told there was about a 15 min wait. The restaurant is very small and there is absolutely no waiting area even though people will obnoxiously cram inside while waiting for their table. Since we were one of the more polite customers, we decided to wait outside. It was freezing outside, so having their outside heaters on definitely helped.  We were seated pretty fast (having waited only 10 min) and our table was right by the entrance. At first I was happy since it was a corner table which meant getting in to sit was easier than having to pull put the table like the others had to, but I was quickly disappointed. Every single time someone would come in or the hostess would go outside to get people off the waitlist, the door would just stay open for minutes and it was hella cold. I had my coat on for the whole duration of my lunch. There was also a couple waiting inside constantly gawking at our food - very annoying! And none of the employees even cared. Rant over, now onto the food. My friend had the Jack's burger, while I ordered the chicken kabob bowl with couscous. Our food was alright, nothing special though. The burger tasted just like any burger would. My chicken was well seasoned and well prepared. We tried their ""special hot sauce"" - tasty, but again nothing special about it. In the DMV area, you can get that same spicy green sauce at any Peruvian chicken restaurant.  The restaurant is cute and the food was alright."	3star
Had wings here.  Absolute worst.  Disgusting.  Didn't even finish them.  Stringy, crunchy, old.  Never again.  It never ceases to amaze you the garbage that businesses will feed you.	1star
"Pig and Khao is a great alternative to your typical American brunch selection. I've been here a couple of times already and I have to say, I'm quite impressed. By impressed I mean, I did not expect to enjoy the food this much. The flavors and texture of the food are on point. I've tried a wide selection of the brunch menu and my favorites are the Sizzling Sisig (not sure if I'm spelling this correctly) & the corn beef hash. These dishes are definitely on the more oily/salty side, but that's how I like it. The meat was so flavorful and I absolutely love it how it comes with a raw egg that becomes cooked right in front of you. Make sure you order a side of garlic rice with your dish. The garlic rice is so delicious! I tried the fried donuts and I suggest skipping this. It was nothing special and the green dipping sauce that came with it was kind of a turn off. I dont know why it was lime green... I also tried another sweet brunch item but I forgot what it was. Nevertheless, I would skip it altogether. As for the unlimited mimosas, it's $15 for 2 hours. They have 4 different flavors, but to be honest, I almost could not taste the differences haha. I was drawn to the fact that they had a lychee flavor! Maybe they added more champagne than the fruit puree.. but who's complaining? I would still try this if you haven't already! Overall, I've had a great experience here and I'd definitely come back here. This restaurant is one of those places you can take ""out-of-towners"" to. The atmosphere has a chill vibe to it and the staff are super friendly."	5star
Let me first start by saying the food and the bartenders/drinks are amazing here. That being said: This is a review based on the service I received by the wait staff. The hostess basically tossed menus on a table and then walked away. It was careless enough to make me actually notice it. The hospitality level here is certainly lacking. The waitress never put in our appetizer order and we ended up just getting our entrees. When we asked her about it at the end of our meal she said she was sure she put in the order and would find out what happened. When she dropped the bill she didn't explain to us what may have happened or apologize. It was pretty disappointing service but again, the drinks and food are great. Here's to hoping that management will improve on front of house staff. This place is a gem otherwise.	2star
Super friendly staff and fast services!  Super plus for the complimentary Thai tea  We ordered: 1. Kaffir Lime Lemongrass Tumeric Mussels - great flavors but on the saltier side. We had to order a side of rice to eat along with it. Definitely not an appetizer, more fitting for an entree! 2. Roti Canai Planta - hmm wasn't the best :/ it's quite small in portion and the dipping sauce was way too thick in my opinion.. more like a paste than sauce.. but that could be because we're the last customers at the moment but we were there a bit over an hour before closing so 3. Thai Tom Yum Soup - delicious! Perfect amount of sourness, sweet and thickness from the coconut milk and nicely blessed by the pepper god 4. Beef Pad Thai - darker than the usual pad Thai and turns out a bit saltier than usual but regardless, we enjoyed it! 5. Bo Luc Lac Flank Steak - great flavors but again, super salty :( I wish they served more vegetables with it to balance out the saltiness  6. Mixed Seafood Curry Laksa - yum! Totally will order this again. (If you love Curry Leaf from flushing who only open at 4am, you may come here for a quick substitute) Overall, the food quality is a 3 for me but friendly staff, complimentary Thai tea, and fast service brought it up another notch!	4star
Yikes I live in Southern California where Asian food thrives, this place sucks. I'm not trying to hate, the food simply is not good. killer sake menu guys but damn shut that kitchen down	2star
Atmosphere- large restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating, clean single bathrooms, and a bustling open kitchen.  Staff- could have been a little more attentive (I had to ask for condiments and refills), but they weren't neglectful.  Coffee was burnt terribly, so I switched to an earl grey tea. It was great (loose leaf), came in a steel pot, and free refills.  Food- the breakfast board was such a nice way to present 2 eggs with toast! One of my soft-boiled eggs was perfect, the other was hard-boiled. The pistachio butter was thick and delicious as was the rhubarb jam. The toast was ok, so switch to a huge flakey biscuit instead.	4star
This is a must try place in the island. I went on a Friday night and it was quite and not crowed which is hard to find in SI. Food was great appetizers were delish and service was awesome.	4star
Extremely offensive service I've ever encountered in my life, who the fuck you dumbass think you are?  Whole story: David Schwimmer was in the restaurant. I'm a big fan so I wanna take a photo with him. I meet a lot of celebrities, I do respect their privacy. So I didn't do anything taking photos on the back or even looked at him. I only asked if I can hav photos with him after the lunch, and he accepted, the whole conversation was really friendly. I was polite and didn't do anything! Then this great server came to my table implying I was intruding Mr. David's privacy. And saying thing you feel so insulted. When you talking about celebrities privacy, you should repspect another person as human being first.	1star
Cute seafood restaurant that I've been meaning to try.  Service: Great! We had dropped by right as the brunch hours were ending, but the waiter was kind enough to let us put in our orders immediately.  Food: We had ordered the crispy fish tacos, but was disappointed when it came out lacking in flavor.  Could be due to the fact that the kitchen was closing up, but I probably would have to retry it to see if it's better the second time around.	3star
Came with some friends for a birthday celebration. The service was just god-awful.  Simple drink orders got messed up, forgotten drinks, cold food, horrible service. (I can go on and on) but honestly that nights whole experience really left a sour taste.  I'm allergic to peanuts and requested certain dishes with peanuts to be made without or which ones were to avoid them completely and the waitstaff had no clue (really?) and still ended up being brought out dishes that had nuts in them.  I didn't wanna make a big scene because I didn't want to ruin my galfriends night. But for our group paying close to $700 on a tab they should of been more attentive service. I'll still enjoy TAO but that night was really off.  Bummer.	2star
Not so great -unfriendly wait staff. Some good good while other dishes quite unappetizing. Other reviews are correct - chili crab toast is excellent. Overpriced for what it is.	1star
Going to Joe's Shanghai and not getting the XLB would be like going to Dominique Ansel and not taking any pics of your food. Like, what are you doing with your life if you don't? The decision to get XLB was the easy part. Deciding exactly when to get here required extensive research: studying the documents, interviewing so-called Yelp Elites, analyzing Google data, and even wiretapping Joe's phone. Things don't always go according to plan though, so we didn't make it to Joe's til around 5:30 on a Saturday night. We still only had to wait about 10 mins to be seated. So, more FAKE NEWS from those that said to avoid Joe's on the weekend and/or at night due to long waits. After being shown to a banquet-like round table shared communal style, we ordered these 3 sizzling sensations: SOUP DUMPLINGS/XIAO LONG BAO (XLB): I may be a minority here (literally, ethnically, and figuratively), but I felt these largely lived up to the hype. Piping hot soup bursts into your mouth instantly upon biting into these, so if you wanna avoid getting burned, swallowing right away may work if you're DTF (down to finish) quickly without savoring the taste. For those that wanna take their time and do it right, there's like a 5 step process laid out on their website. SPICY SZECHUAN STYLE SLICED BEEF: since we had pork and crab above, the need to balance it out with some beef was a given. This dish had a solid meat ratio, a nice amount of spice to it, and goes well over steamed rice. Lucky pick since I didn't read any reviews on it beforehand. SINGAPORE CHOW MEI FUN NOODLES: a large portion. Not bad, but it wasn't that fun as the texture of the noodles didn't do anything for me. If you wanna know how I really feel about this, read into the fact that I didn't even bother to take a pic. But that's ok, because we primarily came here to take pics of the XLB. Or eat them, whatever.	4star
Came here for our Valentine's dinner before the actual holiday to avoid the madness.  It's a beautiful, classy restaurant full of top notch servers but I'm not sure if I could say the same thing about their food. We skipped the tasting menu and decided to do everything a la carte instead.  The famed beef cheek ravioli and spaghettini with the lobster were probably my faves.  The amatriciana a close second.  But the black spaghetti with rock shrimp?  It was so greasy with little to no flavor.  I felt like I was eating stir-fry. And the wine markups here are pretty ridiculous.  I've never been to a restaurant that served such a small amount of wine for probably 5x its value.  We barely got two glasses out of it per person for $200.  Yeah, no. I was getting a massive headache towards the end of dinner I could barely finish the amatriciana let alone try their dessert, although I really wanted to.  Our server was pretty great though, asking us after every course if we liked it even though we lied to keep him happy.  I'm glad I got to cross this off of my bucket list, but I most likely won't be coming here again.	3star
Amy Ruth's is the best soul food place I have ever tried. Honestly, I did not like chicken and waffles that much until I found here. Their chicken is crispy and seasoned amazingly well.. so chicken & waffles is highly recommended. I also tried their honey chicken and it was pretty good too. But if you visit this place first time, chicken and waffles may be a better option.  There usually are many people since it's a popular restaurant, so if you don't want to wait in line, go for early dinner or late lunch.	4star
I went with a group of 7 around 8pm on a Sunday and we were seated right away. The restaurant decor is modern and clean which is a plus, especially since they're serving raw fish. We immediately start looking at the menu and noticed a decent selection of sushi, Thai and Malaysian dishes. For appetizers, we order calamari bowl and coconut tiger shrimp. Then we order other dishes to share which includes salmon lover, sashimi platter, kamikaze roll, sexy roll, mussels, lambs, chicken pad thai and seafood udon. After everything is served, our group was still hungry! The food is pretty good but the problem is all the portions are quite small, especially the appetizers. We went ahead and ordered two more noodle dishes so we don't leave the restaurant with our stomach still growling. The bill came out to approximately $31 per person so it wasn't bad but the fact that we ate mostly noodles to fill us up did not justify for what we paid.	3star
Got here around 2:30 on a Thursday afternoon we were told the wait would be around 30 minutes for the 2 of us but it was almost an hour. Won't take away stars for that since it's a pretty popular restaurant. Before a waiter got to us an older gentleman (may be a manager or something) who walked us to our table explained the family style portions and welcomed us for our first time. After struggling to read the huge menu on the wall (I'm blind as a bat) I asked our waiter (I forgot his name ) for a paper menu because at this point I was trying to read the menu through yelp  After not that long of deliberation we decided on the Porterhouse Contadina which consists of a 45oz steak with potatoes peppers and sausage (we opted out of sausage because they were pork) and the manicotti. I'm not really a steak person but woooooooow this was probably the best steak I've ever had, so juicy and flavorful just super good. Manicotti was just as good the whole meal just delicious overall. Can't seem to remember my waiters name  but he was so helpful although he kept telling us we ordered too much food   The bread basket before the meal was equally as delicious I had to stop myself from getting full before the food actually came. Also if you're gonna get anything to drink go with Little Louie's Lemonade soooooooo gooood. 5 STARS !! Can't wait to go back.	5star
My first Sugar Freak experience was nothing less than awesome! I've been trying to get here for brunch but it hasn't happened yet. We wanted to get some good food before bar hopping on Steinway for my friends bachelorette party and just the name of this place alone went with the theme of the night.  My friends were already there when I got there. I joined the table and the server Karen greeted me right away, gave me a few minutes, then took my order. I ordered the Swamp Water cocktail with the chicken fried chicken po boy topped with Mac n cheese with the side salad. Swamp Water is not really strong but it's tasty and I was content....I was gonna be drinking all night. The po boy was good. It was so stuffed that it came apart with every bite. We went around the table tasting everyone's food and everything was just sooooo good. The fried chicken and waffles, the grilled porkchops, the fried catfish, the potato salad.....just amazing.  The food was so good that the girls at my table wanted to know who cooked it. Karen called the chef out and he came to thank us for the compliments. He said his mother-in-law taught him how to cook so well! When he found out this was the beginning of a bachelorette party, he congratulated my friend by bringing us a round of shots.  Karen was so hospitable...she's a great server! Sugar Freak gives splendid service and the food is amazing. You won't be disappointed. I will definitely be back!	5star
I can in the end see why everybody is raving about this location. The fish here is potent and it is seriously the high-quality that i've ever had before. The fish fry used to be potent but the great thing i have tried from this location is the lobster roll. If you're planning on getting one thing from this menu then the lobster roll is it. Straight to the point. High-quality food. Informal and friendly surroundings. The carrier employees is courteous.	4star
FOOD: I've been here a few times and the food was always delicious. The first time I ever went which was a few months ago, there was a hair in my burger. I informed the server and my burger was quickly replaced by the manager. He was able to quickly fix a bad situation. I love the lobster and burger combo. My burger is always cooked to preference and my lobster is always perfect. The fries are always fresh and hot. The garlic sauce is one of my favorite sauces in the world, it literally makes the flavors pop. STAFF: All the waiters I've had were great. They were polite and always started great conversations.  GENERAL: The restaurant is beautiful. The bathrooms are always clean and so is the dining room. The restaurant itself has two dining floors and both are really a piece of art.	5star
The last two times my boyfriend and I visited Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao we were pretty satisfied with the service and the food quality, but third time wasn't a charm.  We came around 2-3PM on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't very crowded, nor busy. They usually give customers a number while they are waiting to be called, but we didn't receive any number until 5-10 minutes at the restaurant.  We sat in a different dining area/section that we typically do. We knew exactly what we wanted to order, so we ordered away. Other customers after us were sitting a few tables away from us too, but they all received their orders faster than we did. We were already starving, but after 15-20 minutes (already 2:30PM-2:45PM) our food still didn't come not even my cold soy milk which doesn't take any time to make, as I've ordered soy milk before.  We flagged down our waitress to ask her about our food and my boyfriend told her that everyone that came at the same time we did or after got all of their food except for us. We tried to flag down someone that appeared managerial, but his back was turned to us most of the time. Our waitress didn't have a real reason as to what caused our food to take forever and she also seemed to be avoiding us. The third or fourth time she came to our table, she brought a plate of garlic cucumbers as a sign of an apology, but it didn't help much and we also didn't eat it. After a 30-45 minute wait, my soy milk and our rice cake, soup dumplings, and scallion pancake finally arrived!  The food was good quality as always, but honestly I lost my appetite after a major delay in our food arriving to our table. I am quite sure that our waitress put in our order late or gave some of our food to another table, as the other customers looked more like tourists.  I used to like coming here for good soup dumplings, but after this service and experience - no more.	2star
I came through Jacob's on a Monday night, the place was not packed but perfect for a nice meal. Jacob's Pickles was something I was really excited to try. The food was good but the service was slacking. There was no smile evident on the server during my entire experience there. The server seemed mad and as if she would much rather be elsewhere instead of providing some better service. You won't feel comfortable or welcomed dining here.  The starters were good portions. The fried pickles were nicely battered and made perfectly but with a mediocre spicy red mayo sauce. The spicy aioli on the street corn was not flavorful enough and the corn did not seem juicy, nor fresh. The corn came on the cob of four and it would be a dish I'd avoid if there is ever a next time. It's inconvenient, no wet naps or anything will help you here. The brussel sprouts were on point and something about the nitrate free bacon blew my mind.  All of their chicken is white meat, the chicken gets battered and fried perfectly, then served hot, tender and juicy over my delicious plate of three gigantic pancakes. Syrup is already poured onto pancakes prior serving. I've had better mac and cheese.  Overall, the food was good but the service was terrible. It wasn't worth the travel, all the way to UWS.	3star
Are they cooking brisket in a pressure cooker????... The brisket was so tough, I thought I was chewing rubber. Not only because of the straight-up brisket, but we also ordered Nachos with brisket which was completely tasteless. Our $100 meal mostly wound up in our garbage can. We ordered extra cornbread, so we would not starve on the way home...and on the way we got pizza from Domino's. I truly doubt that, on the weekend, that these meats are slow cooked...Horrible meal except for CORNBREAD.	1star
"My overall experience was bad. The food was nothing special and the staff wasn't the best.  The waitress I had, a petite white woman in her early 40's, was too busy chatting at the bar to actually do her job. She had a superior attitude, as though she was too good for her job. She would only come to me when I began walking over to her.  The ""fresh"" iced tea I ordered was rancid. When I told the waitress she responded with disbelief stating that ""It cant be, such and such just made this on Saturday"". Hello, its Monday, you call that fresh?! At one point, I spilled ketchup on my shirt and asked for seltzer water. She pretended to not understand what I was saying and instead mocked me for the way I pronounced the word seltzer (which was pronounced correctly). My only regret is not getting the manager involved.  I will not returning."	1star
If you need an excuse to venture out to Brooklyn like I did, you've found it! Juliana's Pizza has an infamously long line for a reason; it is a somewhat quintessential New York experience. Luckily we landed two seats at the bar within 2 minutes of stepping in line, which turned out to be front row seats for how Juliana's makes their pies. The chefs expertly kneads, shapes, tosses, and stretches the dough before putting on toppings and sliding them into the oven. We got the large No.1 Special - mozzarella, scamorza affumicata (Italian milk cheese), pancetta* (italian bacon), scallions and Oregon-grown white truffles in olive oil. It was davvero eccellente! The pancetta tasted fantastic, mixed with a rich white truffle oil base and melting cheeses. My only complaint would be that on top of the oil they already have on the pizzas, they lightly spray more oil on the pizza before serving customers. It just feels too oily to me, but the oil probably gives a lot of flavor to others who like it. It had a homey, authentic Italian vibe. I'd definitely recommend a trek to Juliana's. And if you live close by, I'm forever jealous.	4star
Made a last second reservation at 7:30 but were told we could only stay until 9:00. It wasn't a big issue since the food is serve very promptly and eating tapas with four people means a quick finish. Their menus change often, so we weren't sure what we wanted until we got there. Luckily, out of the many things we ordered, everything was a hit! Their dishes are very interesting with the ingredients and it was surprisingly good and harmonious. I'd come here again and try more stuff, it is just great because the difference in menus makes a large variety of dishes available and allows adventurous people to have something new each visit.  The bill came out to be ~$240 for four, not exactly cheap but we ordered quite a bit! (We ordered more food than shown in pics)	4star
"We went to the Brooklyn location for lunch time pie. Our wait was about 15 minuets. Once we were seated, our waiter arrived quickly to take our drink orders. We ordered the small mushroom pizza. It was more than enough for two people to share. The crust was NY thin, but not cracker thin. It was cooked just right. The sauce and cheese were perfect. This place is nothing fancy, but if you want good NY pizza, the sign outside says it all: ""Furgetaboutit."""	5star
A cute little taco and sandwich place in the midst of Chinatown. There's only enough seating for 15 people, so it can be awkward to go and realize you either have to get take out instead or come back later. The breakroom fries are a must try! They have bacon, dippy egg, pork belly, fries, tater tots, scallions, and jalapeños on them and they are Delish! The tacos were all great, and the breakroom burger was yummmy.	4star
Cute, spacious place, but really subpar coffee--the shot was pulled too long and my latte was bitter as hell.  Generic uninspired baked goods, at least the time I was there. The folks that work here are friendly and pleasant, though, and service was good, so that mitigated the experience but don't think I'll be back.	2star
I've been wanting to come to Traif for a while and finally made it with a friend.  They have a very reasonable tasting menu, $55, but we decided to go a la carte.  The carrots are a must have.  Venison tartare with heirloom tomatoes and blue cheese was a new dish on the menu and great.  The eggplant dish was very tasty but I didn't need for it to be fried.  The gnocchi was excellent.  The gnocchi themselves were good, nothing special, but the mushroom sauce and mushrooms made it a must have dish.  The duck breast was quite good.  We saw so many sliders come out that we decided to get them.  Not special but perfect pulled pork sliders.  It's a cute space.  We sat at the bar which was fun to sit at the kitchen.  They're a well oiled machine.  Servers and staff are friendly.  Pacing is a bit faster than normal, but was good.  My main criticism would be that the sauces, while different, had some similarities, which made it seem a bit repetitive.	4star
This is the second time my wife and I tried Yakitori Totto.  First time was 2009 and we honestly were not that impressed.  Thinking it may have been an off night because of its popularity on Yelp, we decided to give it another try on this trip. We came for a late dinner, but the wait was still about 45 minutes.  We put our names down and waited for a text back while walking around the surrounding blocks, which was fine.  The service was more than adequate for my experience in NYC.  The food is a bit of a let down for the price and kind of more 'upscale' yakitori restaurant.   I get that it's not your side-walk meat on a stick or hole in the wall restaurant.  I get that in NYC, especially mid-town/theatre district/Hell's Kitchen, price is going to be higher.  But even with those considerations, the food just did not match up to the price.  We tried the pork belly appetizer, which was our favorite.  The fried silver fish (a favorite dish when we tried Totto the first time) had too much batter this go around.  We tried the dango and tamago and both were just alright.  We also were not a fan of the several skewers we ordered. Totto does have a great atmosphere, location, pretty good service.  The food just fell short both times for us.  So it's A-OK if you are in the area and willing to pay for the premium.	3star
One of the bigger rip offs in midtown. We went for a team lunch and we all left hungry looking for our next meal after paying $35 dollars each. We ordered the guacamole trio to share for $27 and when it came, we were given three small bowls of guacamole and one small basket of chips. The chips were never refilled or even offered (finding a waiter can be next to impossible). When our food came, the portions are ridiculously small. I ordered a quesadilla and it was good and authentic Mexican food but for $17 it was a huge rip off. The waiters are also totally MIA. We all asked for hot sauce and were given a tiny ramekin of hot sauce to share among 6 of us and when that was gone, again no waiter to be found. Definitely will not be back which is a shame because we work right next door.	2star
I am a huge foodie so this is not easy for me. I came to this restaurant because I really wanted some southern style mac and cheese and barbecue ribs and saw that this was the highest reviewed restaurant and it seemed the most authentic. I ended up ordering the honey chicken (I forgot the name) with 2 sides of mac and cheese. Looking at the menu, the price of a cup of soda or juice was $3-$7 which really threw me off like really how good is your kool aid that it's $5? but whatever I was eating out anyways. I paid $23 for my food which was only 1 piece of chicken (thigh) and 2 4x4x4 pieces of mac and cheese. NOT WORTH IT. The chicken was dry and barely had flavor and the honey was literally poured on top and tasted like some weird cheap honey from the supermarket.  and the mac and cheese also tasted weird. I think they added condensed milk or something because that's all I tasted. And the honey from the chicken mixing with the mac and cheese made it even worst. I did not enjoy eating this and it was not the experience I expected. All I want to know is what is everyone else eating that they are raving about this restaurant?	2star
We arrived ahead of our reservations and were seated within 15 minutes.   The staff is so great with promptness! We had the meatballs with spaghetti with a side of marina sauce for dipping the bread. So good as always!   Our favorite go to spot where there is a Carmines!	5star
Been here twice in the 2 short months I've lived in Sunnyside and I have been more than satisfied each visit.  First time round I had the Alcove burger. Normally I do not like sweet with my meat (avoid BBQ burgers for instance) but this was just fantastic with the pineapple and rosemary sauce. I don't use this term lightly, but it was da bomb.  Skirtsteak lollipops also did not disappoint, though they're more like kebabs than lollipops and were a bit skimpy for a $12 appetizer. But I didn't mind the false advertising when that meat was sliding right off the bone. So tender and juicy.  Second visit I had the 3 tacos and I finished them in about 5 minutes. I am a pig and they were delicious.  Beyond the food, both visits were highlighted by the homey atmosphere and quaint decor. Menu and holiday greetings on a chalkboard lined wall. Not much space, but I think that adds to the neighborhood bar vibes. This place has a really welcoming feel to it and my stomach prognosticates that I will be back for a third meal.	5star
The go to spot for American brunch! Make reservation early in the week or you will be waiting at least an hour or more.  It is a very busy and lively place, but service is on par and attentive.  I love their modern twist on Brunch. I do miss the steak and eggs, but the French toast makes up for it.  Would come here on a sunny Saturday to have brunch before a lovely day shopping in Soho!	4star
The cashier and the front meat-chopper are Latino/na.  Other workers are mixed Mainland Chinese & Latino.  Place is a bit run-down even by New York standard. If they were to rate it like California, the restaurant would probably get a D for cleaness.  It's an order from the counter and go or sit down. You see a sign that says they will kill you if you bring outside food or drinks.  12oz can of soda is $1.19.  Don't have much choice here, so me and my friend ordered that famous Rib and chicken with fried rice and Rib and Fries.  Both order came with Salad in a little Styrofoam cup with thousand dressing with hand ripped pieces of unwashed lettuces. Chicken is dry, one spoon full of the fried rice and you will not have another.  Fries took forever to make guess the sogginess means they don't have the frier on top temperature that day.  Rib is soft and tasteless, I would guess that they water boiled the rib before they BBQ it.  The hot sauce helped, btw, extra hot sauce is $0.30.   Price? I got a to-go for a co-worker across the street for $5.20 that looked and tasted better than what I spend $8.50 for.  Never come again.	1star
WORST customer service we've ever experienced (and we dine out ALOT). Hostess and bar tender were beyond rude. Julian, owner of Beso, Bayou & Blue did not stick by his GC policy of accepting it at all 3 of his restaurants. Obviously, his waitresses need to be re-trained. Will never return here, waited for our apps for over 25 min as well. and few others walked out disappointed. DISGRACE...	1star
For a dinner with some friends in Brooklyn, we chose to visit Pies-n-Thighs. This was my second visit, with the first being a very enjoyable experience. Though pretty busy on a Thursday night, our group (of four) was quickly seated in the overflow seating area at the lower level of the restaurant. We ordered the fried pickle appetizer which was enjoyable, and though seemingly small in quantity, was enough to satiate four hungry guys. I've eaten fried pickles before and always loved the contrast of fried richness and pickled sourness. Add to that a most delectable buttermilk ranch sauce (I usually stay far from any form of ranch sauce), and this appetizer really did the job of getting our appetites ready for our entrees. My friends all ordered variations of the Fried Chicken platters, and they thoroughly enjoyed their dishes, so I can't add too much depth onto their observations. I restrained myself from the Fried Chicken and chose the interesting sounding Fried Catfish platter. The catfish had a lovely fried exterior both crispy and grainy in texture; the later I think attributable to the use of cornmeal in the batter. Beneath this cornmeal cocoon, the catfish was still super moist and tasted as good as any fish; belying this species' bottom-feeding habits and supposed muddy taste. Pies-n-Thighs must have a really good supplier for Catfish! The cornbread side was just okay, and in my opinion could have used a bit more richness (I would love a slice of butter on top). I wound up supplanting the missing richness by scooping up the remainder of our fried pickle appetizer dipping sauce. My garden salad side was fresh and vibrant, but being a standard salad there's not much more to say. I found the side coleslaw delectable with a nice blend of sweetness, sour tang, and also just a little creaminess (I hate heavy mayo based slaws). Also enjoyable was that the slaw was not overly wet; which can happen with lazily prepared slaws as the cabbage should be drained and dried a bit before or after shredding. No dinner is complete without a dessert, so I chose the Chocolate Pudding Pie. Though the pie slice was not large in size, it was large in flavor with a stout chocolate flavor from the thick pudding. The chocolate crust was solid, but didn't add too much as the pudding was clearly the star. The substantial layer of cream was pretty good too; less sweet than expected and contrasted well to the assertive chocolate. Service was excellent as the young man who waited our table was attentive, very friendly, and professional. Everything came out within a reasonable time, in sequence, and as we ordered. Another very good dinner!	4star
"Super cool local joint, with a varied, creative Southern-inspired brunch menu.  The food was good ( i tried the beans and toast)  and the service was also good, BUT (of course there's a ""BUT""...) I couldn't focus on either, since the only thing I was noticing at the time was the condensation steaming from my own mouth.  It was colder inside the restaurant than an industrial walk-in meat locker and just about every patron sitting down was fully kitted up in a hat, coat and scarf while trying to extract some bit of warmth from their rapidly cooling coffees and eggs.  Not sure if the no heat situation is based on policy (as in, please don't linger over your coffee) or whether it was a boiler emergency.  Guys, please work on your heating!!!"	2star
I'm honestly so confused about this high yelp rating, which is what drew my friend and I here for Saturday brunch in the first place. I'll just start with the food.. bland...my steak was hardly seasoned and my breakfast potatoes arrived cold. Extremely underwhelmed...We ordered mimosas they tasted like soap. Almost like the glass had just came out of the dishwasher and wasn't rinsed properly. We sent them back(which I HATE doing) and ordered margaritas, which honestly were just as disappointing. Our waitress was not attentive at all and thats important to me in a dining experience. Out of all the fabulous places in the city to have brunch I'm sad we wasted our time here. I wont be coming back here...ever.	2star
"Let's start with ""MP"" for guacamole... fine, given the variability of avo prices but there was no mention of the cost from the server.  Check comes... $17!!!  Seventeen dollars for a bowl which might have had 2 avos in it?  Really?!!  Didn't stiff the server as it was not her doing, but she should have mentioned.  Rest of the food was passable to good, but clearly, this is not a place to try again in my book."	2star
It is easy to say that this restaurant is my top choice for soup dumplings as of right now. I have been here more times than I can count, and their dumplings have never let me down. In regard to all the other food and service, however, I do have to say that it is definitely not the best I've experienced and was oftentimes disappointing.	4star
I never write reviews but I truly felt compelled to write one for this restaurant. The only positive was the Queso Fundido with the toppings, that's the only reason for the one star. Not surprised that not much has changed with previous bad reviews, food was horrible, AC wasn't working and the service was awful. The waiter had a pompous attitude the entire time. At one point we had to wave him down and interrupt his lengthy conversation with his coworkers so we could get something we had asked for.. When we finally got his attention he waved back and stood there for a few more seconds before he slowly came back to our table. The food was greasy and very salty. The Drink menu was very limited. You're better off going to Chipotle down the block. There needs to be better Mexican in the Heights! First and last time here...	1star
This was a last min. spot to go into to celebrate my b-day. I ordered a Mushroom & cactus salad taco which was really strong. its an acquired taste. (I had to make it vegan comes with sour cream)  3 small tacos comes with one meal and is pretty filling.  My date ordered the fish tacos and was happy with his meal Gave it a 8 out of 10.  It comes with your choice of 4 sauces with different levels of spicy which was fun to play with He also tried a Limeade for the first time which was pretty good.  The ambiance is nice, but to be fair this was a quick stop which is why it has 3 stars. I wish I could have more of there food and drinks to really push it for you but It was nice enough to go back. Be prepared to spend some money and entre could close up to 20 bucks and drinks (alcohol)  are $16 Ill give it another shot xoxo c.	3star
$65 for a pizza??!!  Forgetaboutit.  Plenty of better spots in this great city.  And service is subpar at best.	1star
It used to be very good and I recommended it to my friends. Not anymore....I assume that they have a new chef who trying to mimic Korean food.	2star
Came here for lunch with two of my team. Dimly lit, well decorated, busy restaurant. With sensible lunch prices. My choice would be the - Lunch boxes which you can select a variety of different options.  The food was good. Not worth travelling across Manhattan for, but great if you are hungry and are in the area.  What I thought was standout was the small but highly thoughtful addition of free Mouth wash in the bathrooms, to wash away all that spicy taste - allowing you to return to work fresh. Nice touch.	3star
We had the following: Lamb & bulghur croquettes Fried cauliflower & caper yogurt Chicken with cilantro, root vegetables & almond milk Carrots, hen of the woods, fresh cheese & phyllo Flatbread Flaky bread Tahini Everything was very good.  My wife, who is from Israel, called it upscale Israeli food.  Our favorites were the cauliflower, Carrots, hen of the woods, fresh cheese & phyllo and the breads.  We had no room for desert.  Service was good.  We were there around 6:30 and had no problem getting a table on a Friday.	4star
I went here with high expectations expecting better meatballs than my Italian side of the family makes and was disappointed. I think the idea of this place is cool but it's a bit overpriced for what you end up getting. I would return but I am in no rush to but would recommend for a quick bite.	3star
YAAAAAAAAS! The boil is exactly what we have been looking for. I've seen at least 4 new seafood spots open up in Brooklyn that claim to be a genuine boil spot, but they never do an actual boil. This spot is legit. The price is right, food comes out in a bag, spices are on point, and I leave in a salted coma. I recommend shrimp and crabs in their spicy broth.NOTE: cash only.	5star
Went on a cold night, place was quiet. Aesthetics is lovely, any minimalist would appreciate it. Open kitchen, thank you I have a view of the cute chef. Service- amazing, my waiter was super friendly.  Food. NY Strip (aged)- Cooked perfectly, probably not the best quality (I've been spoiled dating someone who owned a steakhouse) but I ate all of it, including the fat... I'm so excited there's a place to grab a steak now in Dumbo. The pomme lyonnaise and bone marrow and swiss chard were perfect compliments. Escargot- Serve in bowl with sliced mushrooms and butte garlic sauce; I like my in shells; didnt need the other stuff. (Didn't serve it with croutons or bread so we asked and they happily obliged) Beef tartare - not the melt in your mouth I prefer, meat was firm and wanted to taste more shallot and feel the texture of yolk - it's a clean tartare i guess, I want a dirty one- gooey, lots of flavor, etc Brussel sprouts with bacon- tasted heavily of butter (but I'm a fan of butter), bacon is cubed itty bitty, so it more like bacon bits but soft... when i eat bacon, i like it in larger portions so it can play in my mouth. Management- runs a tight ship, dressed to the nine. I will definitely be coming here more often though.	4star
Very rude hostess! I am never going back because of it.  I used to like this place for the food but today I walked out from this place because of this very unprofessional and rude hostess.	1star
The cook here was really aggressive with me. I have no idea what I said or did, but hen was so nasty! Really not cool.	1star
We came. We waited. We are. We left. Nothing to write home about but since it's yelp I'll write about it. This place has great service and great atmosphere and decor. Portions are ok a little on the small side. We were so excited. It was above average. Nothing explosive or extraordinary like other reviews said.  Chickpea and Kale hash with  4/5 - added chorizo it was good and hearty - strong flavors had me burping all day.  Cornmeal pancakes  3.5/5 - great texture with the cornmeal. Needed something else on the plate.  French toast 3/5 - small portion of two bread slices. The dish needed something additional.  Bacon  2/5 - no flavor and for $8 we expected our minds blown.  Coffee 2/5 - basic.  Maybe we ordered wrong? But with the high standard on amazing farm to table fresh and creative brunch menus around the city I'm not sure if this is among them.	3star
"Had read all the complaints and what not circulating on FB, and it's definitely not all true. The service, while not exactly lightning quick, is friendly and extremely considerate - at least our waitress (I believe her name was Savannah) was. If you're in a rush, just tell them and I'm sure you'll get what you need - otherwise, don't go there if you're in a rush. But, to be able to sit at a table with friends, and eat and drink without being harassed, while in a chill environment, why would anyone complain about that? The food is hit and miss. We ordered the ""threesome"" for the table, and it was truly a great appetizer. Interesting flavor, well cooked chicken and pork belly (I didn't try the brisket that was on the dish since I ordered brisket as my main). The mains were inconsistent. My friend and I ordered the half-pound of brisket and received three nice size pieces ... one completely dry and over cooked (not an ounce of fat on it), the second had a little fat and was a bit better, while the third piece left me wishing I had a platter filled with that one piece. BBQ sauce should've been on the side to control the amount, but that was my fault for not asking for that.  My wife and her friend had the pork shoulder, which, from what I tasted, was as dry as could be. The corn bread was really good, the fries (I heard) were very good, the slaw was refreshing and the salad I ordered in place of the fries was very good, too. Outside of the inconsistencies with the food, the only issue we had was sitting at the table in the corner at the edge of the bar, directly under a vent - it was FREEZING! The manager did come over to ask us if we were OK with it, which was extremely nice of him to do, and, at that moment, we were fine ... but, as the night went on, it became unbearable.  All in all, we will keep going back to Queens Bully. If anything, it's a great bar in the area with decent food (we'll just find out which dishes hit the spot and which ones to avoid) and games on the TV. What else do you need?"	3star
Who doesn't like Habana Outpost? Like, for real?  Whenever i'm in town, i'm all too happy to stuff myself with their rice and beans. Wrap it up nicely with a few cups of their spiked lemonade, and i'm good for an evening of shenanigans. Their outdoor space is nice if you're looking to be social and loud; and their indoor space is good if you want a mellow space for a date or a nice chat with a friend.  Why not 5 stars? Cuz the germophobe in me won't let me live. The straw dispenser releases straws that are not wrapped, and no shade to the lovely young ladies manning the bar, but if you're handling money and whatever else, i don't need your albeit beautifully manicured but germy hands touching the top of my straw. Not exactly sanitary. In addition, while i realize that they're going for the whole cantina vibe, containers where all the patrons on the planet must stick their hands in to get their preferred forks and spoons just makes me think of all the superbugs that emerge like once a year and they're often traced back to some place where too many people are sharing too many germs.  So, if you can get past some of these aforementioned reservations and you're craving some Latin-inspired food in a jovial setting, Habana Outpost just might be the spot for you.	3star
Great place. Excellent selection of beers and a nice simple tasty menu. My burger was great and my wife had the clam roll which was also fantastic. The fries rule too. We'll be back!	5star
We came to this restaurant by a friend's recommendation. Looking up the restaurant on Instagram someone had claimed this to be the best ramen place in nyc.  I was naturally skeptical but felt a strong urge to check it out for myself. The entrance is very unassuming with a dark red lamp in front of a narrow small door. Honestly the red light on a dark street on Sunday night gave the entrance kinda a creepy feeling. Not a big fan, but hey I'm not here to eat the lamp. We were prepared to wait after reading other reviews. The place was a bit small and there were already a few groups sitting on the benches around the restaurant. However the wait wasn't long. Maybe about nine minutes.  Their special Mu Ramen is limited to only twenty bowls a day, and was already sold out when I tried to order. (That's pretty gimmicky in my opinion)  We settled for tonkotsu and spicy miso ramen.   Service was a bit lackluster but our waitress was polite and courteous enough. Normally I don't except anything other than getting our glasses of water filled in a ramen place anyways, so it wasn't a big deal. The tonkotsu ramen, for some weird reason, came with very thing noodle. The texture is a bit more bouncy than soumen noodle but otherwise I would have thought they literally put soumen in a ramen bowl.  The soup was surprisingly light for tonkotsu. At first I thought the soup was too thin, but after a few more tastes I realized they probably skimmed off more fat off the soup so it's less greasy. I also noticed the soup is less salty and less msg than most other tonkotsu ramen you could get in nyc. The additions in the ramen were okay.  Chasu pork meat is super tender but isn't flavored too strongly but it goes well with an overall lighter tasting version of tonkotsu.  The onsen egg I ordered additionaly to go with the ramen is a bit too well done for my taste and didn't contribute anything to the ramen.  I would recommend skipping it.  Overall I liked the soup quite a bit but the noodle kinda destroyed the balance of the ramen for me.  I seriously wish they give the choice of the type of noodle when we ordered instead of giving the extra thin noodles as default. The spicy miso ramen came with udon thickness noodle. The noodle is a bit bouncier than actual udon but while I kinda resented the extra thickness, it does taste better than the extra thin one they serve with tonkotsu.  The soup itself is flavored with miso, the fermented soy paste, and made spicy.  I am a fan of the miso they use because the flavor is rich but not overpowering.  However I think the stock they use is a bit too thin, so unfortunately the soup tasted a little like hot water diluted spicy miso soup.  They serve minced meatball instead of chasu in the spicy miso ramen, which I find regrettable.   Overall, I do appreciate Mu Ramen's lighter flavor take on the tonkotsu and miso ramen.  It's a refreshing change from the usual ultra greasy/salty/heavy ramen. However, I strongly disagree with their arbitrary choice of noodles in both of the ramen.  I'm sure they have good reason to pair the extra thin noodle with tonkotsu then the extra thick noodle with the spicy miso but for me the noodles became a huge distraction from otherwise nice bowls of ramen.  If I ever come back here again i'd certainly request different thickness of noodles in the ramen.	3star
Each dinner experience starts off with a bread and a bean paste (?) served to each table. I liked the chewiness of the bread, but the spread could have used more salt. We ordered a ceviche, a fish dish and the paella. Everything was great! I think I liked the fish the best. The ceviche was kind of generic but decent. And the paella was normal--I felt it could have used more seafood but still appetizing.	4star
I don't understand the great reviews. Went for brunch this summer and got mediocre Eggs Florentine and dry French Toast. An Airbnb guest of mine reported back that the steak was terrible and another set of guests told me they got food poisoning from the fish. Maybe they get high marks for generous portions?	1star
Went here for a restaurant week dinner. Really popular and busy - a bit too stuffy and noisy, but maybe it won't be so bad once restaurant week is over. We tried the pork and brussel sprouts salad which was delicious - beautifully charred sprouts! The khao soi was rich, spicy and creamy, the pork belly was cooked perfectly but came in a bowl full of gravy that was too salty. Loved the runny egg in it though! The coconut rice accompaniment is so flavorful - make sure you try that! The ribs were average, but the coconut cod was tasty. For dessert skip the Turin and get the Halo halo!	3star
This establishment is the rudest staff that has ever treated my girlfriend and I.  We had menus taken forcefully from our hands after mentioning we only wanted drinks and not food.  From there, we attempted to sit at a stool at the bar and a staff member told me only guests were allowed to sit. Not to mention, there was an entire row of stools available and the restaurant was probably a 1/3 full at the time.  We walked out after being treated like this.  They should get a new staff or treat their customers with more respect, otherwise they won't have ANY return customers.  Sad!	1star
"Anthony Bourdain approved as ""authentic""...Sorry, but you can't trust a white guy to tell you if Chinese food is ""authentic"" or not. Meet a new chinese friend.  My friend insisted on coming to Hop Kee, so I fought the BQE to come out here. This place is definitely ""Americanized"". You can tell because they have sugar on the table for your tea. I can't believe my friend dared to put sugar in her tea right in front of me. LOL. For the price they charge, I swear, there are better ""truly authentic"" foods elsewhere. I have been craving Peking Style Pork Chops for the longest time and it's just awful here. The batter covering of the pork chops was soo thick and hard...it was disgusting. I was hoping for a softer and more chewy texture. Their crabs (Canto style) was ok but it was too salty for my liking. The portions are decent and they're opened late on weekends (till 4am). Great if you're a drunken hot mess, but otherwise...go somewhere better for Chinese food."	2star
Rustic, candle lit Italian Upper East Side staple, where the food embodies authentic Italian fare for affordable prices. My only qualm is that you'll essentially be rubbing shoulders with the party next to you, after an inevitable wait. We started with the truffle oil paper thin Sardinian flatbread which was good, although not much too it. We then went with the polenta tartufata which was very good (polenta filled with cheese and black truffle sauce). As our mains we went with the eggplant gnocchi which were both very good. I'd suggest popping in on a weekday evening, as it may not be as busy.	4star
"Holy Moly Baloney. This place is more crowded than a club on Thursday night in a small college town. Wow, It wasn't shoulder to shoulder it was chest to butt formation going into this popular restaurant. Food: Corned beef and Pastrami fresh is always amazing. With the wait and the amount of people there, I was hoping for the taste to be like the second coming of Christ...it wasn't. I'm sad to tell the masses of hordes that are dying to visit this historical Hollywood picture establishment that the meat was...meat. It tasted like the corned beef you get from an Irish pub and the reuban you get at that Jewish deli on the corner of your street. So come here for the Instagram otherwise go to your hometown deli and get a hot sandwich without waiting for an hour. Ambience: This is what I'd like to call a tourist attraction with a mandatory food policy. Harry Met Sally here need I say more. Expect pushing and no seating.  Price: The most expensive deli you will ever order from. It cost around 25 for 1 sandwich no cheese, not toasted no saurkraut. Just a pickle and a sandwich with about a quarter pound of meat. Come to this ""Attraction"" ready to blow some dough on the standard deli sandwich and some entertaining meat slicers."	2star
We should have known when we walked into the restaurant and had to stand at the entrance for five minutes before being acknowledged that it was not going to go well.  The restaurant was fairly empty - only 3 tables filled and two servers on the floor but we had to stand and wait. It's been an hour and 10 minutes and we have yet to receive the second appetizer. So, we are leaving. We are hungry and will now go in search of a restaurant that will actually serve the food we ordered. Run, don't walk to another Greek restaurant. Unless, of course, you have all night.	1star
I made a reservation for 4 and we arrived with three people and we arrived 10 mins early. I made the hostess aware that there was a slight possibility that the 4th person would not show up, but we would like to be seated at the time of the reservation and we would proceed without our dinner. We were asked to take a seat and a few mins later the Mgr told us that he would seat us, but that he would need the table at 8:30 sharp bc of other reservations. He said it again to me, and said he would ask us to leave at 8:30. I expressed to him that I was uncomfortable with him chasing us out and we hadn't even sat down to eat yet. He then told the hostess to seat us at a different table (next to the kitchen). We proceeded to order and the last person in our party showed up within 10 mins and joined our table. We ordered over $200 worth of food and at 8:35 the same manager came to our table and asked us for the table.  I can honestly say that the food was good and our server was attentive; however, I will not go back based on the poor service from the manager. I have never been chased out of a restaurant, the way I was here.	2star
"Went back to Babbo after several years.  The hype was gone, and unfortunately the magic was also gone.  From the moment we walked in before the dinner rush time of 6pm, things were just ""fine"" but not on par with other restaurants in the category.  As for the food, I enjoyed the tongue appetizer and cuddle fish.  The appetizer was better.  But my husband's lamb was rather dry, which was very disappointing.  The wait staff was fine, but again it somehow missed anything to make anything stand out or memorable.   The only exception was their sommelier lady who listened to everything we said and made excellent recommendations."	3star
I can't begin to tell you how excited I am that this restaurant has found its way into my life. I had dinner there last night with a friend and we had a wonderful time, left full, and didn't feel like we broke the bank. It's unreal to have affordable good size portions of seafood for the prices they have but it was wonderful because we got to share 4 dishes: tuna tartare, uni (sea urchin), squid salad and fettuccini with clams. All the dishes were presently beautifully and the service was so kind and helpful. Can't wait to go back!!	5star
Really loving this backyard bar- if only it weren't so far. Beautiful lush backyard complete with two koi ponds, turtles, and a little stream. Nautical themed, wooden interior, fish tank with exotic fish (including one that may have been fed fish food crack... swimming frantically, non-stop, from end to end for a solid 30 minutes plus), chain linked bar seats, sketches of mythical sea witches. There's a nice line-up of beers and service is friendly. Thought it was smart having the bar food stand in a separate, cordoned off section- menu looked great, unfortunately was too full at the time to try anything.  Watch out for the blackberries splattered all over the backyard- not much to be done when there's a giant sprawling blackberry tree in the backyard. Just don't wear anything you mind getting stained!	4star
We Went to Grazie for brunch yesterday.  The brunch pre-fix for $24 doesn't even include coffee and absolutely no substitutions.  The omelet came with a small salad.  They burned one of the pancakes and They made sure we did not eat it by taking it away before they gave us a new one.  We were very disappointed with the decor.  It looks like a very small diner than a restaurant with those prices.  There is definetely no reason to go back.	2star
What a lucky find! I could not ask for a better place anytime of the day, but at 930 at night after a long flight from LAX to be able to enjoy Drunken Fish Soup and a few shots with the people that run the place, I am a lucky human.  I am going back next time I am anywhere near NYC!	5star
I'm kind of a weekend carnivore. That is, I behave and eat my veggies, seafood and legumes throughout the week, and let loose on the weekend.  So when I'm ready to eat meat, I want it to be really special and worthwhile.  Hometown definitely makes the cut.   A group of us recently split some Jerk half rack, Korean glazed baby back, and some pulled pork tacos.  We added some collard greens and potato salad as well.   All of it was very tender and tasty. The Korean glaze with the fired garlic and scallions were particular hits at our table.  There was some beer as well, but, honestly, I was paying more attention to the tender and flavorful meat, so I can't remember which ones they were.  This is undoubtedly the best BBQ option in southern Brooklyn. Sure, it's not the most accessible, but definitely worth the effort to get there,	4star
"Here's the review I should've written:  We went to Seed on a weekend afternoon because Miriam was packed. This place was relatively empty.  We were not impressed at all. The drinks were expensive for not freshly squeezed. Perhaps it was because it was lunch time - but the food was mediocre, the portions lacking, and the prices far too generous. As frequent diners of the cuisine, we would not recommend. Apparently the menus we were given were incorrect - so that error might, to some extent, bridge what we expected and what we got.  1 star.  ------ Update after your response:  While I have absolutely no problems being corrected, I will stick with my initial review. Snarky responses are really fun, but they don't mean much.  If your juices are indeed not out of a carton, I would suggest serving them in their original bottles. Restaurants often do that so people don't assume they are fresh. I also don't think it's unreasonable for diners to expect fresh juice at $5 a pop, but maybe that's just my opinion.  There were no grill marks on your lamb, but I guess I was wrong. I stand corrected. Maybe I was unable to tell because there was so little of it on my plate. Was I wrong about the white-meat-chicken-thighs? - you didn't respond to that part. Here's the review you think would be more respectable: Your food is mediocre, your juices taste bad, your prices are expensive, and your portions are lacking. Bonus opinion: Your response to criticism was defensive and judgmental. ------ I don't usually review restaurants on yelp, but this place is exceptionally bad. I have no idea why it's so well rated.  The $5 ""organic juices"" are straight out of the Tropicana box. The $21 ""charcoal grilled lamb"" is not charcoal grilled. The $18 ""chicken thighs"" are white meat.  Deceptive, mediocre and expensive. One star is too many."	1star
I recently brunched at Extra Virgin in celebration of my friend's Bachelorette weekend.   I had the Virgin Frittata with roasted tomato, arugula, and basil pesto.  It was a well-executed dish, but not good enough to have me coming back.  I do have to admit that they do an awesome Banana French Toast with caramelized bananas and whipped mascarpone.  Too sweet as an entree, but perfect as an appetizer to share with your other suga-lovin friends. Decent portions and fairly priced- Extra Virgin works well for a nice, casual brunch.	3star
The restaurant name is a noodle village, but the congee is the best food here. Any type of congee is great and sharing xiao long bao with your friends is also nice.	4star
Bottomless brunch is where it's at! I made a Saturday brunch reservation through Yelp, and we were seated immediately once we arrived. Bottomless brunch is $45 and includes an assortment of boozy brunch cocktails and endless small plates. Being a 2 hour brunch, we decided we'd try as much as we could in that time frame.  Let's start with cocktails. There are 6 different options to choose from, and my table tried them all. The classic mimosa is good, but I preferred the blushing mimosa which was mixed with pineapple and pomegranate juice. The Morning After is a classic Bloody Mary, but it was a little too spicy for my tastes. My boyfriend enjoyed the Carpe Diem, which is essentially a Screw Driver (vodka/orange juice) that packs a punch with the addition of absinthe!  Overall the food was pretty good. For our table of two, the waiter suggested ordering 3 plates at a time. Our absolute favorite was the brioche French toast- it was so good, we ordered a second plate of it! The only major let down was the eggs benedict. The hollandaise sauce was so tart due to excessive lemon, it was pretty much inedible. We also liked the smoked salmon, the breakfast potatoes, and the house ricotta.  We enjoyed our experience at Bea and I would definitely recommend it for people looking for a fun brunch experience. The restaurant is beautifully done and I thought the price was reasonable for unlimited food and beverage service. It can get crowded on the weekends, so go early or make reservations ahead of time!	4star
Came here today for Easter.  Absurdly expensive fixed menu, extremely mediocre and bland food. The hot antipasti had five different elements to it: spinach pie (a square of microwaved spinach) eggplant rollatini (canned sauce) a stuffed mushroom, a stuffed pepper, and some unidentifiable cheesy puff. However, each was all so tasteless that I couldn't distinguish one from the next.  The veal marsala was stringy, the sauce thin and not tasting even vaguely of wine. The mushrooms were like rubber. It might as well have been a microwaved lean cuisine.  The chocolate cake was still half frozen when I got it.  To add insult to injury, almost $80 per person and we didn't even drink alcohol.  Utter trash.	1star
"This was my first time at Sugar Freak since they reopened. I decided to give them a chance in the new location, having never been impressed in the old location.  The food could have been 3 stars except the place shoots itself in the foot left and right. So we started off with the Chips and the Calamari. Calamari was great. The Chips tasted good, but for $6 bucks we got maybe 10 potato chips. Really?!? My brother tried to order crawfish, but they were out. I tried to order chicken and beignet waffles, but they don't make those yet. How long have you been open and you still aren't making things printed on the menu? So we are irritated to find out that we can't get what we wanted on a slow Saturday night. So I get chicken with a regular waffle. The waffle was under cooked and the chicken was bland. They didn't give butter and the syrup had no flavor, just a boring meal.  My brother got snow crabs, this is where it is interesting. He asked for drawn butter. They said ""it's already on the crab"". THE CRAB IS IN A SHELL. So Sugar Freak decides to make the shells of their crabs gross and slippery to make it a disgusting experience to remove the shells of the crab, only for none of the butter to get on the meat because it's on the freaking shell! SMH. Just a dumb decision and a waste of money.  Overall, Not worth it. Never again."	2star
came here with two friends for dinner on saturday night. we expected a wait so put our names down (they text you when the table is ready) and then went next door to the irish bar for some drinks. we maybe waited 45 mins for our table. per other reviewers, this place is small, but quick on getting the food out!  we started with the dumpling special and spring rolls. the dumplings had chicken and crab in them, solid. i dont really understand what ppl like about spring rolls, but my friend requested we order, so whatever. really just a vessel to dip in that sweet red sauce.  for entrees we shared pad see ew, the chili shrimp, and another special of the day which was a type of beef curry with a variety of veggies and a really nice red spicy broth. the special also came with white rice and a crab omlette on top- it was so good!  we all agreed the pad see ew really stole the show, those were some awesome noodles. everything here is super affordable. we imbibed in a $32 bottle of malbec woo!	4star
I first have to start out by saying I really wanted to give this place 4 stars but I sadly couldn't get myself to do it. I was excited to try this legendary place after hearing that it received awards 26 years straight. I came in on a Wednesday night for my reservation at 10 pm. It was lively and crowded with the feeling that there were a lot of locals and regulars. It was a little chaotic as we waited another 10 minutes to get seated. We sat down to eat and they set up our table with water and bread. Bread was nice and warm with a side of butter. It came with a variety of onion bread in different sizes. We ordered the steak for 4 with a side of German potatoes and cream of spinach. They gave us 2 huge ribeyes to share family style and the 2 sides to share. We also got 2 big pieces of thick bacon to share among the 4 of us.  The ribeye was cooked perfectly. We ordered medium rare and ive never had a steak cooked they perfectly. This was my favorite part by far. Man was it juicy and soft in the middle with an outside Chad that mixed perfectly together. Sadly I was not as excited about the flavor. It was not as seasoned as I liked and did not have as much flavor as my steak from Flemings. It was a a decent amount to share among 4 of us but i wish they gave us a little more for the price we paid.  The thick bacon was really juicy. It had a really good flavor and the pieces were huge. Almost reminded me of a thick slice of pork belly except a crispier texture. The spinach and German potatoes were honestly pretty average. I didn't really love them and would not necessarily get them next time. The spinach was better at house of prime rib in San Francisco.  We ordered dessert which was their homemade whip cream in a Sunday. Tons of chocolate drizzled over the ice cream and whip cream. It also had peanuts. The whip cream was definitely worth ordering in the end despite being full. They also gave us chocolate coins to take home with us.  Overall, I paid around $85 total each. Pricey for what you get. I can get a better meal at Ruth chris or flemings instead of going all the way to New York. I was sadly disappointed, but I had to confirm what a lot of people have been feeling for a while, this place is going down hill.	3star
It is a really nice spot that is super cheap. I had a lobster cheese fries which was very good. I was surprised about how much lobster I had. It is a really great place to visit.	5star
"A solid ""meh"". The food is not bad, but when you're paying $11-14.50 for a Bun (vermicelli noodle bowl) or $7 for 6 dumplings, you need a little bit more value.  The roasted pork Bun I got was not bad, but not great. The pluses: good amount of pork, decent flavoring The minuses: the lettuce in it did not feel fresh. If you're gonna charge fru-fru level prices for this dish, throw some fru-fru level veggies in there.  The dumplings were edible, but you could tell they were just reheated store-bought frozen dumplings. The skin was rice based so it tasted dim-sum-ish. The flavoring was off, too much pepper in them or something. For 1.50 more you can get a plate of better tasting, handmade dumplings from La Salle AND have a place to sit. The boba here is not good, though it can definitely satisfy a craving in a fitting a square peg in a circle sort of way.  So, this is a delivery joint that charges sit down prices. Not bad, I suppose, but not great either. The search for good Vietnamese food in Manhattan continues."	2star
stopped by before going to a concert at barclays on a saturday night. good crowd, nice round bar with seating on both sides but hard to order a drink if all the seats were taken.  enjoyed the environment and great house cocktails. i had two and the secret garden was my favorite. three stars because my first drink was unfortunately poured quite short and one of the bartenders could be more friendlier and attentive.	3star
HORRIBLE service. First night in the NYC and had decent hopes... Service took forever, and the server didn't seem to care that the wings were too spicy and I disliked both of my drinks. She never asked if everything was ok, and never checked on us.  I had the chicken tacos... They were ok. Friends had the burger, bun was falling a part and was dry. Mac and cheese was good... Duck fat fries were yummy. Pork chop decent. bacon wrapped dates were good. Back booth in the corner was freeeeezing. Air conditioner vent blowing right on our booth... Making our group uncomfortable and cooling the food off way fast.  Disappointed.	2star
The food is good  - I like their version of jerk chicken, sample the wings as an appetizer. I do feel that are slow even thow they have 15 people walking around trying to look busy	3star
"One of the worst and rudest places I have ever been to!! Me and some folks were working in the area and needed a place to warm up a bit (we were working outside). After buying a load of coffees and snacks, we were then told by the owner that we were not welcomed and that we had to leave since we were taking up too much room?!? I understand wanting room for your regulars but the place was empty?!? So I guess the motto of the place is ""spend your money here BUT after that, unless I like you, get the hell out"". I guess it's all about catering to her ""exclusive"" clientele and the rest can be swept out like trash!!"	1star
Really delicious Mediterranean food.  It's a sharing plates kind of place so the best idea is to get lots of little things to share.  They make everything in house - including the bread which was amazing.  We had the grilled mackerel, Bulgarian Feta, Tomato, Onion & Za'atar and Brik Pastries - all of which were great.  If you like fish and don't mind picking out the bones, I would recommend the mackerel.	4star
Dinner was amazing, fresh and simple (in the best way). Lovely atmosphere and great cocktails.	5star
Lousy. Overpriced, overcooked, and terrible service. The burger was  well done, when we said rare. The server barely spoke English. The space was cramped. Don't.	1star
Five star for the food and ambiance. 1 star for service and everything else. Basically the server doesn't care who is on the list waiting outside. She never come outside to tell people your table is ready. After one hour waiting outside without seeing her come out calling anybody's name, we went inside to see. Whenever an empty table open, whoever stands inside and bugs her gets it. Finally sit down and waiting for food, she asked around every table who got the jumbo shrimp(which we picked big ones and pay for it already). One table said they got it, so they got our shrimp. Another 45 min waiting in the chaos since waiter doesn't know who gets what. It is a stressful place if you don't fight for it and don't speak Greek. We would much rather prefer go somewhere else that at least we know there is a waitlist for seating, and whatever you order would come to you.	2star
Came here with s/o and his sister. Came in around 5:30, was told to wait 40 minutes, waited 20 minutes instead.  What we ordered, APPETIZERS -papaya mango salad (was OK) heaps of cilantro in it, I love cilantro but felt like it overpowered the salad.  -fried calamari (SKIP) wasn't as good as I expected. The batter was odd, the sauce that came with wasnt our thing.  -Mac n cheese (was OK) was alright.  -catfish basket (MUST GET) came with 3 pieces of yummy breaded fried catfish. Delishhhh.  -soft crab basket (SKIP) there were only 2 tiny crabs with a side of French fries. I would pass.  MAIN COMBO A 1lb shrimp and 1lb crawfish Got the boil special, spicy. Should have gotten FIRE but didn't wanna risk it but next time we know to get it.  This was the BEST thing I've eaten probably this entire month. The sauce was BUTTERY, GAR(LICKY) and had a hint of spice. MMM. There were pieces of garlic just floating around in the sauce. Everything was perfect about this. MUST GETTTT. I might come back for the lobster next time.	5star
Stopped by here for happy hour before dinner. Unfortunately I wanted oyster and cocktail happy hour, but oyster happy hour is only on Mondays. We ended up getting whiskey ginger and whiskey sour, I thought we'd get house whiskey for it to be included in the happy hour deal but we were charged for jack daniels. Unfortunately, we didn't get the happy hour I expected. But one good thing out of it was how smooth oure drinks were made, just enough whiskey and mix that neither one overwhelmed each other.	3star
"I cannot believe the reviews that I'm reading...I was there with my wife the other night, not knowing anything about the rest...it looked adorable from the outside...we went in and asked for a table..they immediately sent us to the Siberian basement.....The menu is very limited with only burgers and Pizza...we were in the mood for a Burger and the hostess and the waitress said the burger is ""amazing and life changing""... We ordered the $26 burger (figuring at that price it should have fine ingredients and be special......it was the  WORST BURGER I have ever had.....it tasted like a double burger at MacDon.( at 10x the price)..I WILL NEVER GO BACk THERE....AND SUGGEST  YOU DON'T GO!!!"	1star
Came here for the Restaurant Week dinner. It was prix-fixe 42 for the dinner. FYI they request that the whole table participate, although one of my friends did get something off the regular menu.  I tried the raw red snapper appetizer, the branzino main, and the chocolate cake. One of my friends had the creme fraiche cheesecake, which I tried of course. And another friend had  duck & foie gras ravioli, of course I tried this as well.  The star of course was the complimentary bread basket. It included stars like stromboli bread, cheese and meat cooked inside a turnover yumm. The bread also came with  dips; including eggplant, mascapone butter, and oil. This really helped fill us up since the rest of the dishes were not as starch heavy.  Raw red snapper= light, overall okay but nothing mind blowing.  Branzino= I really liked that the skin was crispy, that really added to the flavor. It seemed like maybe something was missing in the sauce, overall good but could have been better.  Chocolate cake (with salted caramel gelato, chocolate butterscotch)= I really liked this. It wasn't too overwhelmingly sweet like some chocolate cakes can be. The mix with gelato really balanced out the sweetness.  Creme fraiche cheesecake ( with pear compote, praline gelato, and crispy meringue)= the crispy meringue were really tasty and the praline gelato was good as well. Otherwise the actual cheesecake was just okay.  Duck & foie gras ravioli= this was tasty and I liked the duck and foie gras, however I couldn't really separate out those tastes from the whole dish. Honestly I would have had a hard time noticing that this ravioli had foie gras in it if it wasn't listed in the ingredients.  Service= very attentive and friendly.  Overall, this was a satisfying Restaurant Week find.	4star
What crappy service here. I am a born and bred NY'er and live and work in Tribeca, and come here all the time. Whenever I have friends or international clients come into town, I always recommend or I bring them here! Ummmm, NOT ANYMORE! This place is totally cute and the food is decent, but the service here SUCKS. They are pretentious and don't have a clue, while they charge you for $13/15 drinks. I have no problem paying any amount if the service and quality is good, but not so here. I got here with a friend around 4:45pm on Saturday, and our waiter informed us they weren't serving any food until 6pm, but they would have a small bar snack menu at around 5pm....so we ordered a bottle of wine, and around 5:15, he came back over and we were able to order some pate w/bread. It was all good, until he came over at 6 and asked us to pay him now cuz he was leaving and the shift was changing. So okay, we paid him +20% tip......and the new staff comes on. We finish our bottle of wine and meantime order our actual dinner......plus more wine....plus dessert.......chick comes over and gives us our bill around 9:30 after we finish our dessert......we asked for water cuz she never asked us if we wanted water or coffee or tea or anything. We pay the bill, +20% tip.....she FINALLY brings us friggin water after we are parched, lol.......2 seconds after she puts it down and we're drinking it, dude bar back comes over and takes it away!! We're like, ummmm we were actually in the middle of drinking that! And he's like oh, we need this table cuz people are waiting for it. WTF. He proceeds to clear our table when my friend is still finishing her glass of wine, he puts silverware and new fresh glasses down. And we call him over, and we say by the way.....we've been here paying for food and wine since 4:45pm before you even came here. And we actually paid that guy already before and now we're paying again,and you're not going to let us finish our wine or water??? What gives?? He proceeds to throw the waitress under the bus and says she's the one who is complaining about it. What the f*ck?? That's bull sh*t. So next time, I'll just take my wallet across the street to LOCANDA VERDE where they actually know what good service is, and the food and drinks are much, much better and worth the cost. Screw you Smith and Mills.  Sincerely, former loyal patron	1star
I'd say stick to entrées if you want your order to arrive warm. Otherwise stick to going there yourself.	3star
Food was amazing and service even better! Sampled a bit of everything and the flavors were so unique and delicious! Definitely will be back soon.	5star
Was unpleasantly surprised by my last Visit. Usually is awesome but www stuck with waitstaff who were clearly unhappy at serving us. Not cool	2star
"The good: The service deserves an A+. The staff went above and beyond to go over their menu and to make us feel taken care of.  The bad: We ordered the mansour platter (katsu, curry over rice, kimchi fried rice, hamburger steak, small salad / pickles) and the ""egg in heaven"". The egg in heaven dish was bland and the highlight of the dish was not the creaminess that is promised in the description or the eggs in the name, but the garlic bread- that's not a good sign. The platter was okay, but nothing to write home about, although the yuzu dressing used for the salad offered a nice zesty kick to an otherwise bland meal. The donkatsu sauce was chunky and had a gritty texture (why?????), the tomato sauce we opted for with our hamburger steak made it taste like a meatloaf, the curry strayed just a hair too far from traditional japanese curry (i think they used an additional spice to make things interesting), the kimchi fried rice was pretty flavorless (BUT THE EGG ON TOP WAS SO CUTE! lol)... Lastly, this is more a small logistical detail but why is the platter that this combo is served on so high? It was uncomfortable to both eat off of and to serve onto a separate plate off of....  The ambiance is cute, but I'm not sure if Joah is trying to make it as a bar or a restaurant. The food isn't exactly bar food, but it seems like their soju cocktails are really something special (unfortunately, I was not drinking this evening so I can't comment).  I wanted to like it because of the stellar service from start to finish, but it was a buzzkill in terms of the food. I won't be back unless it's my only option... and we know that won't be the case in the Korean food mecca that is Flushing.  Perfect for: casual dinner with friends, drinks on a quiet weeknight.  Tips: (a) they don't offer a dessert menu but they do give you Trident gum with your check- i thought this was super cute! (b) if you do try the egg in hell or egg in heaven dish, feel free to ask for more bread/crackers- they are more than happy to give you a refill! :)"	2star
dank nudes  this is the best noodle plave ever  get knife pulled hp with mad cilantro and sauce do ittttt do it the table sauce its on the table	5star
Went here for some tacos and we were not disappointed! We had the sampler platter and breakroom fries. For the sampler platter, you get to order 3 tacos. We ordered the chicken, steak, and fish. All of them were super delicious! A bit overpriced, but it is New York. The french fries were also delicious! Definitely unique and seasoned well! I loved that the restaurant had a wall full of hot sauces of many variety.  As for the place, it was super small. A literal hole in the wall. We were walking up and down the street looking for the restaurant because it was squeezed right in the middle of other stores. The restaurant is a bit dark and there isn't much space to eat if it's crowded. Overall, I recommend trying this place! If you don't know which tacos to get, definitely try the platter! If you're going with friends, get the breakroom fries to share!	4star
Wait is long for overrated Japanese fast food. Don't order the sashimi starter... Subpar fish but the salmon, fluke and octopus were decent. However, I'm certain they are not consistent.  An underground, dank cavern set up, Mew is best for college crowds after a night of drinking... Or before. We were famished so everything tasted fine, but not notable. Service was existent but it was just overall, too loud, too dark and messy.  The kimchi udon was creamy and different. Yakitori was ok given that I generally prefer noodles out of a bag to the thick hand spun kind. Chicken katsu, miso ramen- no, just don't. Side dish oily rice- depends how much of a rice lover you are.  While the texture was good, the flavor was blander than bland. Kani cream croquette, takoyaki squid and baby octopus were good... But what kind of fried to table food isn't? The Only stand-out tapa was the salmon avocado mini tacos. They were luscious and a very smart flavor combo- I would attempt to recreate this one at home.  Would I come again? Sure. It's the type of no brainer, late night snack spot. But the city is full of them, (Sake bar hagi- noisier, longer wait, better, Oh Taisho- not better), but if I were in Herald Square with nowhere to go, then, yes. There are enough variety to try something different each time. Would I recommend it? Nope.	2star
"Kimchi Grill opened my eyes to what I thought was impossible - f***ing up Korean Tacos. In fact, I feel ashamed and uncomfortable even calling these ""Korean"" tacos. Kim Jung Un wouldn't wish this kimchi on his worst American enemies, but I guess the hipsters actually managed to make this happen.  The ""kimchi"" they use is horrendous, you can tell it's very old and sour, and not the good kind of sour you want from kimchi.  They do make them look very appetizing and instagramable, so if that's all you care about, try it once I guess."	1star
"Excellent from start to finish! Went for the ""Afrika Bambaattaa"" which consisted of fried whitings along with the 2 sides of mac & cheese + candy yams. The fish was hot and freshly fried. The batter wasn't too overwhelming. Fish wasn't too fishy. Good overall balance. The sides were quite a delicious mix as well! The cornbread was my least favorite, it was traditional and lacked flavor. Tasted as if it came out of a jiffy mix box. Friends of mines ordered chicken, waffles and fish all of which they enjoyed. A couple of the most interesting things about this restaurant would have to be the murals on the walls along with the creative menu item names which are of famous African American figures. Service was good, everyone was very friendly and the food came out fast. No indoor waiting area so you can expect to wait outside as your table is prepared. While I must say Sylvias is still my favorite soul food spot in Harlem, Amy Ruth's is a very close second. You will not be disappointed if you give it a try!"	4star
I guess the place is cool/ hip but not worth the money. Definitely go if you want mediocre food.  We ordered the beef pho ($17)thinking it's going to be out of this world.. sadly no, super underwhelming especially since they use Pad Thai noodles instead of rice vermicelli noodles. The pho broth is darker, more seasoned than your average beef pho which I thought was too rich. The green chicken curry tastes more like a Caribbean roti curry..  they give you 4-5 small pieces of chicken and a potato ($15). Overall, service was good but they definitely try to rush you out at the end.	2star
Arrived promptly for dinner reservations Friday 10/6/16 at 5:30. It is a nice place and we were seated downstairs, decor very nice but a bit warm. Our server greeted us promptly. The place was fairly slow. The special of the day was lasagna and my friend had pasta with vegetables. She ordered a bottle of wine since it was her birthday; $48 for the bottle.  My lasagna was okay not worth the $24. I was expecting a rich authentic flavor. It had large pieces of Italian sausage as if they had been into the dish as an after thought. Bread was a bit hard and served with butter too cold to spread. The free olives were a nice touch.  We split a cheesecake whatever their version was; it was so forgettable I don't remember what they called it.  My advice skip this place for the price you can eat at Bucca de Beppo and get better food.

Good chicken and waffles. That's usually my go-to when I'm here. Had the steak once, and it was marinated and too sweet. The fries/sweet potato fries were good. Hope to try the burger next time, looked delicious. Old fashioned was sub-par.	4star
I have no idea how this place has almost 5 stars, it was a horrible experience. I ordered 3 kind of wings, yuca fries, and the sliders to share with my girlfriend. My parents ordered a salad with chicken each. The Buffalo wings were dry and cold as if they had been sitting on the counter for a while before they were brought to the table so the sauce had already dried up in the wings. The yuca fries were stale. The sauce on the sliders was good, but the meat was already getting cold. I took my time eating and sipping on water, watching the football game that was on, and my parents food didn't come. I finished eating all my food and still their salads didn't come. It wasn't until 15 minutes after I had ate my disappointing food that their salads finally came. The waiter never apologized and did not do anything to deserve a good tip. Service was horrible, food was horrible, the overall experience was horrible. I only recommend this place if you want to go drink and watch a game, but other than that stay away. As we were leaving the restaurant, 2 guys walked by saying how they had waited a really long time for a salad and I couldn't help but laugh at how bad this place is.	1star
As someone on a ketogenic/low carb diet, my options for eating are somewhat limited. For breakfast, I target places that have unique ingredients available and so I chose The Smith's truffled mushroom toast this morning. I requested no ciabatta bread and added a side of bacon. I always request my bacon to be extra crispy (because who wants the soft taste of fat?) but this place particularly got the crispness down! The truffled mushrooms and fontina cheese perfectly complemented each other and made for a savory last meal in NYC for me before my flight back to LA.  Also, not sure why, but I made a reservation last night for 9am (for 1 person) this morning and there were no other options available on OpenTable. On walking in to The Smith, I found it half empty? Definitely started filling up by 9:45am though. I've been told that the drinks and dinner here are great so I'll definitely be coming back.  My server was Stacey and she was very attentive, coming to fill up my tea with more hot water even before I could ask!	5star
A bit overpriced for the qualify of food (it's not terrible but nothing special), but the decor/vibe is good and they have big seating areas for large groups.	3star
I got the grain bowl and at least half quinoa was burnt and the texture of chewing pebbles. Meat was good but I couldn't even finish because of how hard it was avoid the burn quinoa. And it's $12 which is already expensive.	2star
Honestly I was shocked mostly by the amount of lobster or lack of it in the lobster roll... But let's not forget how crappy the service was.... So here am I dying for food after a beach day, sitting at a table in this venue. Everything and everyone is just running around like headless chickens (I guess they were understaffed or poorly managed or both). But in this madness one of the servers was leaning on the wall across our booth, texting like a pro and laughing joyfully at his screen in the middle of the dining room floor :) After a substantial wait time, both to actually order with someone and to then await our food, the lobster rolls arrived. Or should I say the rolls arrived since there was almost no lobster in them... They consisted of mostly mayo and lettuce and here and there you could spot a chopped up in tiny pieces lobster claw :). The bun on the other hand was nice and fresh, but I wasn't there for the bread you know.... So after eating my bread bun and some of the stale chips I can just say  DO NOT GET THE LOBSTER ROLL EVER :)	1star
The sandwiches are delicious and the noodles are even better. The place is really nice and a good place to stop by between classes when you are hungry and want a cheap and quick meal. I did however find some hair in my food two meals in a row. They were nice and replaced my meal but i do think it is something they should be aware of. I am not sure if I would come back but I do think it, beyond the hair instances, the food is really good.	3star
Alright so first thing first, this place deserves at least one star for the phenomenal view. Me and my wife went here on a late Thursday night just before Sundown. Sitting by the water was very soothing and relaxing. However, everything went downhill from there. The servers were pretty rude, the bread was average / stale. Their ceviche was pretty good, but nothing spectacular. And then came the main course.  I ordered their scallops (which was the special of the day) my wife ordered some kind of chicken dish. The scallops were gross, seared incorrectly with a poor complement of vegetables. The vegetables tasted like they came from a can. The grilled chicken breast was good, but not as good as the chicken at Costco. To top it all off, one of the servers was pretty darn rude. Didn't refill our water, and gave us a rude look when asked for more bread. Honestly, I spent over a hundred bucks here, whats some bread really going to cost you. Geez. I'm sure if I had a friendlier server, I could have dealt with the subpar food.	1star
My friend and I went here for brunch during restaurant week and weren't totally wowed by the food or service. Wait staff were not very friendly and the food was extremely salty. Everything had an abundance of salt in/on it except the dessert. The banana pudding was mostly whipped cream and very little of the pudding itself. But to top it all off, we both woke up with really bad stomachs the next morning. Whatever it was, we're never eating here again.	2star
(YC2017, 74/100) Some of the best pizza I've ever had!  We were surprised there was literally no wait when we came here one night and were seated upstairs immediately.  You can watch the magic of the pizza making happen on the first floor right in front of everybody.  The staff here is a little brash with that whole stereotypical NY-personality, but they get the job done.   We ended up ordering a large White Pizza with +Chicken and Sun-Dried Tomatoes.  The toppings are added individually and will cost you ~$2-$4.  If I were to make one recommendation, it would be to get the WHITE pizza.  I've had the red as well, and although it was good, the white was amazing!  The pizza only took about 10-15 minutes to come out and it was so good - the slices were large and the crust was thin but had a bit of chewiness to it.  The mozzarella cheese was very prevalent and the toppings we chose went perfect together.  Sharing this pizza among two people, there were about three slices leftover, so I would say one large pizza could feed three people.  We also ordered the Cannoli, and we did not like it at all.  It was way too creamy and the cream was a bit rough in texture. They weren't kidding when they said Grimaldi's had the best pizza in the NY.  For me, they even took the crown for the best pizza anywhere!  Great quality at a fair price - would recommend.	4star
I have been to Traif quite a few times but for dinner. Last Sunday I went for their brunch much thanks to Kat C! She snagged a free brunch voucher for 4 after eating at XiXa. I don't know why it took me so long to review this place. After all I came here to celebrate my birthday last year.  We were seated all the way in the back, not sure if that correlated to our long 2-3 hour long brunch. Our brunch was the chef's selection, we just had to order some drinks. The espresso drink with amaretto had a kick to it but definitely woke me up. After glancing at a few other tables they received almost all the same items more or less. The most notable dish from lunch were the bacon donuts which are a favorite of mine. All the rest brunch dishes were just okay. It was a big difference to dinner-where I wanted more of each dish and is the reason for my repeat visits.   So come here for dinner! Get the bacon donuts and make a reservation!	4star
Sat us down pretty quick, but then no service after that. Never sat with a menu on my lap that long ever. I wish I could have tasted all the awesome food everyone mentioned.	1star
Wooooowwwww!!!! The absolute best seafood place in the East village and may be safe to say In Manhattan! We had the privilege to have dinner here one Saturday night after an hour wait. Thank goodness we waited because I cannot wait to come back!  The soft shell blue crab, and the steamed clam with pasta were absolutely impeccable.! It just melted in my mouth with every bite! The hostess was ok not very enthusiastic but whatever our server was amazing he was attentive and very informative very pleasant to speak with despite him being swamped with work!  I plan to have dinner with friends here again soon. This place is a must! It is on the expensive side but it is worth every dime! If you're just in the neighborhood and want quality food this is the place to go. Try to call ahead to check on the wait!	5star
Favorite restaurant in the Tri-State Area!  I'm a big fan of new American restaurants that mix together ingredients that you wouldn't normally think go together.  From Bacon Doughnuts to Strawberry Ribs - your tastebuds will be enlightened!  Highly recommend the Chefs Menu & as well as almost every other dish on the menu! You really can't go wrong.  Extensive wine selection as well with dessert wines to pair.  Restaurant is busy on weekends - make reservations & make sure to give the exact amount of people (they really do plan for exact seats!) if possible.  Difficult to find parking nearby, if you wait around for a half hour or so you should be able to find a spot.	5star
I came here with a really large group on Friday afternoon, around 5 o'clock, although some people arrived earlier and some people arrived later. I am not too difficult to please, and I am generally a pretty generous reviewer, but I just wasn't really feeling this place. +1 star for the food. Everybody I was with enjoyed what they ordered. I had two shrimp tacos, which were bangin'. There were 4 pretty sizable shrimp in each taco, and the flavor was great, which made them totally worth the $7 each. +1 star for the ample outdoor seating and tents for shade. We showed up with a pretty big crowd, and we were all able to sit without fighting for spots or displacing any of the other many guests that were there. +1 star for the location. It's in a cute & trendy part of Brooklyn, which I don't really care about, but there were a bunch of other bars & restaurants in the area, there were several subway stations within walking distance (including the C train right outside the bar), and we actually got a parking spot just two blocks away, as did several others. -1 star being cash only. I'm not a fan of cash only under any circumstance is, and since this isn't a tiny little venue, I don't really understand why they won't except credit or debit. There's an ATM on site, but I hate paying fees from random, non-bank ATMs. Also, drinks there are kind of overpriced for what they are, they don't seem to run specials, at least not that we were aware of. -1 star for the surprising number of toddlers and children running around. I'm not sure if that's on the venue, on the parents, or both (I'm going with both), but it's definitely as much a bar as it is a restaurant, there were several security guard/bouncers patrolling the place, and I'm just not really about having my outdoor drinking interrupted by kiddos.  I suppose I would come back again, but only under similar circumstances, where it was a group gathering and that was where the group had already decided to go.	3star
It's great. I mean, if you know Up Thai is a gem on the Upper East Side, THEP is better than Up Thai. I could see a line forming up when I was leaving. Yet it just opened for a month or so. It was almost Halloween. There were pumpkins stacking around the bar, and maybe pumpkin lamps hanging all over. Extra points for the effort! I was greeted timely, and luckily found a spot around the bar. I ordered pom and bubble and PLA ABB. POM AND BUBBLE turned out to be a surprise. A Popsicle in Cava with a gigantic flower? Hmm, it took me a while to desolve it into cava. Not bad if fully blended, but would hope I could do less work :) PLA ABB: This is the reason I keep trying new things, to explore the unknown. Tilapia wrapped in banana leaves and grilled to perfection. Not to mention the unique spice they put in. Maybe a secret home recipe? As a single eater, I couldn't order more. But this thai restaurant in UES could be a hot spot in the neighborhood. Mark my words! I'll be coming back soon.	4star
Great chic bespoke lounge. If your idea of great chic bespoke lounge is a place that gives you tuna tartar that has you on the crapper for the next couple of days cursing every fiber of every living thing on this planet... oh and i think when you order beer it should come in a pint...just saying...	1star
Great set up. The wine selection is perfecto. I had lobster ravioli but it was nothing to write home about. My friend had the lasagna which was amazing.	3star
I have mixed feelings about this place. Every now and then, I crave tasty hand-pulled noodles but whenever I finally get to eating it, I always leave a little, sorry to say, underwhelmed. I love the knife-peeled noodles. It is always my go -to because I just love the thickness and chewy texture it gives.   I, for the most part, get #1 house special noodle soup that comes with ox tail, beef tendon, tripe, and a super fried egg. All the individual components are great but the overall taste of the soup leaves me craving for more spice, more seasoning, more something that makes it more memorable. I love to add their chili sauce and cilantro but it still doesn't give me the punch I want. I don't know what it is. It's good, but it just isn't great in my noodle soup book.  As for their pan-fried noodles, I have never really been a fan. Again, a lackluster in taste. The texture and quality of the noodle is there, just everything else is average. Overall, great noodles, average in execution. In a few years, I foresee myself craving it again, imagining it for what it could be, but for now, my stomach will be craving other goodies in Chinatown.	3star
Thanks to Andrew who made my reservation for my birthday! I ordered hot stoned bimbimbap, the portion looks small but shockingly it really made you full! Me and my friends had a great time! Thanks again, Andrew!	4star
There are only a few homemade pasta options. My date got one of the specials (homemade pappardelle with venison, eggplant, and kale). The pappardelle was cooked well but he didn't really love anything else in the dish. I got fettuccine with mushrooms but it was nothing special. Overall, pretty average place I would say.	3star
Gramercy was hands down superb. We made reservations via open table and came during lunch on a weekday. The restaurant was not very packed and was very spacious. We ordered the ruby red shrimp and the beef tartare as the first course and the lamb (rare) and chicken and maitake mushrooms as the second course. Everything was superb! The chicken may have been the most perfectly executed chicken I've had in awhile. It was perfectly prepared, cooked through, but extremely tender. The juicy maitake mushrooms complimented well with the rest of the dish and the wine sauce that was drizzled over the entire dish was superb. We'll definitely be back for the chef tasting! If you are on a budget, I recommend choosing individual dishes from the menu. The lunch seasonal tasting was $98, but doing a two course meal from the menu was about the $60 per person. I love, love the fact that service is included in the price. There is no surprises at the end of the meal when we get the bill. The only thing you would have to account for is tax.	4star
This place is the absolute worst bbq I've ever had. The ribs beyond tough and flavorless, the Iron Brisket Bread beyond salty, the mac n cheese a bore...The best thing about this place was the soda... I do not recommend this place at all...	1star
Every time I come to the city, i make sure to make this one of my many stops but I don't think it will be for any longer because it's become somewhat blah. We came on a Sunday afternoon and I was surprised there wasn't a long wait. I guess the hype of this place really has gone down. When there is a long wait, they pencil you into their iPad and it sends a text when the table is ready. During summer time, they have a few tables outside. This place is quite small as I guess it is really common here but it's really tight. They have one long table in the middle that you sit elbow to elbow next to people you don't know and listen to other people's gossip. The lighting is dim if you come at night so it's hard to see their menu with the table candles. There are markers on each table/bar so you may mark off what you want on the menu and give it to your waiter which she/he will repeat back to you to make sure they got it. No employee is in uniform and they give off that Brooklyn hipster vibe. Bartenders and waiters that I have had here are always nice and helpful.  I am not a meatball lover and this place turned me into one. But lately, I feel like maybe the taste is different because they aren't as special anymore. The Classic Beef meatball just tastes like normal seasoned beef, I would suggest getting the Spicy Pork for some flavor. You can get your meatballs as sliders, sandwich, on top of your side, or on the side of anything else you choose to get. If you get sliders, you can get a different meatball each so you can try their different kinds and sauce flavors.   For dessert, they are known for this ice cream sandwiches between your choice of cookie. I have heard their jello shots are one to try. I wouldn't suggest coming here Fri or Sat night as you will most likely wait and for Sunday, there is no brunch here but its ok, NYC Sunday is brunch everywhere else.	3star
I guess if you like offal you'd love this place. I don't and even though their food is good, portions were very small for the price. Now the guts that used to get thrown away can be monetized!	2star
good food, good place but a bit expensive  very nice design, people are kind still a good place .	4star
A trendy, hip and spacious Japanese restaurant situated in Union Square with a variety of food options to choose from. Besides that, let's not forget that you can actually opt for large orders without extra cost! We came here for dinner on a Saturday night, which we regrettable realized we should have made reservations for. The wait took approximately an hour. We had ordered the uni creme udon, the tsurutontan deluxe as well as my favorite of all the spicy tuna tartare cone. They offered the option of either getting thick or thin udon and we went for the thick, which was good but super filling since we also got the large. The tsurutontan deluxe was a bit lacking in flavor, and essentially tasted like hot pot.  Overall, I would still come back but to try other things on the menu.	3star
Ordered and an hour later with no show. I live less than 3 minutes away...We called twice told it was on the way...called again was then told it didn't leave yet after waiting another 30 minutes ...no show they told us they were backed up. Almost 2 hrs and no food!  Stay away from this place!!!	1star
"went for sunday brunch and was VERY disappointed. the food is good quality but the portion for price is not worth it, not to mention they serve ""brunch"" but dont serve coffee? that was a  it odd. also ordered a french toast and was served a grilled cheese sandwich, when i ask the waitress her answer was ""thats our version of french toast"" :/ (i did not read the explanation under the menu option but if it says french toast i expect french toast..) but anyway. the decor is really nice and the music as well, the place is cool but i wouldnt go back."	2star
I do not have a single critique for Scarpetta - great service, incredible food, gorgeous candle lit ambiance, reasonable prices, substantial wine selection, and - did I mention the food? - Spaghetti: Yes. That's it. It's the spaghetti. It is perfectly al dente. It is perfectly salted. It's perfectly flavored. The basil is fresh. The tomato is sweet. You have to order the spaghetti - Sirloin of Beef: The beef literally dissolves in your mouth. IT DISSOLVES IN YOUR MOUTH ITS SO TENDER - Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli: Very rich - so delicious - but I was glad I ordered it to share with the table - because a full plate would have been too much. Order this and split it.  - Burrata: Yep.  - BONUS: Bread basket - it's FREE and it's not just any type of regular bread. In the bread basket you have warm and fresh stromboli (stuffed with mozzarella, salami, and tomatoes). There's other bread in there that's also delicious that has rosemary and sea salt on it but save your appetite for the MF'in stromboli.  We ordered a delicious red to go with dinner - earthy and bold - a perfect tannic wine to cut through all of the aforementioned dishes. It was a Sangiovese - 2011 Capezzana Carmignano	5star
Two of my girlfriends and I came here on a Tuesday  and while the food was great the service was not! The hostess (I wish I had her name, but can only give a description...she was Australian (I believe), Asian, early 20s with dyed blond hair that she wore in a ponytail) that seated us had a definite attitude that was unwarranted. I don't know if she was mad at someone at the restaurant or if there was something going on in her personal life, but she was blatantly RUDE. After seating us she promptly walked away and another waitress (who was great and super-friendly) came and took our drink orders. After another 5mins the rude hostess/waitress came and practically slammed some waters down on the table for us and then with the most sour face asked to take our drink orders. At this point one of my friends wanted to say something to her or the manager but we calmed her down enough and said we would wait until after we get our food orders. We placed our order and then the waitress that took our initial drink order came back with our drinks and we proceeded to ask her additional questions about the menu. We never saw the rude hostess/waitress girl again as we believe her shift ended and we saw her walking off in regular street clothes. The remainder of the time was great! The other waitress serviced our table and laughed and joked with us during our time dining. Needless to say after waiting for a long time for our food order and catching up with each other, we forgot to mention to the manager the treatment of the hostess, but I do plan on reaching out to them about this issue.  Now to the food... We had three orders of the avocado toast with poached egg, one order of the beet burger, one order of roasted mushroom, and one order of the flattened potato skin fries. The avocado toast is everything good anyone has ever said about it, with the only negative being that it was a bit too salty (we all agreed)...but otherwise it was delicious! My friend loved her beet burger and devoured it! And the potato skin fried potatoes were so good that we were all fighting over them, we only wished the chipotle dip was a little spicier.  I gave this place two stars because the food was good and the one waitress was nice. This place really loses points because although the food is good, it's not great or the best it could be. The food could use a little more flavor. With the competition with tons of brunch places in the city, this one only stands out bc they serve mostly brunch all day everyday (who doesn't love brunch) otherwise this place is just okay.  Lastly, they really should try to teach their staff to keep their personal issues and troubles at bay and not to take it out on the patrons. Not sure if that hostess was new or what, but the rude treatment was unwarranted.	2star
"I wish I had read the latest reviews on this restaurant; unfortunately, I was scrambling to find a Brooklyn brunch spot that did not have a 2hr wait time... ... well, maybe those places have long wait time for a reason!  I ordered Korean fried chicken, and I must second Thomas C. (6/14/2015) on this.  NEVER ORDER THIS OVERPRICED piece of meat. A piece of fried chicken from Fresh Grocer would look and taste better than this. It was literally TWO pieces of deep fried chicken, and next to it was a sad biscuit loaded with ""gochujang honey butter"" which did NOT go well with the biscuit. I ended up asking if they can just give me a plain biscuit and when they did.. except that this time, they just loaded it with butter..  So... I basically paid $16 for two pieces of fried chicken and over-buttered biscuit. For Brunch. On Saturday. Wow. Thanks. My friend told me her french toast was alright, but it was actually pretty soggy. My other friend ordered a burger, and it looked decent, but it was just a plain burger you can find in any lunch places. I noticed that other customers (by the way, the place was half empty at 1PM Saturday.. we had a bad feeling about this when we walked in, and boy were we right) were eating bibimbap, so I am guessing it tastes alright. But seriously, people, if you want decent Korean food, please just go to K-town, and not force yourself to eat overpriced and sub-par food claiming to be Korean-American fusion. Or something along that line. The only reason I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because they did try hard to give us a nice service."	2star
Looks good but the Kali was not cut or served probably I was very disappointed.very gummy texture wasn't able to swallow or chew anything literally bit into two pieces unfortunately not happy about spending $35.	1star
This place is da bomb diggity. I loved the chill vibe and everything we ordered was mighty delicious. - Scallion pancakes: I usually go for kimchi but this was a good twist on the traditional Korean pancake. Spinach, zucchini, mushrooms make for a good mix. Get your veggies in here. - Drunken mussels: I have sky high standards for clams and these babies hit the mark. They were soooo fresh (think Gigi Hadid's booday, in edible form). The bacon gave it a great smokey flavor. Coming back just for this dish.  - Uni bibimbap: uni and salmon roe over rice. You can't fuck it up. - Shaved ice: looks like a bap, but tastes like shaved ice. Those little fried mochi balls are my new favorite things. Stellar presentation, creative use of ingredients. Ten points for Gryffindor.	4star
Quite a let down! I was expecting a lot from this place since it constantly appears in the top bars in the city list. My cocktails were very average and not noteworthy at all.	2star
This review is solely based on the service of Mighty Quinn's. One of the worse service I have ever encountered. The lady working at the cashier was impatiently tapping her fingers against the counter as we were giving her the money and gave us dirty looks. She never even said thank you. If you don't like giving smiles to customers then you don't belong in the service industry.	1star
this may be about my 10th time here-- I like it. The setting is nice for friends, a date or even if you wanna dine alone. The decor is a unique combination of home and entertaining lounge. The Sangrias made me smile...a lot. And the food is always hot, fresh and reminds me of my own kitchen techniques. Taste like real food, mildly seasoned and not processed.  The staff is friendly, attentive and our bartender surprised my gf w/ bday cake and a shot.  my 11th time will be soon.	5star
"If you're over 40, or a dish-splitter, here are a few things you might want to know before choosing Extra Virgin: 1)  You're nearly certain to be the oldest person in the place. It's like Romper Room with menus in there. 2)  It might be very loud, nearly impossible to talk.   On the Saturday evening we had dinner there, rap and hip-hop music were playing.  Loudly.  Not exactly a Mediterranean vibe, & not relaxing.   Felt as if I were in a night club.   3)  If you're female and you order the hangar steak thinking ""This is a heavier dish - I  can split it with a friend"", better make that a very skinny or not-too-hungry friend...or add a heavy appetizer. The portion was barely adequate for one average guy.   Delicious & tender...but skimpy. All in all, food that was average to slightly above, a nice & competent server, but the loud club-like music and the borderline singles bar feeling made me realize this wasn't my demographic (anymore)."	3star
"My wife and I went to dinner here on Saturday, Sept.16th. We had reservations at 5pm. We attend numerous plays and have gone to some really good restaurants within the theater district. We decided to try this restaurant based on prior reviews. This establishment has a really nice ambiance. My wife ordered the Lasagna special and I had the Veal Sorrentino. The food was very good and prices were reasonable. Unfortunately, the service from our waiter was horrendous. He announced the specials, took our drink order, asked if we needed another round of drinks (no) and we never saw him again until desert time. He was serving several tables within our vicinity and he was attentive to those tables. He never came back and asked how our food was after it was served by the busboy.  When we finished our meals, our waiter finally came back and over my left shoulder, he flung two desert placards onto our table and he yelled out ""have some sweet desert"" as he was walking away! Now, up until this point we were not going to complain, but after that incident we had had enough. We spoke to the owner Victor, who happened to be there and of course he apologized profusely, He offered us complimentary desert, but we said no thank you-we just wanted the check so we could be on our way. We did tell him the busboy was excellent-he cleared our table and filled our water glasses. He deserved the tip, not our waiter.  We had just seen the play ""A Bronx Tale"" which was excellent-but at the end of the day, it was ruined by a disinterested waiter. Ironically, there was a street fair along 8th Avenue from 42nd street to 55th street, and in hindsight we should have just had dinner at one of the many amazing food selections available along the Avenue.  There are many fine restaurants in the area with good food. What distinguishes each one and makes a fine restaurant stand out from the others, is the level of service one receives-or doesn't...."	1star
"My mistake for trying to be a fake hipster. I saw the videos on social media touting the off-menu pad thai pancakes and my imagination went wild with all the other off-menu possibilities, like drunken noodle french toast or pancit waffles... Anyway, I was visibly drooling with anticipation when I walked in at about 3:00 PM on a Saturday. Obviously I asked about the pad thai pancakes, and was told simply ""No. We don't have those anymore"" by a harassed looking server pouring orange juice into mimosa glasses probably for the table of wasted ladies screaming out the Thong Song in the corner. Luckily, there was no wait for two, so we were seated right away in a corner conveniently nestled between the bathroom and two tables who were determined to make Pig and Khao regret offering both bottmless mimosas and an easily accessible toilet.  Beverages - Ordered an horchata iced coffee and a vietnamese coffee. Both were quite standard, and nothing mind blowing. Vietnamese coffee was akin to any you could get at any Asian cafe. The horchata iced coffee had a vaguely sour aftertaste - was this some sort of fusion of lime and coffee that I don't have the right culinary expertise to enjoy? Food - pretty good, although my verdict is that you could get dishes similar in taste and lower in price at other places. The garlic rice was tasty, reminiscent of Taiwanese sticky rice, but missing most of the salt and flavoring. That's not to diss the rice, since it's meant to be eaten with other food. I ordered the pork jowls and Brussels sprouts, which was an interesting combination. Salty, sweet, with a sour aftertaste, it complements the natural bitterness that made me hate nature's goose turds - I mean, Brussels sprouts - for decades. The khao soi was tasty, but also similar to yellow chicken curry dishes offered at Thai restaurants everywhere.  So why the three stars? Basically, the service was abominable, the restaurant was smoky and hot, and worst of all, nobody could hear me complain because the place sounded like a club at midnight. Our waiter took our orders and recommended the rice to go with our meal, only for my pork jowls to arrive first and sit there for fifteen minutes while we waited for the accompanying garlic rice to arrive. I asked the waiter where the rice was, and he said he would get it immediately - then I watched him go to the computer at the entrance, type something in, and then emerge with our rice. Fifteen more minutes go by, at which point we decide that if the Khao Soi didn't arrive in five more minutes, we'd just ask for the check and leave. When we told this to the waiter, he went back to the computer and typed something in, and the khao soi arrived in about four minutes. Basically, it seems our waiter forgot half our order and had to keep going back to modify our tab. To make things worse, since we were seated next to the central cooking place, the smoke and fried chili in the air made it hard to talk and breathe - not that anyone could hear anything over the combined din of wailing drunk mimosa addicts and music. Plus, since we were next to the bathroom, the neverending line of people uncomfortably grabbing their mimosa-filled bladders and doing the I-really-need-to-go shimmy literally five inches from my food made it a rather unpleasant dining experience. Came for the hype, probably not coming back."	3star
Their meatballs are a tourist trap!! Really Great concept, but not even close when it comes to delivering.

Delicious delicious delicious. Did I say delicious? Probably my top 3 pizza spots in Ny. Waited in line for about 25 min which wasn't too bad. My fiancé and I were debating between Julianas and Grimaldis. Glad we stuck it out with Julianas. Best pepperoni I've ever had and the dough was thing but yet crispy and chewy and soft. The meatballs are a skip though. We will just stick to the pizza next time. Can't wait to go back! Delicious and amazing. The lemonade was also yummy.	5star
I have had brunch here a few times. The ambience is very cozy but the food can be a hit or miss depending upon what you order. I like the wine selection, appetizers and pasta. I think their dinner is way better. I always get the pasta and a side of brussel sprouts with bacon. The brussel sprouts are one of my favorite item at Felice. It's cooked perfectly never too burnt and the bacon bits are always tasty.	4star
It's whatever. $6 lychee tastes like the cheap drink it is. They were out of pancakes when we went so we had fried dumplings and tempura... no bueno. It's busy but the crowd is very young and random...	3star
Pretty nice restaurant that's not too overly fancy and pricey.  The tacos are quite good, quality is on par with Chipotle.  Service is good.  Burger is not the best but definitely one of the better ones in this price range.   Will be back when I'm looking for something else other than Chinese food.	4star
What a horrid experience with them! The website clearly states no reservations for parties of less than 6 pax (we had 5 pax). Arrived early at the door, only to be told that we cannot be seated because we didn't have a reservation! When we explained that the information on the website said they don't accept reservations, the server looked confused and dumbfounded. The General Manager was quite rude and unapologetic. Won't be going there even if the food is decent due to the lousy service!	1star
Nice server, small space better for 1-3 people, ordered their popular noodle soup, fell flat on flavor and wasn't a fan of the noodles. Felt like I was eating spaghetti in light tasting broth, no depth in flavor.	2star
I've been going to Lam Zhou for years at its first location (now closed) on East Broadway. I find that their new location on the Bowery echoes the same vibe and business model as the first: dingy, cheap looking and zero frills.  They still don't offer any water for patrons and I get grossed out by the quart containers that they use for chilly oil and dumpling sauce. It's really not that expensive to get glass containers with a little tin cover! Their menus are taped up on the wall and written by hand on a loud orange poster.. seriously weird. My pork chop noodle soup used to be $7 but now it's $8 and they give one less pork chop. The noodles and soup are still the same beloved recipe. Fried dumplings are 6 pieces for $3. Giving this place 4 stars because although I have issues with the decor of the Bowery location, the food is just so damn good. East Broadway would've been 5!	4star
Yes it seems brick oven pizzas are the things but one must know how to cook them as well. sadly with the brick oven pizza places opening in Harlem this one doesn't meet the expectations. Is it to much to have a nice thin crispy, I emphasize crispy, pizza. Babbalucci offered a soggy mess of a pizza where it was difficult to identify the ingredients as they all mushed together by time the pizza made it to the table. Also the service seemed off key. I'm not a big fan of one-hit wonders waiters, meaning one waiter takes your order, another different waiter walks around with your food wondering who ordered it and another waiter hands you a bill. Will I be back? Naw but for those who don't realize a pizza is not supposed to be a soggy mess, they'll probably rave about this place.	2star
I've been visiting Nom Wah rice shop for probably over 50 years. It has recently undergone a renovation and revival.  What was a simple dim sum shop has now become a hipster tourist destination. I had a terribly overpriced Cha siu bao. A better quality pork bun is available in any of the Chinatown coffee shops for considerably less money, about one dollar. It is shameful what the new management turned this iconic restaurant into. Jing Fong around the corner is a much more friendly experience. The prices are probably 50% less and the selection far surpasses the one available in Nom Wah.  We had greasy scallion pancake and hard almond cookies also.  I will never return.	1star
We really enjoyed our meal here. I would describe their menu as upscale American comfort food and everything we tried was delicious. To start we tried their new spring asparagus salad. Was super fresh tasting and I loved the shaved goat cheese on top - yum! We split a lovely carafe of wine from California, omg it tasted so good (wish I could remember the name!). For my main I ordered their famous mac n' cheese and bae got the NY Strip with fries plus chimichurri sauce. Both meals were perfect, mine was super cheesy and seasoned just right. Bae loved his steak and fries - the sauce was so good. We wanted to try dessert but were just too stuffed. Definitely would recommend for a nice meal in Manhattan. Tip : make sure you visit their old school photo booth downstairs by their bathrooms before you leave (you know, if you are in to that sort of thing!)	5star
Worst service... I had ordered their Tomahawk steak medium rare, and I was served one well done. They replaced it with a medium rare one, but by that time everyone in the rest of my party was already eating dessert. So I only took one bite of the steak, and had it wrapped to go.	1star
Horrid. Food was terrible and had no flavor. Skip this one. Many other places around with way better food	1star
I came here for my sisters birthday and I had a semi bad experience. First, the place didn't want to take my reservation ( it was only for 7 people) but we begged and they gave it to us. When arriving, most staff were nice except for this one unfriendly staff member (seemed like the one who took the phone call for our reservation). The whole time my party and I felt tense and sort of rushed out.  Now the food. I had the shortrib ragu and it was good. The other dishes were just ok. It was a bit more expensive than the other italian place I go to (and the food is better there).  The menu was pretty small, they only had 4 entree's ( protein dish) basically their options were fish, steak and chicken.  Although it was a new cute little place and was good to try, I wouldn't venture back here.	3star
"Service has gone completely down hill. Fourth time here since they changed their servers and it's been horrible experience. No one is friendly- it takes ten minutes for even a water and utensils when your food arrives. I just got the soggy store purchased ""popcorn"" shrimp and bland raw broccoli. Couldn't even eat one bite.  6/1- So glad I was lucky enough to be on your sandwich board about my dislike of the broccoli I was served four months ago hopefully it changed and the service as well :)"	1star
My other half and I had brunch here this weekend and it was absolutely delicious! We received a sort of cold greeting by the front hostess staff but once we were seated Tori turned the whole experience around! She gave impeccable service from beginning to end. We ordered the popular chicken and red velvet waffle (yes it is as amazing as it sounds), the pecan crusted pork chops, a side of mac n' cheese and corn bread. We also ordered the $15 bottomless mimosas which was a great choice! I can't say enough about the delicious food, quality of service and overall experience (despite the cold greeting...I'll attribute that to how busy they were). We even made sure to tell the owner on our way out how great everything was. We will be back!	5star
Really large restaurant, service was great. Food was just okay.  We were seated downstairs and it was extremely loud.  Could barely hear the waitress.  Menu doesn't really explain what the meals are, just the name of the item, you have to ask your server to explain. With the noise level so high, it was really difficult to hear.  We ordered calamari and hot antipasto.  Calamari was pretty good, hot antipasto was good except for the clams,  which were very gummy and had no taste.  My son wanted order spaghetti and meatballs and my husband and I ordered Tony's chicken.  Both dishes were dry, just okay.  Desserts were nice, tartufo for me was really good.  Brownie sundae for son and chocolate mousse cake for husband- both were great.  Not impressed, don't understand what the fuss is.  Like most Tomes Square restaurants, not worth it.  Carmines up a few blocks is much better.	3star
Probably the worst bar I've ever been to in my life. I can't even describe how bad the food is. And the sticky floors. Argh. When you walk, your sneakers stick to the floor. And the warm beer. My lord, just walk on by. Service was friendly. I'll give them that.	1star
Reservation at 8, didn't get seated until 8:30, didn't see our waiter until 8:50. Ordered bolognese and it was made with tuna?? Disappointment.	2star
I know my opinion is probably not popular but honestly I didn't think sweet chick is that good. Almost every single one of my friends raves about it, except my one other friend who's a fried chicken addict like me. Maybe we have higher standards because we bleed fried chicken oil?  I came here a few weeks back with a friend for dinner. I ordered the fried chicken with the bacon cheddar waffle. The waffle was very bland in my opinion, I couldn't distinctly taste the bacon or the cheddar. The chicken was good, moist, but I felt it was under-seasoned. The skin didn't have that nice crunch I was craving. Service was good, but in all honesty I'd rather go to a place with mediocre service and banging food. That's just my preference.  For the price there's several other 'artisan' fried chicken spots nearby that I think nail it. If you're looking for a cheaper option, Popeyes has never done me wrong.	3star
Ok so I wasn't gonna write this review I thought it was better to contact the business and speak to a manager since I was in the business and I know how it is, however when asked to speak to one j was put on hold, left hanging then hang up on me. FUCKING GREAT. Shows a lot about this place.  Great atmosphere, appetizers really delicious (try the Kale salad so good). My dinner was sent back because it was very salty. The food in general delicious.  We had Lucas and Taylor as waiters and they were very attentive and kind.  Last but not least the HOSTESS. What can I say, I understand it's NY but she was the most annoying, rude, mean...... Felt like we had to beg her seriously  Our table was next to an open window all of our party was freezing even though we were wearing our jackets so we asked her nicely if it was possible to close it. Her answer NO and left we ask again No so a table of 4 next to us left and we asked if we could move. Answer that's a 4 seater we can't sit you there. Ok can we move one of our table next to it so it's possible for the 5 of us to sit. Answer NO whatever we asked her answer was no. Like seriously you kidding right me. I told her I'm freezing I'm not gonna enjoy the experience. After literally begging, she said if you want to be squeeze you can move.  We live in Boston we all have/ had restaurantsssss bigger than this one we know how it goes but if a customer is nice with you and ask you nicely for something you don't have to be a C**** about it.  I apologize for the world but I do hope that if the business owner is reading this to understand that they can't have a hostess and a manager that care less about their place be working for them.	1star
One of my friends recommended this place a while ago, and I finally got the chance to feast upon the cheese wheel with my eyes. Came with a party of 5 around 6:30pm on a weekday, we didn't make a reservation but were able to be seated regardless. The place got pretty packed after we were seated, so calling ahead would be a good idea. We split the Tortino Di Granchio as an appetizer, which was an interesting mix of textures. We were about 3 bites away from finishing the dish when they brought out our entrees, and they just took the whole appetizer plate away without asking if we were done: That was a $14 dish with about $5 left of food on there!!! Beware of speedy servers! For our entrees, we wanted to mix it up with a few pastas. Somehow we ended up ordering 2 dishes of Spaghetti Con Prosciutto E Parmigiano and 2 dishes of Linguine Alla Pescatore instead. They rolled out the wheel of cheese and tossed hot spaghetti in there for mixing: the noodles felt a little undercooked and the spaghetti was cheesy. But, it just wasn't as magical as I expected. The seafood linguine came with a decent amount of seafood and it was average in taste. We opted to get dessert elsewhere. The cheese wheel mix-a-roni was cool to see but it wasn't worth the price of admission, it's probably better to order a different pasta dish and just watch the mixing when another sucker orders the spaghetti. I guess I'm more of a 'chicky chicky parm parm' kind of guy, because the fancier pasta just didn't do it for me. Also, the lighting is poor for taking sweet Instagram photos with your phone.	3star

"I've been coming here for decades.  There is a photo of me in the collage from 20something years ago.  I loved it here. What happened?  No, seriously, what happened?!? My baked clams were ""delayed"", because ""the delivery truck just arrived"".  Five minutes later, hot baked clams were in front of me. Oh, I guess actually cooking the food you serve is so 20 years ago...  clearly, precooked, frozen, and tossed in the oven. We ordered coffee after dinner.  My companion's coffee cup was cracked in SEVEN PLACES and coffee was leaking everywhere.  How those cracks were missed still boggles my mind.  We tried in vain for ten minutes to get our server's attention.  We finally were approached by another server, who asked ours, and a new mug was brought out. Thank you.  Over twenty years of great memories, and I'll never step foot in here again."	1star
Amazing!!! Modern Italian restaurant with great customer service, fancy ambiance and delicious food. We had the scallops and short ribs for appetizer both dishes were outstanding. Scallops were cooked to perfection and short ribs were so tender and juicy you could cut without a knife. My main dish was a stuffed ravioli with spinach and ricotta cheese topped with fresh truffles. This dish was by far the most richest, succulent and flavorful dish I've had in a while. Definitely coming back when I visit NY.	5star
My review disappeared, along with the pictures I posted for this Sik Gaek location. First visit... JANUARY 2015 It was early in the evening on a cold winter weeknight. We looked for parking for roughly 10 minutes before landing a spot a couple blocks away. When we entered, the booth seats were all taken, and the only table left was near the door. My hands were frozen so I decided to wait for an inner booth. We were seated about 15 mins thereafter.  We ordered the jookoomi bokeumbab (small octopus mixed with rice) and the seafood pancakes. They were both quite salty without much flavor otherwise. It's like a boonshik place with more of an upbeat, drinking atmosphere. We ordered about 2 bottles of soju and some Coors Light. We barely finished our food and asked them to pack the remainder. There was nothing memorable about this place, other than that it's crappier than the Flushing and Fort Lee (NJ) locations, the latter of which closed down years ago. It just gave me a dirty vibe - the bathroom was filthy.	3star
My bestie suggested to stop by for a late night snack on our way home. She recommended their tortilla soup as the best she has had in the city. I decided to follow her suggestion and gave it a try.  Broth to filling ratio was 4:1. Barely noticeable pieces of chicken, soggy tortilla strips, and tiny bits of diced avocado and veggies. Way oversalted, oily, and the portion? straight up impossible to worth $6 at all.  Perhaps an off night? Or I need to get my bestie's taste bud checked.	2star
Well there was a band-aid in our soup. If they're going to deny, I'll put a picture up.  It was funny because until we found the bandaid in our soup, they were standing around in a corner not taking orders and just being childish and unprofessional on their phones. When we let them know, the guy who was wearing this funny ass hat (I think is the manager) had nothing to say when we let him know about the bandaid. He said 'oh......sorry.'  ?! How and why do you work at a restaurant when you barely know how to talk to people? Your incompetence was shocking but also sad because it didn't come off rude, it just came of like you were too insecure yet proud to really apologize. We felt so awkward about your reaction, we didn't even say anything else, we just left. You think you can just run a restaurant with the most mediocre menu and pretend like you're in the top already by acting sassy when you can't even manage a CLEAN KITCHEN?? Why, because you have some yelp reviews you think you made it? Compare to the other Japanese izakaya places near you, with your food/menu/decor/service/creativity/portions/price....the last thing you should be doing is dropping a soiled bloodied bandaid in someone's soup. Listen. You don't even have the basics down. You let your kitchen staff not wear gloves and let them drop a USED BANDAID in someone's food. Go get your shit together before you get into your fucking costumes and text each other at work.	1star
The food itself (read the 2-3 star ratings below) are all true. It's not that great for NY standards. If you want Indonesian food, it's better to just go to Astoria.  I was thoroughly annoyed with our server, quality of food and price of Selamat Pagi.  We made reservations for 6-830 (they requested us to be done at 830)-- yet the food did not hit our table until 745PM (starving in the meantime) and we were forced to stay well beyond 830PM. Considering we practically bought out the whole restaurant ahead of time (20ppl), you'd hope that they would be better organized. AND they prepared the menu for family style, it wasn't as if all 20 of us ordered different dishes. Why does it take a 1 hour 45 minutes to bring out--- deviled eggs. Or--cold green bean salad? Or ---even soup! These are items that can be made in advanced.... The portion size for family style is also sparse. Want seconds cus you've been sitting there for now 2.5 hours and you really want dinner (not bc the food is mind blowing)? Too bad.  We ended up having to order bottles of wine and cava in the interim to kill time and when we asked if we could get comped for a bottle (since we hadnt been fed in 1 hour 45 minutes) the waiter laughed. Seriously? You couldn't count the proper amount of silverware to give to us. Worst waiter ever.  At the end the check was $60 a person. This is not high end dinner people. $60 dollars?!? While majority was probably alcohol-- even that wasn't worth it. Come, expecting the worse.	1star
Been here twice and will come again.  Similan curry - 5.  Sooo good. The Roti is amazing with the curry.  Egg rolls - good, fresh, kinda standard.  Beef salad - friend loved it, this isn't my kinda thing. I thought it was alright.  I remember their dessert as being amazing.  Thai tea is strong.  The curry is a star.  We'll be back for the pineapple cod.	5star
so good, portions are quite sizable and way more than what I'd expect from something in soho. super lowkey and casual vibe, don't let the plastic plates detract from the food the morcilla blood sausage and tomato tapa was my favorite, one of the more unique things I've put in my mouth and I'd be happy eating some all day every day  wasn't a big fan of the whipped potato underneath the octopus in the pulpo a la gallega, I'd prefer if it was separate from the octopus instead  my gf and I also split the chorizo and chestnuts tapa and the serrano tortilla (which is more a frittata than a tortilla)	4star
"I've heard countless of raving reviews about this restaurant.  I went with a group of friends and we were stoked to try some of this well known ""chicken and waffle"" combo.  I also heard that their strawberry butter was delicious, but I passed on that.   One thing I appreciated about the waiter was when they asked if we wanted white or dark meat when we ordered our combo.  Alas, the meal arrived and it was...ok.  Not a grand-slam-out-the-park experience; just fine. I honestly have tasted better waffles at other venues before (Above restaurant in South Orange, NJ, heck even IHOP the franchise, Toast in Montclair, NJ). The chicken? I mean, it was fried and there was no mistaking that.  It definitely was just made so it was hot and fresh, but having simply a crunchy skinned chicken just doesn't appeal to me to have me screaming from the mountaintop about this food combo.  I believe they have other items on the menu, so if I happen to be in the area next time, I'll give Melba's a try again.  As a matter of fact, we were with a vegan and he ordered homefries with some vegetables and THAT looked delicious, he also loved it and asked the waiter to give a special thanks to the chef/cook who whipped up this special dish from him.  I may actually ask for that if I go next time, but what I know for sure is that I'm not going to order the waffle again.  (shrugs).   Oh as far as decor, venue, and service? Pretty decent."	3star
I've been here for lunch and the avocado salad is great. Went for brunch, felt for some pancakes. If I could give them -5 I would. They tasted like flour, like actual flour, like water and flour on the skillet. As I write this it's bringing back the awful taste that sat on my chest for the afternoon. Like I said I've been for lunch and the salad was very good and the other food looked good. But do yourself a favor and stay away from the pancakes!!!	1star
A local spot to grab some decent bar grub and a cold beer.  There's an outside garden that's pretty Zen like and has ample seating.  The over all vibe of the place is really laid back.   The wife and I grabbed a quick beer and bite to eat.   I definitely recommend the clam roll and buffalo clams appetizer.  And of course who doesn't love french fries!  They have other non-clam items, but the clams were whole belly and fried to perfection.  But I didn't see any other seafood type items on the menu.   Great local spot, especially when the weather is nice.	3star
Cookshop is definitely a scene but it has a reliable and great menu to boot.  I had the pancakes and cheddar chicken sausage. The pancakes were crispy on the outside and so soft on the inside. The chicken sausage wasn't anything special, a bit bland actually.  My friend had the BEC on a brioche bun which was delicious.  Service was good but not too present either. Apparently you can make a reservation to avoid the 1 hour+ wait on weekends. Good to know for next time!	4star
They have a bunch of options to choose from, but I went for knife-cut pan fried chicken noodles. knife-cut looks like what it sounds like: noodles roughly chopped up with a knife. I like how those noodles have a thin side and a chunky middle sometimes. It's ~almost~ the consistency of pad see ew from a Thai restaurant, if you've ever had that. It came with a LOAD of veggies, which I'm not mad at; most of the veggies was bok choy. They chicken tasted like chicken you'd get when you order chicken & broccoli from a ~good~ Chinese food place. And the portion was great: it can feed two people, or one reeeally hungry person. On the table, they have jasmine green tea free of charge. Drink as much as you want, there's a whole kettle. They also have hot oil, siracha, soy, and vinegar. Oh, and a tub of chopped up cilantro if you wanna sprinkle some on your dish. I liked this place, I plan on coming back to try other stuff.  ..so, why take off one star? because the bf ordered a soup that didn't have much flavor like he expected. :(  BUT! maybe it was just that one plate... Their dumplings, however, are pretty bomb. They're tasty and all of it is freshly made just for you. :') When you ask for them fried, they're not completely fried like some places do them. The bottom is fried. That's fine with me, it's not the first place to do that to my dumplings. To wrap it all up: I'll be back for more noodles and dumplings~ OH, AND THEY'RE CASH ONLY!*	4star
I appreciate the heathy thought behind this restaurant. But the 2 past times I have eaten here, the vegetables have tasted like propane! It is usually on the brussel sprouts and bok choy. I also ordered the turkey burger for the 1st time, and it was SO DRY! Let me give a tip: add grated yellow onion, and it will make for a moist burger!!! With food like this that I can easily cook at home, Westville should step up their game.	2star
With a busy, warm ambience and the delicious aroma of ramen and good food, just being in the restaurant makes you hungry. Service is pretty good as well. The menu is straightforward, and we chose to get the lunch set. The Zuke Don is delicious and well spiced, though a little saltier than I would have preferred. The wasabi? adds a nice touch as well. Personally, I find it good but a little underwhelming. The Kakuni Bao is flavorful, fatty, and delicious. Nothing too special but absolutely wonderful to eat, as the fat melts in your mouth. The Tonkotsu Ramen is, to be blunt, delicious. The broth is quite good, and the noodles go well with the broth. You can choose from a number of free toppings at the table, and the standard toppings are also good - I got the crushed garlic, freshly crushed at the table. Overall, excellent restaurant with excellent food. Compared to others, it doesn't particularly stand out, but on its own it is a very good choice.	5star
"Extremely disappointed in this place.  I've eaten at many Michelin starred restaurants, and this one is NOT deserving of its Michelin star.  Misses the mark on almost every aspect.   Made a reservation on OpenTable, and the restaurant kept calling and leaving voicemails saying they would cancel my reservation if they hadn't heard back from me.  They even sent a text asking me to call in or they would cancel my reservation.  Seriously?  I'm an OpenTable VIP and have never had a restaurant threaten me by voicemail and text message.  When I got to the restaurant, I checked in, told the host my name, and he didn't even acknowledge it.  He didn't say ""Ok"" or ""Great, let me check you in, it will be a few minutes""  He just walked away without nodding or saying a word.  In fact, my dining partner said ""Maybe the host didn't hear you because it's loud in here and he didn't say anything.  You should check in again.""  Since there is nowhere to wait in the restaurant, we had to stand there in front of some people eating.  I'd hate to have that table near the host booth, eating dinner while people's backsides are facing you.  Finally, we get upstairs to dinner--where the tables are practically on top of each other.  They were trying to maximize the number of people in the restaurant, which I understand, but this took it to the extreme.  Our chairs were actually touching the other diners' chairs.  Ridiculous.  The service was in and out of focus.  When the waiter heard that we didn't want wine, he looked like he was going to fall over--like EVERYONE orders wine, what were we thinking not ordering overpriced wine at this place?  The waiter would sometimes pay attention to us, and sometimes, it seemed like he forgot we were eating there.  A busboy brought over a hard piece of burnt Italian bread.  No butter, oil, or dipping sauce.  Just a piece of bread he put on the plate and walked away.  About 10 minutes later, we asked if he had oil, and he brought a bottle with him, and poured about 1 tablespoon of olive oil onto a dish.  For appetizer, ordered the buffalo mozzarella, which was actually good, 4 stars for that.  The second dish ordered was the black spaghetti with rock shrimp.  For $29, this was WAY overpriced for what you get.  There were about 2.5 small shrimp that were cut into small pieces.  And the shrimp weren't deveined.  Seriously?  You have a Michelin star, and you can't devein the 2.5 shrimp you gave me for nearly thirty dollars.  That's unacceptable.  There were some salami crumbles in the dish that were overcooked, hard, salty and mostly inedible.  I didn't want to send the dish back, so I left most of it.  Next was the wild striped bass.  GROSS, fishy, and completely not fresh.  I took one bite, and couldn't eat any more.  It tasted so bad, I knew I had to send it back.  The waiter was missing for about 15 minutes at this point, so he had no idea I wasn't enjoying my fish.  When he finally came over, he asked if he could bring me something else--but it was already too late at that point, so I refused.  The super loud rap music that was playing was absurd as well.  Overall, the experience wasn't only underwhelming, it left a bad taste in my mouth.  A fishy one at that.  Horrible experience from check-in to check-out.  If I had any say, this place would be stripped of its Michelin star so it doesn't taint the expectation others have when dining at a Michelin starred restaurant."	1star

"As a regular visitor to Beirut I feel that ilili (which means ""tell me"" in Arabic) hits it on the head with their delicious mezzas but fails to meet Lebanese standards with their main courses.   The prices are high for any Lebanese restaurant, but typical for a dine in Manhattan restaurant.  Their Hunnish and eggplant mezzas were delicious!  They cut the eggplants into little pieces, fry them, then infused them with their pomegranate/turmeric and tomato based sauce.  It was delicious!  Their raw and fried Kobe were also on par with other Lebanese restaurants!  However, their popular Brussel Sprouts is not a Lebanese dish. So why the 3 star? Their main course was not up to Lebanese standards, doesn't come with rice or grill onion/vegetables.  I've been to very authentic restaurants in Beirut, including Em Shireef, Laila's, Karam and many others, and all, ensure meats are prepared and covered in pita bread, and served skewer style! ilili's main entrees lack flavor and failed in presentation."	3star
We had a great time sitting at the bar on a Thursday night. Food and drinks were fantastic and Ciara at the bar provided great service and was fun to talk with. Highly recommend this spot.	5star
I guess after 10 visits I should write a review.  Dozens of places similar to Boil in New York but no one can replicate their buttery, garlicky, lemony Boil sauce the same way.  The prices are more than generous. Whether the seafood is fresh or not, who the hell cares. The sauce is to die for.  The perfect meal is: - Catfish sliders - King Crab legs - Shrimp - Clams - Vermicelli so you can smother the sauce all over That's it. That's all you need. Throw in some Brussels sprouts for good measure if you like.  Forget the snow crab legs, crawfish or lobster. Stick to the King Crab. You won't regret it.	5star
"Actual Rating: 4.8 Place: this place is absolutely gorgeous!!! The outside of the restaurant is very unassuming so I got a little worried before I got in. ""Damn it, Elaine. You fucked up,"" I thought when I thought I got the address wrong. But thank God, I didn't. When you walk in, you see a waiting area with large golden Bell lights in the ceiling. It gets even more beautiful when you're at your table. My 3 friends and I sat in one of their booths, and we admired the golden roof over our heads. Everything just screams gold to you. FELT LIKE A DAMN QUEEN HERE.  Food: I ordered the Royal Pad Thai since I've heard so much about it on Yelp. I love the way they presented the dish. Not only beautiful, but also very tasty! My friends got the regular pad Thai and coconut milk soup. The regular pad Thai was also pretty tasty, but the coconut milk soup honestly tasted disgusting to me and to my friend. It was a hint of coconut which had a sour aftertaste. I thought they just gave her spoilt coconut milk or something. I think it's just that her and I just didn't like that type of dish since my other friend seemed to really like it. Service: The service was 98% splendid. I loved how the women at the front were very welcoming. They even offered my only ""at least 21 yr old"" friend a drink from the bar while we were waiting for a table. Not only that, the waitress who served us explained to us on how to survey though the menu since there was just so many options that we found it intimidating. Our drinks were refilled and from time to time, we were asked about how we felt which made me feel very welcomed.  *The only thing that disturbed me was that our waitress seemed to change from welcoming to impatiently rude when we paid our checks. This started showing when we only ordered entrees and worsened when it came to the bill. Like lady, I get that splitting the bill among 3 cards can be annoying, but hey, we tried to help you. We put our initials next to what we ordered so that she would know who ordered what. We don't want to make your job harder. Price: Aha, and here comes a concept that everyone is always interested in. I would have to say the food, in my opinion, ranges from decent to a little over priced. It's most likely due to the ambience. But still you can't get full on your stomach from sights. The food was good, but a couple of friends and I left the place still a bit hungry which was a slight turnoff. Conclusion: I would definitely come back here if I ever want to impress my friends or go on a date. I would recommend that you bring a group of up to 4 people so that you can get their roofed booths. And since, this place is very popular, I would recommend coming here earlier since my friends waited 20 minutes and the place was closing soon. If you can, you should make a reservation."	5star
I had heard about this place from a friend who said their XLB (soup dumplings) were really good. My friends and I were in Carroll Gardens and found ourselves really hungry, luckily I had bookmarked it when she had told me about it! The place is a medium sized restaurant, lots of places to sit. They have pictures on the wall as their menu. I ordered the soup dumplings (4 for $4.95), cold sesame noodles and beef noodle soup. My friend was right the soup dumplings are good. The broth tastes clean and has a tasty flavor. The cold sesame noodles were okay, the noodles were a little too hard & lacking in flavor. The beef noodle soup was surprisingly good especially since I was least excited about that one. The prices are pretty cheap.	4star
Saw a huge cockroach before I could order a drink. The waitress couldn't catch it, but thankfully the bartender caught it. They closed the back door as a result, which was the only ventilation in the back of the restaurant. If you can get past the heat and the bugs, then the food is tasty. But if I am going to pay for $15 pancit, then is it too much to ask for a fan or AC.	1star
My favorite pizza in NYC located in a cozy trattoria type location that serves much more than pizza. Salads and pasta are terrific too. The Rubirosa Supreme is my go-to which features fresh mozz, pepperoni and mini meatballs. Even the sauce is amazing.  Very thin evenly crisp crust cooked surprisingly in a gas fired oven - not wood or coal.	5star
I went there for brunch with some friends I asked for wellington benedict it came out cold and the eggs were way overcooked. It was also cold. The meat was nice and juicy though so I gave 3 stars instead of 2...	3star
The doorman was completely rude to us.   Claimed my husband was intoxicated and couldn't let us in when he was actually sober because due to medical issues he can't drink alcohol.  Very disappointed that this establishment, which we have enjoyed before, would behave this way.	1star
Eh, just an okay experience and not up to par to the Taqueria just a few steps away. It's a small place so expect to wait to snatch one of those bar seats.  The drinks are flowing and the bartender was the busiest staff in the entire place.  I was planning to hit the gym after dinner so didn't order any drinks so our 35 min wait for our food (from the point of order) seemed like eternity. Echilada verdes - quite a hearty dish.  I wasn't as blown away as others who have written about it.  It was cheesy and salty.  I had to load up on the spicy salsa. Stuffed peppers with walnut and peppers - a very interesting dish and enjoyed it a lot.  We didn't feel exactly full when we left.  Ended up getting snacks in the neighboring chinatown.	2star
We drove all the way from Silver Spring Maryland to celebrate my sisters birthday at red rooster Harlem because chef Samuelson he's her favorite but what can I say this visit was very disappointing. After we arrive we were told it was a wait it was OK it was short then we were seated in the main dining room or excitement was palpable we've heard so many pleasant stories about this restaurant. After we were seated we waited about 5 to 10 minutes for server to come over once you arrive you can tell that he wasn't pleased that he had to take care of us but we went ahead and ordered appetizers they wet tasty. Again we waited for the server to return so that we could order our salad and entree choice this times it took him over 20 mins to return. I wasn't sure if he knew we could see him because he kept walking past our table constantly never acknowledging us so finally he arrived we ordered our entrée and we decided that we shouldn't be treated this way so we asked him to send a manager over and at that point we told Manager we actually didn't want him to serve us for the rest of the evening because he basically ruined our visit to the location and it was my sister birthday celebration The manager understood and  took care of us for the rest of the evening but at this point to visit had gone down hill there was no return. Our salads and entrées finally made it to the table the food was tasty but the evening in my eyes it was ruined already so we really didn't enjoy yourself as much as we thought we would they sing happy birthday to my sister we paid the tab and we left. As for the restaurant atmosphere it was very exciting there was live jazz music played being in the basement. The bar area was crowded with patrons enjoying their evening out.	1star
One of my best friends is vegan and his favorite food is Mexican, so he was pretty stoked to hear of Jajaja's existence.  We came by on a Sunday afternoon and were immediately drawn into the bright, festive interior. The walls and ceilings are all wooden panels, the floors are made up of colorful tiles, and beaded curtains hang in different areas of the restaurant. The menu is pretty eclectic. Don't come here for your standard burritos and tacos. The tortillas on their taco menu are all made of unique combos like blueberry & flax seed, tumeric, and tomato & beet. The fillings are just as interesting - jackfruit and chipotle almond butter are a couple of the stranger ingredients.  Outside of tacos, you can get things like nachos, tostadas, ceviche, pupusas (!), and even french toast at brunch.  The cocktail menu is notable, with more funky concoctions like matcha, coconut and tequila, or cilantro, mezcal and coconut.  I went with the pupusas because it's a dish I grew up with that I very rarely see in NYC. As far as pupusas go, they certainly weren't the ones I grew up with, nor was I expecting them to be, but all in all they were tasty. I paired them with the 'Matcha y Coconut' cocktail which ended up being a little too umami for my taste. I wanted it to be a little more coconut-y and less matcha-y. Perhaps matcha just doesn't belong in cocktails... My friend went with the nachos and was fan! Very beautiful presentation of the nachos as well.  All in all it was a pretty good visit, but neither of us were particularly blown away by the food or drink.	3star
"I could have given this place anywhere between 3.5 and 3.75 :) 4/5 for the atmosphere and the cocktails (wine list was extensive but it definitely huge mark-up) 5/5 for the service 3/5 for the food. We had a table of 8 and it was a busy Wednesday evening. Scallop was good, squid ink pasta was better an average, spaghetti was average, the Chianti Stained Pappardelle was good, the duck was fine and the Grilled Lamb Chops ""Scottadita"" could have been better. Forgot what the other dishes we ordered.  Octopus appetizer was good tho. If you're taking a client here for the atmosphere and the drink, it's a great place. If you're taking a foodie date here for an intimate dinner (and not the drinks - the drinks were good), I'd recommend going somewhere else."	4star
Great little restaurant with some of the best scallion pancakes and soup dumplings. The scallion pancakes were super flaky and crisp, while the soup dumplings had delightfully thin skin and were wonderfully juicy. Also ordered the pan fried buns, which were delicious, but I felt there wasn't as much meat in the bun as I had hoped. The ambiance was a bit lacking, but it felt like your average Chinese restaurant. Overall, great restaurant and great prices. I'll definitely be returning!	4star
Korean food  is OK ,not enough  place fo seating down Kind of hot and humid .very tight  place , good for quick bite. Not sure if I come back	3star
I went here last night with a friend, and while the food was good, the service ruined the experience. I checked in with the host at 9:00 on the dot for a 9:00 reservation. By 9:10 we weren't seated. By 9:15 we weren't seated, and the host(s) hadn't acknowledged us. By this time I asked about our table and was told they were waiting for several parties to leave. Around 9:25 the maitre d' approached us and apologized, and told us we could wait at the bar. We weren't seated until 9:30--30 minutes late. I understand that predicting reservations is tricky, but 30 minutes is extreme, and I find it shocking that a place supposedly renowned for service would suggest we buy drinks at the bar for *their* mistake. We should have been offered free drinks, or been comped a course or two on the final check. They did nothing to make it up to us. I realize there are bigger problems in the world than being seated late at a nice restaurant. But if you're like me and don't go to places like this often and want your splurges to count, you might do well to go elsewhere.	2star
Opening dishes (french onion soup and mussels) were good.  Main courses were not.  They use too much salt.	2star
Disclaimer: The restaurant doesn't take credit or debit, they only take CASH !! Setting: ( I went around 7 pm) The place is pretty small so don't expect your typical huge dining place like at times square. It also gets pretty packed so be prepared to wait about 30 minutes or more/ or just call in advance for a reservation. The music the selection is hip & the lights are dim so it will be a little dark.  Food: I ordered the 1lb of shrimp with the garlic butter sauce & Mac and Cheese. LORDDD it was so goooddd !!! It was my first time eating shrimp and I wasn't disappointed. The flavor was delightful and the staff was overall respectful. Would I come back again?! Definitely.	4star
"The two O's in Ootoya stand for Overpriced and Overhyped.  As if it wasn't inconvenient enough with the no reservation after 6pm policy, we weren't allowed to be seated until ALL of the members of our party was present. Perhaps that explains the ridiculous wait time? What's wrong with letting us sit at our table first while the rest of our group comes? Atleast we could've used this time to decide what to order? I ended up sharing Maguro Yamakake and the famous Kaisen Don set. It seemed like a no brainer that for two bucks more you'd get miso soup, pickles and steamed egg custard.  My most utter regret was the Maguro Yamakake, it's probably the worst thing I've ever eaten in Japanese cuisine besides fermented soy beans. It was far from what I had imagined it to be from the description. On the menu it's described as "" Blue Fin Tuna is served with Grated Japanese Grated Yam, Sea Urchin and Fried Bonito Flakes"". From my imagination, I assumed this to be a mixed entree dish with chopped up pieces of yam. What I got was plate of mashed up sticky (probably fermented) uncooked yam dough with sprinkles of Blue Fin Tuna, Sea Urchin and Bonito Flakes. I tried my best to be as adventurous as possible but I couldn't eat more than a few bites.  The Kaisen Don was pretty standard, I actually prefer Box of Dreams from Hatsuhana instead. They have more of a variety of fish with bigger portions. I finished my meal off with Matcha Anmitsu based on a recommendation from the server. It's very similar to the Green Tea Parfait. They both share the same ingredients, just that the parfait has cream and noodle shaped cookies in it. The jellies in the anmitsu tasted like herbal jelly almost. I liked that it wasn't too sweet.  Even though things seemed to improve around dessert time, I still left feeling unsatisfied with my meal. I wasn't completely full and the food didn't excite me. Chances of me coming back? Most likely, 0."	2star
What the heck w the bathrooms!  I was not prepared for that experience. Felt like I was using a porta  potty and then to top it off there's a tv in there showing what's happening in the place, really? Spying on bae while in the potty, I think not.  While in the potty the thought , where the heck am I going to wash my hands. Well it's  in the open, looked like a freakin fountain . Very weird !  The food was ok, boom boom chicken. The warm bread pudding yummmmmm. The ambience is great	2star
Best Ramen I have had since leaving Tokyo! I also get the pork bun appetizers and they are to die for!	5star
I am so happy that Nargis opened a second location. We went on a Friday night and got the achichuk, the cheburek, and the plov.  Protip: save the achichuk to eat on top of the plov. The salad was fresh, the chebureki were crispy and meaty (and came with delicious sauce) and the plov I am still thinking about almost a week later. It's sososososo good. The staff was also delightful and the decor was beautiful. So happy this place is in Park Slope. What a wonderful addition.	5star
Once you can figure out where the front door is and get past that sketchy factor this place will change your life. The pizza are absolutely amazing!!!! Fresh out of the oven right to your table. They have a great variety of beer, as well as outside seating too.	5star
"I am forced to give this adorable corner spot covered in cute string lights, one star, because everything other than the ambiance was just awful. Part of 4, Friday night around 8:30pm looking for outside seating, dinner and drinks. The patio had lots of open seats, which now thinking back I should have taken as a bad sign.  Our waiter was a very sweet and energetic man with great character. His personally was NOT the problem, his service was. OMG WAS THE SERVICE AWFUL! So bad to the point I became embarrassed for picking the restaurant. I'll break it down for you.  Waiter came and asked us for our drink order. We weren't ready and asked for a few minutes more to decide. Comes back like 20 minutes later!!!! Really?! Next, our drinks took OVER 35 MINUTES to land on our table. The place was not even half way packed!!! I don't know where the disconnect was, but wow. And they forgot my drink. Brought 3 drinks to 4 people and the guy says ""oh did you want something?""  NOW IM MAD.  Food: one ordered the duck and waffles, said the duck was fab but the waffle was super soggy after his second bite. Mussels got a great review and the strip steak was also a hit. I ordered the spaghetti. It was spaghetti in pesto with 4 pieces of broccoli. It was an itty bitty tiny portion of spaghetti. I believe the price was 19$? The most ridiculous menu pricing  for an item I've ever seen. Oh wait, it gets better. I asked for some graded cheese of any sort. Because the pesto was bland and the pasta was was over cooked I needed something salty on top to make it easier to eat. I asked THREE different people for graded cheese, all of them said one second I'll see if we have any. And never came back.  Wouldn't split our check in half, so beware if you're going in a group and don't want to pay all on one card. Or split the amount on different cards.   OH! And my boyfriend ordered a second drink, twice and it never came. Surprise, surprise.  Only come here if you are extremely patient with awful service."	1star
Incredibly salty and I'm still confused/annoyed that New Yorkers continue to settle for $15 bowls of sub-par ramen. Why. Why would you do this to yourself? Is it because you haven't had any better? Is it because you're just craving ramen THAT much? Because there are incredibly delicious, mouth-wateing bowls of ramen being sold in Japan (even in Tokyo) for $6. We can't even compromise on a $10 bowl? I was hopeful that this place would stand out against other mediocre ramen in the city, like Totto, Ippudo (lol @ Ivan Ramen), but it measures up to about the same. The small bites are kinda good. The brussel sprouts were good but we're talking like a small handful of leaves for $9 here. The tots were the same. It was just tater tots, coated in some mayo sauce, and sprinkled with bonito flakes. Boom. $9.  I ordered the pork bone broth and my gf ordered the chicken bone one. Another friend had the miso and the last friend skipped ramen and opted for the kale salad and wings. I didn't try the wings or miso ramen but everything else was incredibly average.  Such a waste of money.	2star
Look, this isn't rocket science. You come here for brunch, you order the sticky buns, some bacon, and the chicken and waffles. You enjoy the hell out of them. You eat every last bite. You pay the bill, you tip well because the service is great, and you leave satisfied at a great price. I've been for dinner and brunch, while the dinner is good, nothing compares to the brunch. No reservations for brunch, so get there nice and early and prepare to wait. Worth the wait though.	4star
Very good. Havnt been here in a long time and decided to try the spicy and tingly beef noodles. I remember it never being tingly but today it was. My lips are still tingling and i like it! It feels weird but in a good way. I'm glad i finally experienced the tingle that i never got before.  The taste of the beef was very good, the texture was almost goat like. Very melt in your mouth. My only complaint is that i got like 5 pieces of meat. Probably gonna be hungry again soon since it is not protein heavy so thats why minus a star. I would still come back occasionally once in a while when i crave this certain type of flavor.	4star
It has been a long time since I've given 5 stars to any restaurant so this is with much thought and consideration. It was a great time.  I got 1 lb of crawfish and 1lb of shrimp with the special boil sauce which is a must have. I got it spicy and indeed it was spicy, just enough! Total it cost $32. Which isn't bad considering its seafood and the portion size. Other lobster and crab obviously cost more. I wanted to try some apps but they ranged from $8-12, a little bit out of my price range. The sauce was a mix of spicy, garlic butter, and just pure goodness. Everything was cooked to perfection. They had out bibs and gloves so I didn't smell anything like garlic or seafood, other than my breath which was well worth it. The 2 lbs filled me up! Service was so quick, friendly, and informative. Although I did come by myself so seating is much easier, but I watched as couples and groups got sat within 30 mins of arrival. I highly recommend this place. It's located in Chinatown of all places?! The vibe is cute, dim and modern. Everything was clean, only 2 bathrooms so somewhat cramped in that department but nothing else to complain about. Oh and it's CASH ONLY! Luckily I always carry around cash just for restaurants like these. They also have an atm in the restaurant. Oh and I do have to highlight their waiting system. It's all computerized and you get a text when your table is ready. I'm surprised not more restaurants do this cause it is so efficient and people don't have to crowd around the front waiting to hear their name!	5star
I've been coming here for about 3 years and never got around to a review. How do you rate a place like this??? Believe it or not, the noodles here are delicious! Who would've known right?!?! Either way, the noodle dishes here are a solid choice, and I would recommend anyone to come here if they want to try something a little more authentic in China Town.  Only thing is that this place seems a little sloppy and dirty so no 5 stars to you glen coco, but you do get strong recs for being delicious!	4star
"I honestly don't know why people like this place so much.  It's usually close to packed-tight, there's little bar space, the tables are small and the whole feeling of what this place could and should be gets completely lost in the melee. Whenever I have to go there to meet a friend, I am always reminded of the famous line Yogi Berra said long ago, which seems to sum-up why neither my friends nor I consider going to SM: ""No one goes there... it's always too crowded!"""	2star
If the price were $2, maybe I would come again. Actually, no I still probably wouldn't. Simply does not taste good. Vege ramen literally is just bland instant noodles. Ingredients are definitely cheap and unhealthy. Save your lifespan, do your tastebuds a favor, and grab something else.	1star
I found myself in the neighborhood while visiting a friend, so I popped in Jin Ramen for a quick bite at 3pm on Sunday. No wait for bar seat for 1! This place seemed cute and it was packed for such an off-peak time. I ordered the Kuro Shio (lighter broth with karage). I wish I could like it - I kept wondering if I ordered the wrong thing in the menu the entire time! The broth was good, but they gave me 2 tiny pieces of chicken, the egg was poached instead of soft-boiled, and the noodles remind me of Ciapriani's boxed pasta (aka not good). So I finished my beer and paid as fast as I could.  A few good things: friendly service and great outdoor patio.	2star
I call to place. A order. Today. Oct 27. 2017. At 630 pm the dude who pick up the phone several times hung the phone in my face I never got to place my order I don't understand why the rudeness I never been at this place before or called will never. Will again I hope a manager or the owners view this message and improve his team on handling phone orders or calls into a business or get a new phone line. Thanks. I will share this with other colleagues to make sure they don't go trough this bad experience with this restaurant. Well.i been to the other restaurant on 83 rd street. Warning people they have a bad mice roaches. Water bug sanitation and kitchen not properly handling food when serving right so imagine what your plate was at before it got to your table	1star
This place is nasty. I couldn't eat the food or drink the coffee. You pay $2.50 for a thimble of coffee. It's a joke. Hipsters like it because it's cool. It's sad that this restaurant has such a high rating on Yelp. It was impossible to get service. We got two cups of water for a party of five, had to wait minutes for more water and waited an insane amount of time for even the coffee to come (we had to ask where it was). We were given no napkins or utensils, I had to go ask the absent minded wandering waiter for napkins and utensils. We asked for sunflower seed milk for the coffee (sue me) and it never came. We asked for more bread. It never came. You can only apologize so many times before you are just bad at your job.	1star
Great ambience and best view in Williamsburg in my humble opinion.   Food is decent. Drinks were not so great unfortunately. Service was fantastic. I will be returning because it is a great date place, great for happy hour, and a good place to bring out of town guests.	3star
My friend was visiting from Detroit and I reserved a table for saturday at 8:15p.m. At 7:40p.m we were at the address provided on the website and we could not find the restaurant. I contacted the restaurant a couple of times and there was no answer. We then decided to go to Pointy Bistro nearby. I contacted Belle again at 10:49p.m. I was told that the location is building #4. This was not clarified on the website or was I informed when I called to make the reservations that, the address holds multiple buildings. The young woman we spoke to confirmed that I did call a couple of times but they were serving so she could not pick up. After hearing our struggle finding the location as we are not familiar with the neighborhood, she informed me that I will be charged $75 for each party. I did not even argue because I was really dissapointed. Should we have kept searching for the location? maybe. Should they have answeres my phone calls? maybe. should i be charged $150 in this matter? I am not so certain about that. So my tip: know that the location is building #4.	1star
I have been to the OBAO downtown for lunch. It was pretty good. The team decided to come here for dinner. We had to wait for at least 30 minutes to get a table for 6. I guess it was worth the wait. Too bad it was too dark in the restaurant and I didn't take any pictures. We ordered pork belly, vegetable dumplings, kimchee fries, pad thai, kra pow gai kai dow (minced chicken, holy basil, bird's eye chili, garlic, onion, fried egg served over rice), and clay pot fish. Everything tasted great! I will definitely go back there and take pictures of the dishes next time.	4star
I think it's under new management. The service and quality has drastically declined. The hostess was incredibly unprofessional, disoriented and clearly not trained well. When we arrived no one was at the front on a slow weekday evening, another party was in front of us also waiting. None of the servers or staff noticed the group of us waiting for a while and finally the hostess arrived. She took one table back and then when she returned started to take us back but stopped to answer a phone call. She made faces while listening to the caller, ran to the back again and then to the front picking up the phone again. Wasn't sure if they are only serving phone orders now or customers that are physically present.... We had to ask for more water or bread multiple times. My Coke was totally flat with no carbonation. When our server took our order we got dishes with different noodles than we originally ordered. (This is a place that specializes in homemade pasta) The dishes themselves seem very boring now and the flavor is absent from what it used to be.  Super sad my fav place has changed for the worse.	3star
Excellent, excellent, and excellent.  This tastes like the food my friend's mother used to make.. Run, don't walk, over and get yourself some soup dumplings, the wine chicken, the cha chiemeng (noodles with meat sauce, I probably butchered the spelling).  Tea served with your meal, and actual friendly service with individuals fluent in English.  But who cares?  The food is just delicious.  Love it.	5star
Dissapointed by the overall quality of the food, price, and menu. I'm still trying to figure out what i just ate. The Brisket was bland and lack depth. The sides were made with no complexity of flavors at tasted right out of the can. The available bbq sauce was vinegary and was worst than store brand. The  'specials' are overpriced and limiting. Customer service was little to nonexistent even as i was the only patron in the store. There are much better options on myrtle avenue. For fellow foodies please avoid this spot for now! Not sure why this place received such high marks unless these are company sponsored reviewed.	1star
"I ordered food based on the review here and recommendations from my friends. One quick summary of my experience - not as good as I thought. I heard so many good things about this place, but my impression was that it was a normal meal. The soup was great - goji and other spice, the flavor was unique. But we also ordered vegetables and chicken with rice, which are both mediocre. Plus we waited 20 Minutes to be seated and it's cash only. The people who brought us to the table kept saying ""be quick be quick"". My friend and I were like, wth how many things should we put up with here?"	3star
If I could rate my overall service it prob would be a 3.5! My boyfriend suprised me by coming here before V-Day and I loved the ambiance. The server reco'd 5-6 apps, but I definitely think we could've been fine with 4-5 (definitely not 6). I was ready to pop by the 5 app came out and we could barely finish it! Our favorite tapas were the tuna tartare. We've also order the below: - Strawberry BBQ Pork Ribs: Good. Fell right off the bone, but the sauce tasted better than the actual rib. My mouth was tired of chewing when finished.  - Spicy Shrimp: Not worth it, too sweet & spicy - Butternut Squash Soup: On the house as a sampler, but it was yummy! - Pork Belly: Too Greasy and was a bit too dry.  Drink were delicious. Server was decent- didn't really talk much and wasn't personable. Also, It's located in a random neighborhood in BK, but the decor is super cute for date night!	3star
"Came to have dinner with my friends. The manager was very rude to us. First, he told us if our party is not complete (we have 2 people sitting at the table and ready to order and 2 more people are walking over) we will have to leave the table. Secondly, he throws 2 menus down m and said ""you only got 2 menus"" and walked away. Unbelievable. Me and my friends did not expect this disrespectful service. We left right away."	1star
"Nice people, decent service, but mediocre food. The lamb was over cooked, the rice insulted by a deposit of dull tomato sauce, the salad overweighted with feta, the spinach pie was bland and gloppy, and what they called ""fries"" were actually overcooked disks of potato smothered in inappropriate cheese.

This is my worst dining experience ever !! So we had a table booked at 6:30 we went in and sat down at 6:20 it was my husband and I and we were with our two kids expecting two other people . They  were very rude not very welcoming . They sat us down I asked for some breadsticks to keep the kids quiet the waiter was like give me a second he had white hair and was the rudest waiter I have ever met in my life and I have been to some good restaurants in NYC and in Europe all Michelin stars ! He kept passing by with a smirk on his face . Until our other two friends arrived my husband asked him what wine he has by the glass rudely his response was I gave you the menu seriously ?? Finally our friends arrived and it took us a while to order cause we were catching up and this guy constantly comes and checks to see if we're ready to order every two min but with a sarcastic joke each time . It was making us very uncomfortable !! The waiter complained twice about my kids standing up which I completely understand but I was trying my best to calm both my kids down . If they had a problem with kids dinning in their restaurant they should not allow it not treating their customers low and sarcastically being rude ! Shame on you !! Too many incidents to mention . I am a resident in the west village but this place You are going to be judged from the moment you walk in . And to our waiter and all the other strange men constantly hovering on our table FYI you are the servers not me !! Do not look down on clients !!!	1star
Holyfreakingheck this place is adorable. Went with coworkers for a drink after work, and we all enjoyed the teapots (bourbon was a favorite for all involved) and it was fun seeing everyone get into the tea party spirit. We wandered downstairs and enjoyed the decor, especially the bathtub, and rock walls. I think I can speak for everyone when I say that we're all looking forward to coming back again!	4star
ordered hand pulled noodle in lamb soup, about 10 bucks. 2 star to the bite size cube, fresh and tender, marinated perfectly, home feel cooking. Try it before the sweaty summer arrive. 1 star to the fresh mixed green. 1 star hand pulled noodle, it is average, the noodle was tender, but few are tangled. broth was tasty, but not clear as it should be.	4star
Didn't enjoy the food, nothin close to the food in Thailand. Haven't returned since it first opened	1star

Horrible management, rude customer service  Got my order wrong  Really really rude  May have been racist  And the chicken came PINK  not edible at all felt sick after  Do not go guys	1star
An absolute awesome experience from the moment we walked in. The food was spectacular only to be surpassed by the service at the bar... Noel in particular served up amazing craft cocktails all evening!	5star
The crabmeat xiaolong bao here was fantastic! They came out piping hot, flavorful, soupy, with a thick enough skin to contain the broth but thin enough to not feel carb-overloaded with each bite. We were pleasantly surprised to find such a good xiaolongbao at a restaurant whose staples are Cantonese dishes.  The congee was alright. We got the fish and pork liver congee, and the pork liver is not as good as some of the other congee places in Toronto and Chicago. But we were really wanting congee that day, and it hit the spot.  The wonton noodle soup was really well done here. The filling to the wonton was flavorful with a full shrimp in each one. And the noodles were probably the best wonton noodles I have ever had: really al dente and has a very good bite to it. Definitely order this.	4star
This place is great. It usually has a hefty line, but last night, we were seated quickly. Shanghai Asian Manor is cash or Amex only, so be aware.  We ordered 7 dumplings (yes, a lot!) and of the dumplings, the Sichuan style pork dumplings were the best. The soup dumplings are good but the soup dumplings from Nan Xiang in Flushing are better.  The eggplant with garlic and pork was phenomenal. I'd definitely suggest getting this as an appetizer. We ordered two noodle dishes - jjajang and pork lo mein. The former was better, as the meat and sauce were braised and softer. Very delicious. The shrimp fried rice was good, but nothing special. All of these together were $83, and it fed four people very well.  Overall, this place is a good place to grab food with friends. If you're in the city, this is your best bet for soup dumplings. If you can access all boroughs, go to Nan Xiang as the food there is better.	4star
It was good for the noodle vegetable meat part; however for the limited ingredients, i wasn't all that impressed.  I'm a fan of drinking broth following eating everything out of the bowl.  This broth throughout the whole eating process tasted very watery, lacked depth of flavor, and not too pleasant to drink.  I tried my husband's who had the very spicy version.  Again, his broth also tasted like spicy water and not any meaty or vegetable depth of flavor either. Noodles and pork and bok choy were great though of course, but i'm really in need of a good broth to go with the soup as it's a soup!	2star
I was in New York on business and really craving Japanese food. I came here on the first night hoping to get the same quality of food that I can get at Ootoya in Japan. I arrived here a little after 5:30pm, and there were already many groups here. I sat down at the counter and asked if they had hot green tea. The staff said yes, so I ordered it. I got my drink. I had a sip. It wasn't green tea. Hmmm. i ordered mini kaisendon as I didn't want to eat a lot, but mini kaisendon was very disappointing. I only got about 7 pieces of okay quality sashimi. Miso soup wasn't bad, but chawanmushi was watery.  Hakusai no tsukemono was bland.  I was very disappointed in my food because I really wanted to like this place. I rather just go to Ootoya in Japan or other Japanese restaurants.  The service was okay. Nothing great and can be improved. The prices weren't great, but hey It's New York.  I won't come back here.	1star
This place was good but it definitely wasn't the best I've had. I had much higher expectations for one of NY's most popular ramen joints. My bowl of ramen was good, I added the spicy paste which definitely helped the flavors. It was pretty small and overpriced of course. I enjoyed it but I definitely wanted more. Luckily I stayed near by and didn't have a wait but I wouldn't come back if I had to wait more than half an hour. The pork wasn't anything great either and wasn't as tender as it could have been. Not memorable.	4star
My go-to location for out of town guests! This far no bad experiences reported. Excellent customer service and ambiance. And the food...BOMB!!!	5star
The lamb shawarma tasted better the 1st time I came here, it also had more meat and less veggies.  The chips didn't even taste as fresh.  My friends salmon was decent.  I guess maybe I need to eat at a place a couple times now to confirm the rating ha.  Give it a try but there are definitely better options nearby.	3star
Must try - octopus, Japanese fried chicken and spicy ramen. Cosy find blocks from World Trade Center!!	5star
Worst restaurant ever I've been to...  No A/C , super hot ..  We ordered one glass of white wine and prosecco. Both were WARM.  We ordered appetizers for each person and after we finished the appetizer, we had to wait another 30min or more to receive a main dish.  foods were disappointing .. that was the worst part. Again.. we've been waiting about 3-40 min and .. it was Monday dinner time. ASHAMED	1star
Communicated with one of the managers(Nikki)  about reserving a space for my birthday and also having a paint session in a room off sweet science. I communicated with the manager through text and  she asked that I send her the number of people , date and time. I responded. She replied that she would get back to me the next day whether she was able to get a space or not. This was March 7th. I waited two weeks thinking maybe she was still trying to find out or possibly busy with work. Keep in mind I've been here before so I raved about the place to a few of my friends saying it was great open space and the service was decent, so I wanted to business with them. I decided to text her just to touch base and received no response. The most she could of done was at least be professional about it and let me know whether or not she was able to find a space. It's really unprofessional on her end. I definitely wouldn't recommend anyone reserving a space for brunch.	1star
"I normally don't write reviews on Yelp, but today Just Beclaws really pissed me off. My girlfriend and I were starving at home, and so we ordered through UberEATS. Initially, when the restaurant accepted the order, the estimated arrival was 7.05pm.  We waited and as they prepared the food, the estimated arrival kept delaying. Eventually when I called UberEATS, the estimated arrival was changed to 7.55pm. (Yes, they were still ""preparing"" the order.)  The customer service agent went ahead and investigated, only to find out that they were unavailable to make that order. After an hour and a half, they finally failed trying.  I mean, you don't have to accept our order if you can't. You can tell me about not being able to make my order as soon as you figure out. WHY WAIT an hour and a half?  I'm using the only strength left in my body to finish up this review. I'm starving, and I hope no other starving people have to go through this."	1star
Sorely disappointed with my meal today. This used to be be the best restaurant in New York and had food I would fantasize about when not in the area. They made a few poorly received changes to their menus.  I ordered tuna carpaccio, which used to be delicately flavored and textured and taste absolutely amazing. Now, it's a bit thick and rubbery and they added chorizo the the top of the entree. The competing flavor of the chorizo destroys the light airy flavor the carpaccio should have. I also ordered a monk fish. It too, was rubbery and very salty. The sauce was not particularly appealing. The dish had some Inedible yellow stringy thing in the center of it that I suppose was meant as decoration. There were also a few pieces of potatoes around the entree that looked gray and unappetizing. Very disappointing and for $300, definitely not worth coming back.	2star
Came here on a Saturday night around 7pm with one other friend. We got seated right away which was very nice. The atmosphere is very cozy and homey. It took about 10 minutes for the waitress to approach our table. We got the pan seared oysters, tender baby lamb chops, and shrimp casserole. The pan seared oysters were more deep fried than pan seared. The tender lamb chops were actually quite tough, and the shrimp casserole tasted as if the shrimp and mushrooms were sautéed in tomato sauce. The waitress only came over to our table twice; once to take our order, and once to hand us our check. Overall, even though the atmosphere was nice, I will unfortunately not be returning here.	3star
"They should get a -star on the service, first and last time I'll visit this place. My wife and I went to the mechanic across the street from this place like around 10am on 3/15/2017, the mechanic recommended for us to go get coffee while we waited for my truck to get fixed. We walked across the street and as we walked inside this so called restaurant, this waitress was prepping the tables  and asked us with the only attitude if we were going to seat and eat ? and we told her that we wanted to seat on the tables, then she replied that they weren't ready while the restaurant was empty, she wanted us to seat on these high chairs next to the windows, mind you it was like 3 degrees outside and asked us if we like to seat in the high chairs and my wife said ""well we don't have a choice"" then that good for nothing replied with an attitude ""YES YOU DO"" ..! My wife and I looked at each other with disbelief and my wife couldn't stay quite, turned around and told her off ... then we got up and walked out of this shit hole.  As business owners we couldn't believe how can a businesses like this could stay in business ..? Or how could they hire animals like this ..? It's a shame that who ever is the owner of this place which we hope he's not a ignorant, would read this and finds out who's this animal working for him is, because she doesn't deserved to be called a waitress...!!!!"	1star
We ordered the red curry and it was extremely watery and way too sweet like sugar water. When we told our server he was extremely rude and did nothing about it. We asked for lime and they did not give that either. We were extremely disappointed and will never go back there again.	1star
"Have been to Trattoria Trecolori three times now and each time have come away saying ""I'll go back there again next time I'm in the City""!  The service is wonderful.  Service staff is very attentive, professional and friendly.  We had reservations for a show and told them that when we made our dinner reservations.  They made special effort to serve us without us being rushed and still get us to our destination on time.  This was so appreciated. The food has always been top notch:  fresh, nice portions, and just delicious!  My party has always asked for recommendations on food and wine and have always been exceptionally pleased with the choices.   The restaurant itself makes me feel like I'm in Italy n a neighborhood, family place.  It's classy but not stuffy....just very welcoming and warm. Would recommend this to anyone, and they offer gluten-free dishes which was necessary for a friend of mine. Can't go wrong with this restaurant!"	5star

"Dropped by Coppelia in the afternoon in order to get a sandwich.. I was expecting more of a casual place, but this eatery can actually more accurately described as a cuban style diner. When me and my friend popped in, I think we were the only ones who ordered food to go.  I got the cubano sandwich, which was what I had decided on getting after taking a quick look in the menu. It has cheese, for any of you interested. They finished the sandwich in about 10 minutes, and the total came to about $10 something after tax. I felt like the sandwich was decent, but not any better than cafe habanas. Furthermore, the diner didn't seem that appealing to me. It was fairly full when I visited, but it was almost a bit too crowded in a way. The place is very dimly lit, and while I generally like more dim environments, this darkly lit restaurant gave me more of a... ""this is a very small space"" kind of feeling. Perhaps changes to the lighting can help. The bathroom situation here is also unimpressive. Only one toilet (shared between the genders I suppose), which makes for a big inconvenience in terms of wait time. However, it seems like this place is known more so for it's late hours, so I may come back some time if in the area at 1:00 AM or something."	3star
The food is average but the service is absolutely horrendous. I hoped this would be a new thai gem near my office but I was so disappointed. Half of our party arrived on time for the reservation, but they wouldn't seat everyone until all showed up (not uncommon in new york). However, once we were all gathered at the restaurant, we were told it would only be a few minutes, yet we waited and waited to be seated - after asking the hostess a couple of times why we were waiting so long and she almost yelled at my friend telling her that since the rest of our party arrived ONE MINUTE later than the 15 min reservation grace period we would need to sit down and wait. The tone was honestly what bothered us most. Had she stated the restaurant policy in a thoughtful manner, it wouldn't have come across so rudely. This left a sour taste in our mouths for the remainder of the meal. Throughout the meal we attempted to get the server's attention multiple times to no avail, at one point she even made eye contact with me and looked away quickly, ignoring our table. The service here exhibits no quality or consideration for the customer's needs. In terms of food, we ordered the basil fried rice, the pad see ew, the spare ribs on sugar cane and the cashew chili chicken. Food was average, pad see ew was way too sweet with the mango relish on top. The only thing that I'd say was well prepared was the chicken and basil rice. Food gets an average rating, especially because it's still a bit pricey, but I would not return solely on the service.	3star
"My three homegirls and I waited what felt like forever for our food to come out.  The ""rice"" that accompanied my skirt steak and maduros was concón. For those who don't know, concón is the crust of rice formed at the bottom of the pot. They must have been low on rice and scraped the pot for whatever bit they could put on my plate. It was hard, crunchy, and not what I expected.  When the waiter came to retire our plates, he asked my friend to pass him her plate. So, this is self service? I'm all for helping the waiters/waitresses out and leaving the least mess possible at the table. But to ask that a plate be passed to you? And not a ""May you please pass your plate, ma'am?"" either. No. The steak and maduros were good, I'll give them that. The service however? Yea, I won't be returning."	2star
Came back to Antonio's Trattoria for a special occasion w/ the family and everyone at the table was blown away by their food. The Pork Chop Scarparo, Gnocchi alla Boscaiola, and Short Ribs Toscana are all must haves.	5star
I'm convinced all of y'all giving this place good to great reviews have never had good BBQ-and for that I'm truly sorry. This was the second worst meal I've had so far in my life.   It started out with so much promise. The appetizers were great. Fried pickles & jalapeños, the wings, and iron skillet corn. Delicious.  Then we move on to the mains. First, either our order was put in very late or someone else got our food. My homegirl ordered mac & cheese as a side. She got the mac & cheese 25 minutes before her actual entree. The waitress sees this, but never stops. Finally, when we do stop her, she says yeah I thought something was weird. Um....so why didn't do something? Ok so food comes out 10 minutes later. Looks good. Until you taste it. No flavor. Pulled pork is dry. Brisket has no flavor. And the ribs are NOT fall off the bone. And it wasn't even hot! I sent it back. If it were adequately priced...I'd have chucked it up to a learning experience & called it a day...nope! That meal was $32 with no sides. Uh uh...wrong one baby.  The one positive was Connor. He did his best to make it right! But besides him, service was horrible, the food averaged out to Blah. And it's way overpriced...save your $ people!	1star
Very limp salad that came with the panini. The panini itself was not bad but certainly not great. The cafe is only good if you can't wait to get back to manhattan	2star
We visited Bengal Tiger for dinner with high hopes and everyone in our party returned with a negative review. The restaurant is small with about 10-12 tables only. If you have kids, you'd be lucky to get a high chair because they only have 1 high chair and it might be already in use (as was the case when we visited). We ordered from the prix fix menu. The samosa were hot and the chutney was great. The Mulligatawny roll was pretty good too. The entrees were bland all around the table (chicken, and veg) and the spice level was horribly low, one wonders if it is an Indian restaurant! The service was slow and not what had we expected	2star
Vegetarian Indians BEWARE: This place is way too hyped up. The vegetarian tacos are tasteless and bland. The beans are inedible because they contain lard, and the service is overall awful. The cooks seemed annoyed when I would ask about different options with my tacos as if I do not have a right, but I can  deal with poor service if the food is good, but to my dismay, it was not. I am a lover of Hispanic food and culture. Los Tacos does not hit the mark. Do not waste your time waiting in line for this place. As an Indian, I know good food, and this definitely was not it. Simple bland and boring.	1star
Wayyyy better than an episode of Netflix Chef's Table.  The kitchen is a well oiled machine, great experience sitting at the chefs counter. My wife and I live in the area and come every few weeks - it's that good. Try the cauliflower side, the duck, spaghetti / egg / mushroom. And even though it's upscale they have a burger that's out of this world. Great atmosphere - open space, 2 floors, huge vertical garden.  Last time we got dessert on the house, homemade mini doughnuts - really nice staff all around.	5star
Stopped in for a quick lunch had the vodka pizza which was excellent service was fast and friendly will defiantly return	5star
Let me start by saying that the food was good. BUT at the end a Roach, im not kidding, a big roach ran from the wall, unto the table and then under it. I wish to God that we killed it so i can have proof.. I have never been so disgusted. I wont ever go back for this reason. Food: Salted,pepper squid was very good. Just the right amount of Salt, and pepper. Ordered the string beans with meat, no meat, they were very scarce on the meat, but tasty.  Scallion pancake,  no flavor and way to greasy.  Dumplings: The crab and pork was the best, soup was super tasty and full of flavor. Service: It was okay, fast, and just in and out. They  weren't  to attentive, but anyone walking  by was willing  to help.	2star
The two stars are for the food and the nice guy in the kitchen.  Bar service here is some of the worst I've seen.  If rude and hipsterific is the vibe you're going for, then this is your place. I'm not one to give bad reviews but having gone out of the way to visit this place for a friend's party, and having an open tab at the bar, one would think the bartender wouldn't have to act like she's doing us a favor to get us a drink. I'm all for supporting small local business but can only hope the owner is reading some of these reviews.	2star
Another great experience here. The line in front was long but we were seated after about 15 minutes since we were willing to take an outside table. Half white pizza, half margarita with mushrooms, sausage and pepperoni. Delicious. Love this place.	4star
I've heard a lot of good things about brunch here so I thought I would give it another shot. My friend had a reservation for 1pm. Unfortunately, I couldn't make it on time for my reservation so I just told my friend to snag 2 seats at the bar for us. If it was a larger party there definitely would have been a wait for a table or seats at the bar.  We ordered some chips to share that were topped with blue cheese fondue. I ordered the Sicilian baked eggs with spicy tomato sauce, artichokes, burrata, spinach, and ciabatta. The chips were alright but after a while the chips became soggy with the toppings. When it was fresh it was pretty tasty but such a large portion it would be better if we were in a larger group. The eggs were surprisingly really good! I ended up eating all of it. The ciabatta bread however was pretty hard and I ended up not eating it. My friend ordered an eggs Benedict and she really liked it. The thing that was lacking was the service. I had no idea which bartender was waiting for me. My friend ended up telling me he left half way through our meal and didn't say anything. It was hard ordering any beverages because I wasn't sure who took our drink. I would have had more cocktails if someone actually came around to us.  The saving grace however was the Photo Booth at the end. I love a good photoshoot!	3star
I have been here before and after they changed their menu. They used to have just that - burgers and lobsters for $20 each, now they have an expanded menu which makes it even better! It stinks that the prices aren't necessarily the same, but the food is still spot on. I stick to the lobster roll and the burger every time and always convince someone to share them with me so I can have both! They also take reservations so definitely make one if you are going during an obviously crowded time. Bar is also a nice spot to have food and drinks as well.	4star
I've been here for dinner and brunch.  Not many vegetarian options for dinner -- butter sauce pappardelle pasta was pretty good.  Portion was ginormous beyond belief -- at least 3 meals.   They have a decent brunch set which includes a mimosa or other breakfast drink.  Monte Cristo is super cheesy and unhealthly deliciousness.  Mushroom omelet and spinach benedict were both decent -- nothing spectacular, but both are standard fare breakfast items.  Don't get your hopes up on the pomme frites here because they are mediocre.  Sad when a French bistro doesn't get the pomme frites right.   Brunch starts at noon and not a minute sooner.  But this place fills up fast, so worth coming a few minutes early and squatting across the street at the juice bar. Really cute, tiny bistro ambiance.  Tables are really close together, so don't plan on getting up or having a super private conversation.  It still feels intimate though in it's own way -- must be that European thing.  Service is really laid back and nothing is rushed, even if they have a line -- this can be a good or bad thing I suppose.  Chill.	3star
We visit this place at least once a month. Location is perfect, atmosphere is nice and food is tasty.  They also have interesting drinks. I highly recommend this place if you are in LIC	5star
The chicken and waffle IS THAT GOOD and I'm not even a chicken and waffle fan because I'm always let down. I had their salmon Alfredo with spinach a few weeks ago and that was good as well.	5star
Was just ok. It was bit salty... and the corns looked like a can corn... anyways.... it was just ok	2star
Everything we ordered was super-dry.   Seafood Satay appetizer was basically disgusting.   Beef Rendang tasted like it had been sitting in the sun all afternoon.   Fish curry.  Don't think my 11-year old son would dry the fish out like that.   Big time disappointment.   Staff nice.  Beer good.  Atmosphere good.  Food sucked.	2star
"My first impression was disappointing. The bartender was incredibly drunk, and incredibly rude. Not too crowded---I stood at the bar for a good six minutes before either of the bartenders ""noticed me"", then another six before the bartender approached me a second time and asked what I wanted to drink. I get it, you work in a bar, and you get to drink, but please don't be more belligerent than the customers just because ""you work too much"". We all do, don't drown your sorrows while at work, and then call us all ""motherfuckers"". Not. Cool. This guy needs a different job--- not around people."	2star
Came here with a friend to have dinner a few nights ago, she'd heard about this place through a friend of hers and was dying to try it.  We had about a 45 minute wait to get in (which they informed us of) and were seated on time.  The pasta here is very good.  I got the prosciutto and penne (I think it was penne)....it was very, very good.  Only thing I'd have to say was that portion was smaller than you'd hope for a $20 plate of pasta.  My friend got the pasta that they make inside the giant wheel of aged parmesan, which was also delicious. Wait staff was friendly and attentive and the atmosphere was nice, if a little loud due to the smaller size of the place.  Overall it was very good.	4star
This is an establishment that apparently deems itself too successful to care about their customers. I had appetizers while there which were fine (although serving portions are tiny). Rather, there was water dripping from the ceiling at our table and when I informed my waiter, nothing was done about it.	1star
This spot gets absolutely CRAZY BUSY -- at times, they'll completely stop phone-in orders for takeout/delivery.  Then, you MUST call back later or visit the store and place your order to takeout or dine-in.  Alright, I've eaten here twice. Once in 2015 and the other in 2016.  2015: Experience(takeout) was amazing, I ate chicken and waffles. The chicken(breast) was tender and moist on the inside, very crispy on the outside(as it should be) and the waffles were great.  2016:  Dine-in.  Service was great, they kept the corn bread(free) flowing... and I liked that idea instead of regular ol' bread.  I believe it was a Sunday evening, and we were seated immediately.  I then ordered, fried chicken(breast) + mac +  mashed sweet potatoes.  Unfortunately the chicken breast was FULLY DRY, inside and out :-( However, sweet potatoes(star of show) made up for that, as the Mac n cheese was slacking as well .. it didn't seem fresh, it was made and sitting waiting because it wasn't hot it was like warm(maybe they make a lot and keep them warm so they can keep business flowing nicely.) Now onto the 2nd star of the show: KOOL-AID.  It was on the very very sweet side BUT that was fine because they bring cups of water to your table as well.  So I diluted mine a lil.   I WILL recommend this spot... I may have went on a slow day or just an off day. Where I got foods that were sitting waiting to be sold or even cooks were not feeling motivated and forgot to put their foot in everything.	4star
I love their pastas and fan of their service and more but come on! The portion is way too small and it gets smaller and smaller every time. It is not gonna cost you guys fortune to put little more carbs in our diet!	2star
Wandered into here one night because I booked the wrong date for the Comedy Cellar.  It was a bit pricey compared the the night out we were expecting at a comedy club but the food and service were excellent. We sat at the bar and the bartender made recommendations on food and drinks so it made it much easier.  My only complaint would be that there should be hooks under the bar for people to hang their stuff (Why haven't all bars added this handy little hook yet?). I had to balance myself on the bar stool while hanging onto my jacket and purse throughout my dinner. I wasn't offered a coat check, if there was a coat check somewhere in the cozy restaurant... Nevertheless, this is a cute little restaurant with a variety of choices.	4star
"HUGE fan of this place. People ask me all the time, ""What's your favorite restaurant in NY?"" It's SriPriPhai or Rubirosa. Those are the top. It's super hard to get reservations for Rubirosa. They let you reserve a few months in advanced and spots get filled up instantly. Wait times are usually 1-2 hours, but it's worth it. Plus, you're in the heart of soho. You might as well put your name down and explore the shops around Rubirosa before you get seated. Trust me, it's worth it.  We started with baked clams. They're a lot smaller than expected, but pretty delicious. Other alternatives is to get the rice balls, but again, it's very small. We ordered a large spaghetti and a large pie - half vodka half tie dye. The tie dye is worth the hype. It's fresh, moist, and the pesto is incredible. The vodka was slightly dry, but no complaints on that. The very thin crust pizza at Rubirosa is amazing... it really enhances all the flavors of the pizza.  And, the spaghetti! What a wonderful surprise. It was entirely simple, yet so full in flavor. I would have that again and again. The only reason why I gave Rubirosa a 4 star was because we had a rude server. Does not impact the food at all and maybe we were unlucky with the server, but besides the service, absolutely impeccable!"	4star
UGH. Food was so overpriced and bland. Can't believe I paid $80 for pasta and 2 glasses of wine.	2star

Really enjoyed their Chelsea market location, came to check it out and who says that you cant find decent food in tourist choked times square? Its a no frills spot with standing room only, you can get a choice of steak, pulled pork, chicken or cactus quesadilla, tacos and guac and chips. Service is fast, food is good, and for 3.50 - 5 dollars you can drop by for a quick snack with a corn taco. Tried their chicken, steak, pulled pork corn tacos and quesadilla. All were good, meat was tender and juicy, corn tacos were made in house, and there were pickled condiments line juice and sauce to balance out the salty meat. Many of the patrons were local office workers, didn't get the sense that there were a lot of tourists.  If you're wandering around time square craving for a snack Los Taco would be the place to be. I still prefer their Chelsea market location tho.	4star
"Very rude staff! Ordered for takeout and they BUTCHERED my order. I called back 3 times to fix it,(yes 3 times because not only did they mess up the order once, but AGAIN!)  The first time I was on hold for over 10 minutes, then got hung up on, called back and even then after the so called ""fix"" they sent out the wrong food and left half my order out. ::back to the phone:: The second time I was rushed off the phone before the guy could even fix the first mistake, once again leaving out half my order. Not to mention you get a busy tone forever when trying to get through, so the fact I got hung up on and had to waste additional time to fix THEIR mistake really pissed me off!. I will not be ordering here again! I didn't even bothering trying the food I was so disgusted with what was a simple task/phone call that no one took the time to do.  :::2 thumbs down!"	1star
This is a perfectly nice place, run by perfectly nice people, it was just very underwhelming... 2 of us shared 3 appetizers, 1 side and 1 main course, as well as an array of cocktails and wines. Our dinner was wayy over the top in terms of quantity and price (their steak was much larger than I thought it would be) but everything was so mediocre and unremarkable. The wine, the cocktails, the food (except for the steak) felt like airport restaurant food and absolutely nothing stuck with us and made us want to come back and try again.	2star
I was so excited to finally try Naive, as there are not too many restaurants on the south side of Williamsburg.  Plus, I love the open space look of the place.  After waiting forever to even be seated, much less see an actual employee, it took the longest time to even be looked at to be served.  The waiter was very curt and seemed pissed to be explaining what the happy hour options were.  When we finally got our oysters, they were literally crunchy like bits and pieces of the shells were in them.  My friends zucchini noodles were a joke.  Literally just spiral zucchini and half a cherry tomato.  She was so hungry she literally ate the other friends falafel burger's leftover tomatoes.  The service was incredibly slow and we were 1 of 2 tables there.  Plus, my friends were getting dripped on by some leak in the ceiling, but there was literally no A/C.  After waiting forever to be served, we seriously considered leaving and getting a chicken biscuit from Pies 'n' Thighs.  After this experience, we definitely should have jumped straight out of that ope window.  Have no idea why this place has good reviews.	1star
The longan juice was definitely not for us, an odd mix of herbal and cloying. Despite living nearby, we've oddly only been to the LI one, and sadly skipped the Crispy Chinese watercress salad here too, needing to cater to Americanized palates -- pad thai, pineapple fried rice...both of which were good for the dish.	4star
Tldr: noisy, slow service, bland food, overcharged me by $10 We came in towards the end of brunch after half the restaurant was already wasted and yelling at the top of their lungs. Not really the restaurant's fault, but just an observation. It was off to a poor start as every couple of seconds someone would release a shrieking laugh. I'm happy that you're having fun, but could you use your indoor laugh? Maybe the fact that I was completely sober made it unpleasant for me to be surrounded by a bunch of shouting drunks, who knows.  Anyway the service was very slow. We got the menus late, the waiter took our orders late, the food came out late, and the bill took forever as well. Even after I called the attention of several staff to bring the bill, it still took them about 10 minutes. Our waitress disappeared half way through our lunch, so that made it worse. The food itself was actually not that good either, maybe 2/5 stars. Our side order of potatoes came and they were bland, and undercooked. The steak was bland. The pork was dry.  This was a pretty bad experience and the four of us left very disappointed. I picked up the check, and since we were unhappy with the service that we got I left a $5 tip on a $94 bill, considering it fair. To my surprise, when I looked at my credit card transactions I saw that they charged me $109, instead of the $99 that I wrote down for the total. They added $10 to their tip! On top of the horrible service they also tried to steal $10 from me. I disputed the charge and hopefully will get that money back, but I'm sharing this story so that people are aware and check their statements after eating at this restaurant.	1star
The build-up preceding my first DiFara pizza experience was epic. How the pizza is created with the best possible ingredients, how the sauce is made, that the pizza gets topped with the freshest ingredients, so on and so forth. After giving my name and order, I hunkered down into my book ready for the wait time lore that eclipses the pizza lore, one hour on the average.  Two square pies, one regular -- no toppings for a mere ninety six dollars and zero cents. Ripoff. Then it began to rain which bothers me not, just gotta protect my literature, I watched others scrambled for cover -- but shelter was not to be found inside, the ragtag cardboard sign sorta legibly expresses. One hour and thirty minutes later, no pizza & no mention of my order from their tick tack toe design on a yellow legal pad told them. But a simple flip by any worker a page back clearly showed- -Glenn 2Sq 1Rg-- please know, I inquired three times during this wait, pointing to my order on the paper. Still, nobody had any clue why my pies hadn't gotten started at the one hour, fourty five minute wait. With 4 hours committed already including travel time, what choice did I have but to wait and take it. The pizza was finally served two hours and ten minutes later and it was low grade quality across the board. Everything explained to me about this place, clearly was from YEARS gone by.  DiFara is only a name. I'm still taken back by the experience and will never, ever return. Shameful.	1star
I've been to peaches several times for brunch. I was disappointed the last time I went with a friend for brunch and realized we were overcharged approximately $10.00. I went back the next day with my receipt and gave all of the information. I was told the manager would call me back. I called the next day for a follow up and was told the same thing. To this day I haven't heard from the manager. It's not the $10.00, it's  the principle . That was bad business. I know the manager received the message. He could have least returned the call. I will not be spending my money there anymore . There are more than enough restaurants in Bed-Stuy now to support. You just lost two customers and if you continue cheating customers you will lose more than that.	1star
Better than no BBQ I guess. Food is just average, but service is terrible. Waited 15 minutes after being seated before I was even acknowledged by a server, and it wasn't a busy time. Food arrived quickly, but that was the last time I saw a server until at least 10 minutes after I finished eating. Better ration your water, because you probably won't get a refill.  I might turn into a Halloween skeleton by the time I ever get my check.  Do yourself a favor and take the 1 train downtown to Hill Country Barbecue Market instead.	2star
I really really want to like this place!!! But I'm really annoyed, here's why.  I can literally this place from my window, I've been in once before and had amazing time. The food, service, and ambiance were all 5 stars, and it's great if you're coming to sit down and eat and that's it. Anything else is just too difficult apparently.  I came in wanted to sit at the bar and work on my computer - but they don't have wifi. So I left.  I called the next day and wanted a burger to go. I called at 10:57am, they open at 11am and the female who answered my phone refused to take my order until 11am. I understand that the kitchen makes those rules but she could've been a little nicer. I called 3 minutes later then came into pick up my burger. The place was empty and there was only one girl and 4 guys, I knew she knew I was the one that had called. She didn't make eye contact with me. She acted like I was an annoying customer that she wanted someone else to deal with. Girl, I just want my burger!! Next, I go to pay and they told me they have a $15 minimum for cards. My total was under $12. I hate spending my cash!! So I asked if I could add a coffee, and apparently they don't have to go coffee cups.  fine! Take my cash that I was keeping for laundry.  Somehow something I thought would be really simple turned into A THING.  Like I said, I had a great experience the one time I came in. I understand that I'm annoyed about policies, but sometimes a girl just needs her burger - no fuss.	2star
I came here because it was recommended to me. It's a nice restaurant which is what I was looking for instead of going to the city but I would have been better off. I had the beso chicken which I did enjoy. My friend had the steak which she complained wasn't cooked to her liking. We ordered the guacamole which was very bland. I would return as a last minute lunch idea and just go straight for the entree. The waiter was very pleasant!	3star
I've heard the lore of Lobster Pound for quite a long time so it was somewhat of a relief to finally check it out. As a native New Englander, I take matters of chowder and lobster with utmost seriousness. I was surprised that stopping by on a Sunday evening around 7 was a dicey move - we only got a table for 4 because someone else failed to show up for a reservation. It dwindled down from there, but I will definitely be reserving in the future. I wanted to test my three favorite dishes to see if the reputation was really warranted - clam strips, clam chowder, and of course a classic lobster roll. The strips were a hefty serving and made a great appetizer for four. Its rare to see them seasoned with anything in the batter, so the old bay flavoring was nice and made them zesty. The clam chowder was pretty great too. I always have a hard time finding good chowder in the city but this made me feel pretty close to being in Cape Cod. I'd come back again just for a bowl  (or two) of the chowder. And the lobster roll. The meat was plentiful, tasted very fresh, and overall the roll was great. I'm not sure I'd always shell out the ~$25 for a roll every time I went, but the other seafood was still more than enough reason to visit Lobster Pound over and over again. Washing it all down with a 'Gansett was the perfect end to a weekend.	4star
**This review is for their appetizers only. Did NOT try the ramen** Had a nice pre-dinner snack here and got to try a few of their appetizers.  - U&I bowl: ~$22 back in June if I remember correctly. Uni, ikura, and tuna were all very fresh.  The bowl itself was small, but that was expected. It was nice to share between two people, but I could easily finish the whole thing off by myself.  - Soft Shell Crab (special appetizer for the day): I really enjoyed this - battered and fried perfectly, and the sauce went well with it. - Tebasaki Gyoza: really juicy chicken and nicely breaded. Don't be scared - the chicken looks pink and undercooked in the dimly lit restaurant, but the waitress reassured us that it was b/c of the foie gras and that the chicken was fully cooked. My boyfriend really liked this one; I thought it was good, but the foie gras was a bit too heavy for me. The chicken was delicious though! Everything came out to about $60 before tip (super expensive snack), but it was definitely worth it to try.	4star
5 Stars for AMIBANCE! The food was tasty and the vibe was friendly and warm with all staff. I really like this place and recommend it for co-workers and groups of friends. People here are open to chat at the bar and the staff is welcoming and thorough. I didnt need a reservation and walked right in. The price was moderate (not cheap but not expensive)	5star
Hype Hype Hype! Soup dumplings were OK at best. The skin was kinda tough. Though, it looks like the dumplings were overcooked instead. FYI, if the skin sticks to the steamer or to each other, its likely the dumplings were overcooked. overcooked sink becomes sticky and tears really easily. Portion sizes were reasonably large. Each dumpling was bigger than the spoon. Mostly soup and skin, not too much filling. The dumplings were not made that well either. A couple of them opened up while steaming so the soup just all leaked out (probably cuz it was over cooked).  The crab filling still had bits of crab shell. Other than that, all the other dishes were mediocre.  The sliced beef noodle soup was bland. The noodles were a tad too hard and chewy.  The sesame chicken had way too much batter. Some of the batter wasn't fully cooked. I guess Joe's Shanghai is one of those NYC tourist locations milking as much of their own mythology as much as they can before it's gone. Bottom line, this place is just another old school tired restaurant. If you care for soup dumplings, you can definitely find better places, cheaper places, more interesting places, more authentic places in NYC.	2star
Extremely busy. I had never heard of this restaurant but by the crowd outside you could tell it's the spot to go to in Harlem. Unfortunately the law of supply and demand is in full practice here because the prices are a little high for the food being served. I had a version of fried chicken (20ish dollars) with a glass of sangria. Service by the wait staff wasn't too great but the hostess was extremely friendly. Not sure if I'll be back for dinner.	3star
Seriously underwhelming experience. I've had my eye on this place for a while as I am a huge fan of authentic Japanese breakfasts but never bothered trekking out to brooklyn for this. Drove out on my day off and I can only say this place was a huge let down. I guess something that is based purely off hype and with clienteles that look like they wouldn't be able to appreciate the difference in details, nothing will be changed anytime soon.  Why my opinion counts? While I have never actually lived in Japan, I did spend half my life in Asia and I've been to Japan over 25 times as my mother was born and raised in Japan; collectively my time spent in Japan has been over 1.5 years. I am not only fluent in the language, I am also fluent in the culture.  Review: short on time right now so I'll elaborate later. Food was mediocre as everything is pre-made and merely heated prior to serving. Very standard Japanese breakfast. Given that it is the same in Japan, I give them 3-4 stars for the food.  What really disappointed me was the experience. Just compare the quality of the service at a restaurant like Okonomi with a full Caucasian waitstaff to that of something like Jukai that is owned/manage/operated by a full Japanese staff and you will see the huge lack in details in the service. I deduct 4 stars for the typical service you expect from any other restaurant in Brooklyn. It wasn't horrible but so far off from the Japanese sensibility I was expecting. I guess it's just in the culture and cannot be taught (not being racist here; if you've ever been to Japan, you would know EXACTLY what I'm talking about). They don't take reservations so it is about 1-1.5 hour wait time. The food comes out in about 5 min and takes you 15 min to eat. Round trip from Manhattan by car takes 1.5 hrs without traffic. So your looking at spending 3hrs to get food that takes you 20 min to eat. Will I drive from Manhattan to try this again? Very very very very unlikely. Will I recommend this place to friends? Hell no; they know I have better secret Japanese spots in the city.  What really blew my mind, and I know your gonna criticize this minor detail but, when we were done paying for our meal and was heading out, not a single person said thank you, come again, or even あけましておめでとうございます given today they were serving osechi ryori.	1star
Walking on Smith st in the rain, I Yelped for some grub and saw Uglyduckling with 4*'s and quickly crossed the street. First impression, maybe my concept of 'gastropub' is totally off. I wasnt expecting it to be spacious and restuarant-y. But as that rain turned to snow, and we was hungry-bordering-hangry, : there's tv's, it's March madness they have food. It's cool.  A couple of things make this review 3stars and I'm kinda leaning toward 2 and a half.  The restaurant itself must be very new. The staff must be first job kinda people, but I can't really be sure only bc the millenial feel of the whole neighborhood just might be the entitled problem.  But I digress, I ordered the Braised short Rib tacos and I do admit they were tasty. Presentation needs a bit of oomph. 3 soft tacos on a plate with some kimchi looking onion. Meh.  My plus 1 ordered the chicken and waffles sandwich with came with these shoestring fries that were a nice texture, hopefully they were house made but I didn't see anywhere that was stated so, assume frozen.  Sandwich sounded so good on the menu. The chicken itself, should it be a little spicier? There was a pink spot in the piece I had and there were spots on it that seemed like fatty bites. The waffle got soggy on the bottom half. The bacon was good and peppery. We both say, this place is just ok. I only ordered 1 drink and although it was a nice mix of tart and sweet, I didn't taste a lick of alcohol.	3star
One star for the piss poor service. First in line and dude did not give me a number during the 10 minute wait. Finally ready to pick up my pie and guy said wait as my number was 8. Bruh I should have gotten 1 but since you don't give AF you gave me the worst possible number. Terrible service	1star
The narrow space summons for wine bars to lower anchor at this 5th Ave. Park Slope post. I would vastly prefer to stay in Brooklyn for wine bars, but with other wine experiences in different cities, this wine-stead is less than Top Ramen. I can usually be assuaged by a nice decor and ambiance, but nothing jived for this time.	3star
I'd never been here before, and was looking quickly through Yelp for restaurants with outdoor seating and great reviews. I had my toddler in tow, and wanted some fresh air.  Brookvin came up at the top of the list, and I headed there.  When I discovered there were no high chairs, I asked if it was a child-friendly restaurant, and was given a wishy-washy answer. I would have much, much preferred that they said that they were not a kid-friendly establishment.  In short, do not come here with kids that can not sit in their chairs quietly. Otherwise the wait staff will give you dirty looks when our child acts like - well - a child.	1star
Yikes. I can't believe this place is even considered a restaurant. The bar is nice and has pretty good options but the food is awful. I don't even know how anyone can go wrong with BBQ but they did. Completely over-priced. Mac and Cheese was dry and BBQ was chewy and under seasoned.	1star
Like all new Brooklyn outdoor spots the crowd is 60% adult 25% kid & 15% dog. Now seeing kids side up to their parents at the bar is a distinctly Brooklyn thing. This is a concrete beach and amazing alfresco space. Also, the Bbq sauces wow. That's where the accolades end. The crew behind this bbq mash up is impressive but the food disappoints.  Ate: Hatchet vinegar wings w/ Alabama white sauce Vinegar purple slaw Deviled eggs The wings were tasty, but dry. The slaw was fine and the eggs were a big untasty yawn. All sides were pre made & packaged in plastic( food turn-off) The sauces on the other hand were top notch & plentiful- Alabama white, righteous red, mustard. Bubby's you have nothing to worry about in the deviled eggs department. I'm sure the food tastes better, when your drunk- hint, hint.	3star
The food is mediocre at Best. its ok if your local  and you live close by do not travel for this place. Also its a semblance of spanish food.	2star
This place was huge and packed! It was much more than a restaurant... they have a whole marketplace, bakery, deli counter, grocery store, produce, a Nutella cafe and another restaurant upstairs. Fresh pizza, pasta, gelato - and likely carry or make every Italian food item you could hope for. - We waited about 30 minutes to get a table, but there were plenty of things to check out in store/market - Freshly baked bread, with samples - You can buy wine / beer and drink it here!! - Great service  - Fresh food, you can tell the food was freshly made in-house I had the housemade Tagliatelle with Short Rib ragu - it was $23. Very filling and meaty. Overall, it was a bit overpriced on some things, but worth a visit. An interesting and unique place to check out.	4star
Very wrong i called for pickup Louis is the name she told me to hurry up because the kitchen is about to close and then try calling back she said for order!! That's not nice i'm still a customer;(thumbs down on this;(	2star
This place was unfortunately a real disappointment. I really loved seersucker and was excited to try a new place by its creators but I seriously doubt I will be going back to WJ. Clearly plenty of other people felt differently but I'm honestly shocked to read how much people are saying they liked the chicken. I guess I'm just not a fried chicken expert? 1)know before you go that the menu is 90% chicken. They do have burgers and a bunch of sides but do not expect any real variety. It's basically fried chicken all around.  2) it is incredibly greasy and oily. Of course nobody goes for fried chicken if they want to be healthy but this was more oily then your standard fast food chicken sandwich. It also felt heavily breaded with more skin than meat. 3) portions are tiny. I ordered the chicken sandwich on a potato roll and a side of coleslaw and left hungry. I don't have a huge appetite and and a smallish woman in her 30s, but this really didn't fill me up for lunch. 4) possibly the only place on Smith Street that doesn't have a brunch menu. The menu is the same all the time. They also don't have iced coffee or skim milk. I realize that sounds stupidly picky but it all adds up to more of a low-budget lunch counter feel--if that's what you're in the mood for then go for it but otherwise don't waste your time 5)ultimately the biggest problem was the taste was just not that interesting. There was no real flavor and it wasn't crispy at all like another reviewer indicated.  I figured all other stuff aside the chicken is probably out of this world but it just wasn't.  Honestly I prefer the Wendy's spicy chicken sandwich over wilma jeans chicken sandwich -- okay so I do have a soft spot for Wendy's but my point is that the food quality was similar to fast food. Overall the restaurant was a real letdown.  I like the idea of a southern inspired menu without all the frills and nonsense but I think they went a little too far in the opposite direction here.	2star
"This is regarding a misdelivery. The person who picked up the phone regarding a missing item in our delivery was extremely rude and discourteous. He even cursed at me about the missing order, saying that ""they had nothing to do with it."" Absolutely terrible customer service. Also, the food is not even that good OR authentic. Never ordering from this establishment again."	1star

I was not sure how this place was going to be since the surrounding area didn't look so great...but to my surprise the restaurant was very nice inside.  The host was very nice and the waitstaff was pretty good.  The food tasted very good...i had some risotto dish for apptz. and it tasted sooo good and for the main dish..organic chicken dish..the portion was pretty good... also tasted good.  bf enjoyed his meal as well! yes..we would go back!	3star
Got here early enough on a Wednesday night at 6:20pm. We had a party of 3 that was going to grow to 4 in an hour- so they tried to seat us in a corner for 3 people, but I asked for a table for 4. I could see that they were trying to squeeze everyone in, but thankfully the host eventually accepted my persistent requests. And within a half hour, the place was completely packed. So yeah, get here early. Chic decor. The service was impeccable- constantly refilling your water, and our waiter was so helpful, asking about allergies and explaining every dish perfectly.  FOOD: Truffle Mac and Cheese: I usually eschew getting mac and cheese at restaurants, but this one had an ample amount of truffle oil, and was delicious. The gruyere cheese was fantastic. Eel Taco: Spot on. Tender and well-seasoned. Wish it was bigger though (alas, always the downside of tapas-style). Mapo Tofu: I was especially excited for this one because it has CHORIZO. But using the tortilla chips with it didn't really work for me (and I LOVE tortilla chips). Maybe it's the Korean in me; I would've preferred it with rice ;) Still, good spice and good balance with the daikon radish. Kimchi Paellea: Lived up to the advance billing. Creamy and tasty, and the smoked mussels were great. Didn't really get much kimchi flavor, though. Pork Belly Chicharron: Good, but maybe I expected more because of my great love of pork belly. The cashew creme was not my cup of tea, and there should have been more of it anyway. Steak: Nice symphony with the grits and kale. Steak was cooked well, tender and sliced thin. Should be back sometime!	4star
"I walked into Ippudo west at 7pm on a Thursday night. The last thing I expected was for the place to be packed like the DMV 30 mins before closing. After putting myself on the list for a table and was told that the wait would be over an hour I Decided to make Ippudo plan B and try to find something decent to eat in the neighborhood. After walking around the block and sitting down in another Asian spot that we realized was rated horridly I received a text that said ""your table will be ready soon"". Saved By the text! We left the questionable eatery and rushed over to Ippudo to claim our seats. Extra points to Ippudo for handling their reservations so efficiently. Had it not been for the texts they send we may have never got the chance to experience what this place has to offer.    I like the setup in this place. It's a small space but they are using every square foot of it well. In the front is a dimly lit bar that was pretty lively with people drinking cocktails and enjoying pork buns and other appetizers. The back part of Ipuddo is like a portal to a Tokyo noodle house. Within seconds of being back there you hear the wait staff yelling commands to each other in Japanese. The restaurant has a very minimalist design but every small detail ties in to its Japanese theme (like the chopsticks resting on smooth rocks).  They do an excellent job of taking you to the orient as you dine for that 45 mins.   The Ramen: Excellence, awesomeness & deliciousness a bowl. I ordered the Karaka Men ramen. This ramen soup had an optimal spice level and perfect balance of flavors. It had just enough spice to satisfy my craving for heat without overpowering the other flavors in the soup. All of this dishes ingredients worked together harmoniously to comprise one of the most delectable dishes I have had in recent memory. Every bit of The Broth, Noodles & pork in this ramen were enjoyable. The scallions that abundantly topped the soup provided a savory & crisp contrast to the otherwise soft ingredients in the dish. Simply put, the Karaka Men ramen was perfect. Its perfection was confirmed by the fact that I had absolutely no urge to add salt, pepper, soy sauce or sriracha.   My night at Ippudo was one of those first ballot Five star experiences. Everything was executed flawlessly. The staff was helpful and seemed to be enjoying their jobs. The food was unforgettable and I enjoyed the ambiance thoroughly. 1 hour waits are annoying anywhere but they handled it as efficiently as possible so that's a plus for them. I always strive to mention the pros and cons of a place when I review it no matter how much I like the place. As I recall my experience from last night in order to complete this review I can't think of one negative thing to mention. Whoever is orchestrating this operation knows what they're doing. based on last night, Ipuddo has become the default ramen spot in my restaurant rotation. I will be back soon to try appetizers and cocktails and will update with more details."	5star
Perhaps the Happy Hour. There is something to that, generally.  Very decent venue, understood as 'place', as bar & restaurant. But the dining is on autopilot, at the very best, and can be something of a chore. Some waiters are better, more attentive (and less chatty), than others. At a last encounter, our table waited ten minutes for menus, fifteen minutes for a waiter to take our order. Bread only arrived after we asked for it twicely. Dinner for four, off the regular menu, took 35 minutes to arrive after ordering. It wasn't busy. (Were they angling for us to order another round of drinks?) I've had brunch, dinner and all the rest here. Much of the food is very decent. The risotto is excellent and the ribs are good. My last pork chop was big, but even so too dried out and overpriced at $28 for a single pork chop (please note, the menu reads plural, 'chops'). The hamburger, which I've tried twice, thinking the first probably a fluke, looks good, but the meat has no taste other than to be somewhat oily.  In short, I think they are trying to get away on their good looks: a restaurant looks a certain way, and you assume quite a lot, and perhaps upgrade your experience in your own mind, even if the actual fare and service are not quite up to the caliber of the décor. As for the bar, taps are perfectly unremarkable (if that's your thing, try nearby Ted's). There are no buybacks, a venerable NY tradition honoring the faithful customer, or other discounts outside the happy hour. Cocktails work, but no one should confuse this with a craft cocktail bar.  As for the autopilot, it seems Hendriks is the Tesla of midtown. I'm stuck, sometimes, because I live and work in the area.... and with friends who insist on nearby, I am not often in the driver's seat. So I 'passenger up' to the bar or table here, with apathy if not misgivings. UPDATE: I appreciate the civil responses of Jack P., who is apparently the owner. But if you read them for yourself, he really dismisses me (nicely: 'probably don't come back!'):  not a thing I wrote seemed to resonate enough with him to suggest he'd look into or improve it. To this, all I can say is check the place out for yourself and see whether you have a similar experience as me and if so, talk to Jack P. or write it up here.	2star
"I went here with my wife today, hoping to get a little something to eat and some drinks, with a view of The Lake in Central Park. The view/ambience were there thing worthwhile. We waited for over an hour, which ended up not being worth it. We got sparkling water instead of flat, which tasted like it came right out of the lake...not worth the up charge at all. They next brought bread around, which they had a variety and allowed you to choose from a basket, which is a nice touch. The bread was stale and flavorless, very disappointing. I ordered ""The Mule"" to drink, which was their take on a Moscow Mule. It was really strong and didn't have much flavor other than that of alcohol, I don't recommend it. My wife and I didn't want too much to eat, and just wanted to split the chicken salad. The waiter told us that we had to order at least 1 dish each, which it did not say anywhere on the menu. He was pretty rude about it too. Anyway, we complied, and got the crab cake appetizer as well. The crab cake was ok, pretty meaty, but was almost cooked to a crisp. It was small for the cost ($20) but generally had a good flavor. It took a while for our salad to come out and service was generally slow. The salad was mediocre at best and expensive ($25). It was cabbage based with a little lettuce, chicken, peanuts, and some dressing. The lettuce and cabbage were wilted and the chicken dry. Long story short, with all of the great restaurants in NY, you can 10x better for a fraction the cost. Don't waste your time or money."	2star
All my friends were telling me how good By Chloe is. Well... not a fan.  The lady who took my order is very inattentive. She was chatting with other staff while taking my order. When I asked about the lemonade's flavor, she simply ignored the question.  Food wise, the classic burger was the driest burger I ever had. It was so dry that the wrapping paper stays dry as well. There weren't much flavor in it, either.Very blend , even for veggie burger. The raspberry lemonade was too sweet for my taste. Not sure I tasted the lemonade part. The air fries were okay. Not greasy of course but a little bit soggy and salty.	2star

This was my 3rd visit to Basta Pasta and my first in nearly a year. To be candid, I haven't been back sooner as my last visit ended in a case of food poisoning. However, I did want to be fair and try BP again, while focusing on their clear specialty...pasta. We started with the scallop appetizer which was one of the daily specials. On the positive side, the taste was amazing. The scallops were tender,  perfectly seasoned and paired with braised brussel sprouts which were wonderful. The only downside was that there were only 3 scallops and they were clearly on the small side... certainly not as plump as traditional diver scallops. Regardless it was a solid appetizer. For my main, I had the linguine pescatore with red sauce. The linguine was al dente and the seafood (clams, mussels, squid and shrimp) were all cooked to perfection....I was very happy with my choice and actually wished the portion was slightly larger.  For dessert we shared the tiramisu which was quite good.  Overall, service is good. However, one always feels a bit rushed at BP as the hostess and wait staff are regularly scanning the dining room to check status and turn their tables as quickly as possible. In summary, I'm glad that I gave BP another try and I do like the food. However, taking the entire experience into account in concert with the price point, I'm not in a rush to head back.	3star
This place is nice, love the interior. I came here for a birthday dinner for a friend of mines. We couldn't be seated until the whole party was there. In the mean time I got a drink at the bar. The bartender took so long to assist me she was focusing on one side of the bar, that made me annoyed. The food took long but it was good thing we had a lot to talk about. I like the place overall I would like to give it another try before giving a higher rating	3star
"Let me preface this by saying that as a local New Yorker and Italian American who has lived in Italy, my review will be a little more fine tuned than the average bear. Respectfully, I'm not a tourist staying at the hotel passing through from the Midwest whose Italian food frame of reference is Ragu sauce out of the can or Chef Boyardee. I will say that the ambiance is excellent and the service has the potential to be very good. It's in a quaint little area tucked away on Stone Street in the financial district. When you walk in, it is warm and inviting and they make you feel at home. They are attentive, though they seem to struggle communicating with each other. With so many people ""sweeping"" your table, our orders were mixed up and I sometimes felt rushed to get the order in, having to answer the same questions to multiple servers. Case in point, they actually brought the entrees out first before the appetizers. It was an honest mistake, we laughed about it, and no big deal, though I have to say that in all my years working in restaurants and fine dining establishments and eating out, I'd never seen that once.  The calamari that we ordered was chewy, and a major disappointment. I'm sorry but if you're touted as a top Italian restaurant with 4.5 stars on Yelp, shame on you for screwing up calamari. If it's fried it should be crispy and light. There are pizzerias in my town that do a better job. The server, who shall remain nameless, seemed to have a little bit of an attitude. I asked him what his favorite pasta dish was. He said it was one of their pastas with salmon. When I then told him I wasn't a big fan of salmon on pasta, he looked like he was kind of annoyed and didn't offer me an alternative option. They had a bolognese dish on the menu. I wanted to order that and asked him if they would put a dollop of mascarpone cheese on top. It's delicious this way and offers a great contrast to the meat sauce. He then told me they don't have mascarpone cheese. I found this to be an odd response because one of their desserts was tiramisu, whose main ingredient calls for mascarpone. This means that that he was either lying or the tiramisu is not made on the premises. Neither alternative is representative of a high end restaurant with ""4.5 stars."" Needless to say, we didn't order the tiramisu for dessert lol.  I will say that my girlfriend's ravioli alla vodka was very good, and the sauce was tasty, though they didn't offer any bread to soak up the excess sauce outside of the one piece they gave us when we initially sat down which she had already eaten. I'm sure they would have given us more bread had we asked for it, but again, at ""4.5 stars"" why should we have to ask?  Desserts were underwhelming. Said tiramisu looked dry and limp. Perhaps it was from the lack of marscarpone (hehe). They had a handful of different panna cottas. We tried one. It was decent, but nothing to write home about. All in all this is a good Italian restaurant but I wouldnt say its deserving of its ranking. They do a fine job of catering to the tourists coming through the hotel and put out some nice pastas. If I'm staying in the area I'd certainly be open to going back but for the price and with so many top notch Italian restaurants in the area, I wouldn't seek it out."	3star
I don't know why would there be so many good reviews about this place.  The curry is ok, but very disappointed about the ingredients. I order the seafood curry: there are only 2 shrimps, 4-5 fish cakes, 1 imitating crab, no vegetables. Comes with a big plate of noodles which I only ate 1/3 of it. My friend ordered dried noodle with chicken and Asian pancake, the Asian pancake is like reheated frozen Asian pancake.  The entire dinner is fat+high sodium+carbohydrate, therefore I only ate 1/3 of my food.  Server forgot things all the time. But this place is cheap, maybe ok for take out but I won't come back again.  Btw, when I left the restaurant, I saw another dine-in customer was complaining to the waitress how come the ingredients are so disappointing, no veggies, so few tofu, etc.	1star
I expected a whole lot better given the rave reviews Lombardi has gotten over the years on Yelp. I was excited that we only had to wait 15-20 minutes to be seated for this NYC Mecca for pizza lovers. Pies are pricey, service was lacking as was the flavor in the sauce. My high expectations were not met with the first, second, or third bites. Pretty disappointing for a foodie.  The original margherita pizza with pepperoni, mushroom, and sausage is my favorite, anywhere else, not here. It just didn't do it for me. I'll skip the hassle of getting to Lombarti's next time I'm in town. We honestly had a better pie at a random mom and pop shop on our last trip to the city. Sorry, close but no cigar.	3star
Worst service ever. Waited over an hour and never got out food. Manager Christine was rude and very unprofessional. They don't care about their patrons. Stay away!!	1star
This place is so Amazing!!! My best friend and I dined here last week and it is our new favorite place to go. Can be a little on the pricey side but so worth it! Exquisite! Highly recommend!!!	5star
Horrid service.  Took over 15 minutes for them to take my order and there were only 3 other parties when I arrived.  BEWARE: They don't tell you before you come in and there is no sign posted anywhere, they only accept cash or American Express.  I think it's worth telling you're customers that when they arrive before trading them.	1star
Visited this place coz of all the reviews over yelp but honestly , didn't find it that great. It had same kind of American bar food- calamari and blah blah.. didn't even taste great. ambience is whatever . Waiters looked very bored . Maybe coz of my time , I went there in the evening around 5 or 6pm. Anyhoo , I wouldn't come back ever .	2star
"Had ""The Maine..."", err, umm, can't remember what it was called...The Maine Trio maybe? But I do remember that it was caught by the fishing net cast by mediocrity.   ""The Maine"" whatever it's called, was three halves of various rolls: shrimp, crab and, the obligatory, lobster. The shrimp and crab were nothing to write home (or Yelp) about, but the lobster roll, true to the reputation that precedes it, was nothing short of delicious. However, it would not be my go-to for Lobster Rolls, moving forward."	3star
It's a small place but nice decor and friendly servers. Went here last week ago with my boyfriend. The drinks and foods were delicious! Would definitely come back for sure.	5star
The original halal guys before they started to franchise... So, I've been eating here for years, when they only had maybe one or two other locations. Food was absolutely wonderful. Whenever coming to see the Christmas tree in Manhattan making a stop here was a must. Recently since they started to franchise the food just isn't as good as it used to be. It's not bad, but it used to be better. Also notice the amount of grease in your frying pan when warming up your platter the day after. It's a ton. A few years ago I wouldn't even consider a different platter place when in Manhattan but since this place isn't as great as it used to be, I think I'll venture out and try new things.	3star
Are you kidding me? I ordered delivery and 1. The drink was missing provided they charge $3 for a can of Diet Coke. 2. The soup was so salty and lacks natural aromatic smell and made me feel sick even after 3 hours. 3. The ramen was RAW. I understand ramen restaurants probably cook noodles 30 secs shorter for delivery noodles, but dude the noodle was RAW and extremely firm. 4. For $16, they give you 2 thin slice of pork, one of which was all fat. 5. The seasoned egg is good though.  The worst ramen I have had in NYC. Period.	1star
"Pizza tempura. Pizza tempura! As an item of food, it was terrible: two uneven hunks of pizza (the frozen kind) that were oil-logged and had somehow missed on all its glorious potential. But, it's DEEP FRIED PIZZA on a Japanese pub menu...! Always be true to yourself. For years, Sake Bar Hagi has been a favorite, viewed as a ""hidden Japanese izakaya basement gem etc. etc. for those in the know."" Here's my opinion: it's an OK place to go if you are trapped in this (frankly, awful) area and have a *serious* craving for izakaya food - the same way you might have a *serious* craving for a burger, and someone gives you a spongy McDonald's thing and you're like ""yessss thank god."" Chicken nanban (chicken cutlet with Japanese-style tartar sauce) was soggy and greasy, but admittedly hit the spot. Large portion.  Agedashi tofu (fried tofu in dashi broth) was very bland. Large portion. Soggier than usual.  Fried geso (squid legs) on the specials menu was quite tiny, oversalted. Not that this should be a strong indicator of much, but neither staff nor customers are Japanese. The space certainly has the energy of someplace as close to Times Square as it is - filled with tourists who carefully select ramen and fried rice. Do know that the food is mediocre and the beer runs freely ($5 Kirin pints). We came in around 10pm on a Saturday and didn't wait, but the place was full. There's nowhere in the actual restaurant space to loiter, so they may tell you to wait outside if no tables are available. Rest assured that you won't miss much by giving up and going elsewhere."	2star
Checked this place out yesterday, a Saturday evening. The line was pretty long, but moved rather quickly. I ordered the pork, chicken and beef tacos. Pretty basic, they fill it with onions, meat, cheese and lettuce. Then there are sauces you can add yourself from the counter. However, was a bit hard to grab sauce and condiments because it's placed where people are all crowding as they wait for their food. They need to figure out a better space solution. As far as the food it was pretty good, tasty and seemed fresh, although portions I felt were small. I'm a small girl and three tacos later I was not full, but still tasty.	4star
The portions aren't huge. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, just how I like my pasta.	4star
This poor review primarily focuses on the Ssam burrito which is kimchi and beef short rib wrapped in rice paper. I haven't tried anything else but don't doubt it's tasty, but this burrito was awful. The blend of flavors don't compliment at all and the short rib tasted bland. This should be taken off the menu, I finish everything I eat and couldn't bear it... The staff and service was good and friendly so no qualms about the establishment itself	2star
It's sad for me to write this by perhaps management should pay attention and realize the lunch bartender from today Tuesday is absolutely horrible. I've been a loyal guest visiting this place quiet often but today was absolutely horrible. This tall skinny guy has no business in the hospitality business.  It's so sad !	1star
This place is very interesting. First of all, I am new to Filipino food so eveything is interesting to me. The food taste great! It can be a little bit expensive for the portion. But I can see it is a great place to hangout with friends.	4star
Horrible!! Hostess is sweet. Everybody else is either high or slow for i dont know what reason .	1star
- No reservations - Wait quote was very off. Party of 4 was quoted 1.5 hours and we were seated in 45 minutes. Not complaining here...  - There's a big patio in the back where you can grab a drink and order to go pizzas. - Great pizza in a sketchy area with lots of hipsters. Worth it.  - Get the Bee Sting pizza. It's the perfect mix of savory and hint of sweetness. - Service - Couple issues here but rating is on the food.	4star
We went there for a business dinner; I know this restaurant from Philly, where Steven Starr owns a dozen of different restaurants. This one is a new opening in NYC and similar to Philly. Start off at the fancy bar with some drinks, then the waitress will lead you down to the dinning area with chandeliers. We are primarily appetizers (duck salad, tuna sashimi, fried shrimp, grilled tenderloin, lobster fried rice and dumplings) all delicious. Will be back either to this or the one in Philly.	4star
I have such a hard time finding restaurants that serve lobster exclusively or that is worth while. After much thought and careful consideration, not to mention the reviews from fellow yelpers, I decided to give this place a try. It was pretty packed for a Thursday. The wait was about 30 minutes but the hostess text you when they have your table. The girls and the guys at the host stand were very friendly and outgoing.  My server was very disoriented and confused by me telling him I want a a lobster roll and whole lobster. Me think he was on drugs or something but anyway once I placed my order it literally took 5 minutes for the food to come out which is a plus.  Now the food it was just okay to me. It wasn't hot to begin with which means it probably was just sitting there but bc I was starving I didn't waste no time tearing it up. My lobster must've been on the grill for literally 3.5 minutes -wayy too undercooked for me. There were grilled marks on it but it wasn't grilled all the way through. I would've enjoyed it if it was more charred and seasoned more. My lobster roll was cold and for some reason my server couldn't understand when I asked for drawn butter on the side (sos you know??) I couldn't enjoy it bc I prefer my lobster rolls warm so that sucked. The fries were good they definitely taste like McDonald's fries. Would I return? I would want to but only if the food is better.	4star
I was excited about this place because it was on the water and I heard some great things about this place.  Arrived and went straight to the bar for some drinks.  Selection wasn't bad at all and the staff was quick to get the drinks and very friendly. After a couple of drinks at the bar went over to my table to have some lunch.  Ordered a dozen oysters which were good and tasty.  Then after we had the ceviche and a lobster roll w some chips.  Everything was delicious but the lobster roll was quite small and for the price of $26 I would expect a little bigger.  The lobster roll seemed like it was on a hot dog bun.  I would come back to try some other items on the menu.  When the weather is nice outside you can't beat the views and great weather	3star
Fantastic apres-work cocktail and nibbles place. I normally can't stand mid-town Manhattan, especially around Times Square and the theatre district. Just too much craziness going on and I hate having to walk through it. After reading the reviews here, I wanted to check it out and seriously, if you like cleverly-named and yummy cocktails, this is a great spot.  I had the sliders (OK) and the garlic fries (to die for and the best I've had outside of California) with the Ginger Rogers cocktail. Generous and yummy, the crowd here is also pretty cool and laid-back and the waitress I had was also really nice. I hope tourists don't find this place because it's great as it is.	5star
The place is adorable and perfect for a date night.  I have wanted to try Alta for the longest time and since we were in the neighborhood, we decided to give it a shot.  We didn't mind sitting at the bar and found two spots not long after we arrived. The service was good but the food wasn't what I expected although the presentation was very nice. We had the anchovies, paella, shrimp and lamb tagine. Nothing really stood out enough for me that would make me want to come back again.	2star
I really wanted to like Junior's. When you walk up it is busy and has a great vive by the theatre district. The workers are friendly and helpful. They are known for their cheesecakes. I ended up getting a pastrami/corned beef sandwich in their take out area.  I guess I expected more. Being that I am a fan of kosher deli's in NYC, I expected a more hearty sandwich with ample meat. Nope. Meat was also not as flavorful.	2star
"Couldn't even eat here because we were waiting for ten minutes to be seated. It was not that the place was busy because there were tons of tables available but that the host just never helped us. He originally said ""one minute"" or something to that end and after that completely ignored us and several other people behind us who were waiting, too. Terrible, rude service. I don't care how good the food is, I don't need to try this hard just to get you to take my money. What a shame."	1star
This is a busy place , food is good. Ordered the popular choices, roasted mushroom was a little salty, other than that it's good. Also ordered roasted beets and veggi spaghetti.  Veggie Veggie :)	4star
Walked in here because a friend and I got hungry. The atmosphere was very interesting. Punk rock music was playing in the background, and there was cool painting on the wall. They don't do by the slice orders, they only do full pies, which was okay but when you're on a budget and trying to eat cheap, you don't really want a whole pie. The cheapest pie is $12 or so and it comes with no cheese, so immediately we opted for the next option which was margarita ($16). All pies are about 12 inches around. We ate the pie in the nice outdoors area right next door. Overall the pizza was great, would definitely recommend to anyone in the area, atmosphere, and service were great too.	5star
A gem on the UES serving fresh homemade pasta with a variety of delicious and equally fresh and homemade sauces. Pastas range from $9-12 dollars and they offer soft drinks and sparkling water. Counter seating seats 6 people.  A father and daughter-run establishment absolutely worth checking out. Hunter students, come here!!	5star
The food was great!! I love the Red Curry with beef and Mango Sticky Rice. We came on a weekday afternoon at about 5. It was quite and the owner came out to talk to us and gave us free Thai Tea!	5star
I really wanted to love this place. I really did. In fact, I came here twice within a week because I loved my experience here the first time, I decided to bring my mother the second time to show her how much I love this place (and I never take my mom out to dinner). The food was delicious. There were two problems: - I found a metal wire in my food that's about an inch long. I didn't find it by looking at my food, but I chewed on it, and I felt something hard in my mouth thinking it was a bone -- but it was a metal wire. I showed my mom in horror, but she didn't want to bring it up to the servers because she didn't want to have any drama. I should have taken a picture of it, but the server took away an empty dish with the wire on it. Thankfully I didn't get any lacerations in my mouth because of the wire, but... how unappetizing. - After I got my change, a waitress (not even the one that served us for most of the day) kinda straight up asked me for tip while I was leaving. First off, we left a generous amount (~18% tip) on the table. Second, I really didn't want to tip after being served a wire. I really really really want to love you Wok Wok, but I'm really disappointed.	1star
I was truly excited to try this place out after seeing all the ravishing reviews and high ratings. So off the bat I did have high expectations.  First of all, if I can only choose one cuisine to eat for the rest of my life it would be Thai food. After trying this place out It was a Total Miss. I'm Super disappointed because I thought it would end my hunt for the best Thai restaurant in the city.  The royal pad thai, what's so royal about it? It majorly lacked in spices and in flavor! I think the royal family would agree with me...Wasn't too impressed with the egg netting either. I've had this presentation before in other restaurants, which at least gave it a little flavor. This one didn't.  The panang chicken curry with a request to make it spicy was just mild. I had to use the curry to give the pad thai some flavor. By this time, I wanted to ask them for a spice rack. Mind you, I don't eat super spicy food. Just enough to tickle my palate. On the upside I did enjoy the curry puff pastries, which went well with the sweet vinegar cucumber salad type dipping sauce. I also loved my beverage called samui. It brought me back to Thailand's sunny white sand beach & clear water while drinking a piña colada.... On my way out I was happy to see they were wiping down the menus. I think menus are one of the most filthy things to touch right alongside a door handle. Tip: tables on second floor looked more private try to reserve those tables	3star
My best friend loves coming here for soup dumplings and won't stop coming here. I personally believe the soup dumpling skin is really thick here compared to Kung Fu Xiao Long bao. Nonetheless, the food is really good here. We ordered: Crab and pork soup dumplings (4/5) A little too dry Pork soup dumplings (5/5) Always a go-to choice Rice cake with beef (5/5) Good portions with mushroom and lettuce Scallion pancake (5/5)  MUST GET, the bread is cooked too fluffiness	4star
Just walked in at 9:25pm on a Sunday night for them to tell me the kitchen closes at 9:30. Yet the website and hours say 10pm. Very rude and unprofessional. Sad. Food is good but service not worth.	1star
New thai restaurant on Nostrand ave and since Brooklyn is the new up and coming hit commodity had to check this place out. Nice cozy ambiance, menu had a decent variety. It's BYOB as well. My friend and I ordered the spring rolls and i had the green curry really flavourful, not salty, good portions.  Menu pricing really reasonable. Why I won't give it 5 stars my host wasn't very attentative and messed up the payments for the bill. Overall, I will return.	4star
I have been to this restaurant many times over the years and have been satisfied but today walking in there for lunch I'm not sure if management changed or the core values to satisfy the customers have been thrown out with the trash but this has had to be the worst dining experience I have ever had. Food came out cold ( volcano chicken , rice) . The drink I ordered was supposed to be a spicy drink with jalapeños in it and didn't I had to help him make the drink and that doesn't include the 10 minute wait at 12:30pm for someone to acknowledge us at our table. I'm not sure what's going on but if this continues I doubt they will be open through the summer...	1star
Today our group of 12 had a wonderful lunch at Antonios.   Everyone enjoyed their food and raved about the restaurant choice.   It wasn't easy to find a good restaurant in the area that had a menu to suit everyone, but Antionios did!     I highly recommend stopping here for a good meal, served quickly by friendly staff.   They even helped out splitting the bill which took a lot of stress of our group.    Thank you!	5star
Strongly recommended by our friends, and now want to recommend to all if you. Warm and nice service. The manager was especially careful for us. Spicy dumpling and chow fun recommended, but milktea maybe no.	5star
Cent'Anni is a solid 3. I've come here at least a dozen times and love sitting at the bar with a glass of wine. It's one of those places where the ambiance works for just about any occasion: date night, dinner with a friend, or even solo dining.  The bummer is that the food is pretty average. They boast a homemade pasta menu with slow-cooked sauces, but the flavors are always pretty flat. Of all the pasta dishes I've tried, which is quite a few, the only one that's actually pretty good is the orecchiette with pesto. I tried the tiramisu the other day which was also pretty unmemorable.  Despite the lackluster food, I continue coming back for the laid back/intimate bar vibe and vino.	3star
The food here was great! My friend ordered the Soy Fried Rice with Chicken Fillet, which he enjoyed though he did comment it was on the greasy side. I ordered the Chicken Curry Noodle Soup and Spicey Pork Soup Dumpling, and both of them tasted delicious! I favored the soup more then the dumpling, but I loved them both. The atmosphere was casual and the service was quick. I will definitely be returning here again.	4star
"The service was umm, very sporadic. Our server never came over to introduce himself, so we grabbed the host (who is also the manager) and he sent the gentleman over. We ordered one of the Special's of the Day, Risotto with salmon and Brussels sprouts as well as the Spaghetti with tomato/ basil and added chicken for $4. The food was good. The flavor was a bit lackluster, the risotto could have possibly used a pinch of salt. They offered a special on Yelp, for checking in you get a complimentary desert. We ordered the panna cotta, it was the best part of our dinner! Our ""server,"" whom never came over to check on us while we were eating, had no clue what the deal was. I attempted explaining and showing him the app. He nodded and delivered the check. With the desert on the bill. The manager had to remove it."	3star
"It's a surprising bad restaurant with a beautiful space, charming wait-staff, and a decent menu. We went last night because it's the perfect summer spot to sit outside. We stood around for 20 minutes while people ran by saying ""I'll be right with you"". We assumed something out of the ordinary was keeping the staff from seating us, but it turned out that the whole evening was like that. The food was mediocre to awful. I had dry overcooked chicken artfully arranged on a plate with such undercooked carrots that they might as well have been raw. My son's paella was mostly rice with a lobster claw sitting in the middle, but nothing to crack it. When after a half hour he finally flagged down a waiter he was told that they didn't have anything to break it with.  The dessert was a fried brioche with cinnamon sauce. Sounds pretty simple, right? It was just gross. It was expensive and disappointing, all of it. But the setting is lovely and the waitress was as nice as they come. The reason the place is so empty is that it's awful."	1star
WOW. this is what i love about yelp, sometimes the high ratings can be deceiving but being totally unfamiliar with anything above 180 street in Manhatten...I put my faith in Yelp, ALL good faith has been restored! with the high ratings Antonio's, i was intrigued.  not only had i just spent two hours wandering the bronx zoo in muggy/just rained summer weather but driving to and from the bronx was in adventure itself; my appetite was not to be toyed with.  walking up to the space, it almost looks closed but alas, find the italian men standing outside smoking cigars and enter through the bar and rejoice, your palate is about to be delighted. the service was quick, friendly, and professional.  seems a little fancier than surrounding places BUT seems like a place where the family comes together for a good home cooked meal when no one feels like cooking. the prices are affordable and the portions are plentiful. we started with the fried calamari which was crispy/just fried/and super fresh (waiter told us they get their seafood fresh everyday) and also got the veal meatballs which were super flavorful but still very light.   my dining partner and i split the eggplant parmesan which was perfectly fried but just enough chew and held up when being cut in half before being devoured, and as we had a choice between a red based ziti or white... go with the white.  the white ziti was light and tossed with a mixture of what seemed like white wine, butter, oil, and garlic but as simple as it was.... SO DELISH. this place is a gem. check in on yelp and get a glass of wine (with a nice pour at that)!  keep up the great work!	5star
"Not sure what happened today, but it was like the first day a restaurant opened.  I called to make a reservation for 2 at 530 pm. The recorded message said The Greek did not take reservations for under 4 people. So- we arrive at the restaurant, the first thing the hostess says  is ""Do you have a reservation?""  I explained.  Next the manager comes over and says ""Do  you have a reservation?"" I explained again.  The hostess seems confused about everything. Then, they offer to take our coats.  No system here.  Mine gets tossed over a sofa that was set us as a dining space for two people. My friends went behind some door. We never got numbers or anything. Lack of a system here also. We ask about a specific wine. The waitress is so kind to bring out a glass for us to taste.  My friend has a sip, then, I took a sip out of her glass.  We agreed that it was fine and that we wanted two glasses. The waitress proceeds to just pour into our tasting glass. I had to tell her that my friend needed a fresh glass. Then, the waitress comes back with one glass.  I had to tell her that we needed two glasses which is why we both tasted it. We are sitting at a table with decorative lights that keep going off and on.  Three times staff came over to adjust the flickering lights. I had to tell them to just turn the decorative lights off as the were annoying. Food was ok if you want to pay $19 for 6 stuffed grape leaves and about the same amount for some spreads.  Really pricey for what you get.  I agree with Nala P who commented on the $$  sign which means inexpensive.  None of these things is HUGE, but add them all up together and it is poor service and lack training."	2star

Great destination for all things Spain... The store isn't big but it's packed with lots of good things. As you enter, there's a giant wall of various canned goods from Spain. There's some good paprika and indigenous shelf stable ingredients.  On the right side there's a counter where you can get some of the popular selection of cheese and charcuterie. Towards the back of the store there's a self service refrigerator of beer, cider and other beverages. Quite honestly the food was just okay, I think you go here for the atmosphere and experience. All the food is served tapas style/small plates. They serve beer and wine, and if you go next door there's a full service wine shop. Great selection of Spanish wines. I found some great deals and great wines from this shop. They also can deliver the wine if you happen to be traveling. Salud!	4star
When I moved away from NYC for college, this was the place I missed the most. Seriously, it is so hard to find good Malaysian food anywhere.. this place hits the spot. They have a huge variety for their menu, so I enjoy going here when I can't decide what I'm in the mood for. I can pick a soup, noodles, rice, or delicious apps. I've never left disappointed.  I couldn't give them 5 stars because their service is pretty bad. I've eaten here enough to know it wasn't just a bad day, or bad luck. I just can't stop coming here because their food is amazing.  CASH ONLY, so make sure you go to the bank before arriving.	4star
THERE WAS A KNAT IN MY FOOD! [I have uploaded a picture] I ordered a take out order waited 45 min for a salad and mac & cheese. I get home and there is a knat in the container with my salad. I will never eat here again. Not to mention the service was horrible.	1star

Seems like their daily specials are what keeps the place going because the rest of the menu isn't all that great EXCEPT for their cheese curds which were little balls of loves. Tons of craft beers on tap and they are constantly being changed. Their truffle fries lacked the truffle taste and the Parmesan cheese IMO doesn't go that well with the huge fries, especially when the cheese isn't melted. What's the point of that? Place is conveniently located but don't really see myself going back.	3star
I've been hearing about this place for so long I finally made an effort to head over with family this Sunday afternoon. I was worried that we would have to wait on line for seating, especially since we were 7, but we came in and there was lots of seating and no lines. First of all, I had no idea this was a food truck joint. You go inside, choose your meal from the large menu posted on the wall, order your food then go outside and wait for your name & number to be called. All utensils, sauces and napkins are self serve. Pretty simple, and surprising, process but it was seamless and efficient. We sat down at one of the picnic communal tables and sipped on our drinks while we waited. My spiked lemonade was refreshing but not strong at all. 15-20 mins later our food was ready - food for 7 people might I add! We ordered the chicken diablo sandwich, the Cuban, chicken tenders, fries, Mexican corn, fish tacos, roasted pork plato & chicken quesadilla. The Cuban and the roasted pork plato were instantly the best dishes. Packed with flavor and nicely portioned. I only wish the Cuban had mustard instead of chipotle mayo. The fries were good too - nice and crispy. The chicken tenders were juicy all white meat. The corn was pretty good but had too much butter and cheese, for me at least. (Yep, I sampled everyone's dish! Lol) Everything else lacked flavor. I was mainly  disappointed with my fish tacos. So much in it and yet no flavor? How hard is it to season the fish? I was soo looking forward to it since I've been on the hunt for some delicious fish tacos.  All in all, the ambiance is awesome, the food is average but the prices are great. I fed 7 people with $106!	4star
This is my warning to anyone considering spending an hour in line for this pizza. It's below average for Brooklyn pizza and while very cute, charming and nostalgic, it's a complete waste of time and money. Good sauce, terrible crust, extremely slow service and extremely overpriced. I wish someone had told me, I wasted my whole lunch break and $20 for this utter disappointment	1star
I really wanted to love Gastroteca. I've walked past it so many times and always thought it looked charming. Finally my fiance and I tried it today for brunch. Sadly there were a lot of low points during our meal. First impression: it's loud. Plenty of people chatting and on top of that loud music. I'm not a fan of loud music in restaurants that makes it hard to talk. After sitting down we waited almost ten minutes for anyone to notice us. My fiance ordered a cocktail that was delivered in a dirty glass. We had to wait over 20 minutes to have it changed, and the cocktail fell very short of its description.  We barely saw our waiter and the other staff members seemed inexperienced. When my fiance's cocktail was changed a different waiter brought him a replacement. Since he whisked away the old one so fast we didn't get a chance to tell him what we ordered. When he came back with another cocktail we asked him if it was a WINter (the cocktail we originally ordered). He just shrugged. How do you now know what drink you brought us? We never saw a waiter other than to deliver food or to pick up empty glasses. No one came by to see how we were doing. Clearly, the waitstaff isn't used to circulating the room. The food itself was fine, but not spectacular. My mushroom omelet was a fine omelet but the fries on the side were greasy and limp. My fiance's brunch lasagna had underdone pasta and was rather dry (not surprising as there's no real sauce to speak of) and small. It needed something else, even something as simple as a side salad. The zeppoles were very tasty and quite dense/rich, probably the best part of our meal.  All in all, I don't need to go back to Gastroteca. I can make myself an omelet (and frankly, a better french fry) and my home has a calmer atmosphere. I think if the staff were to get a better handle on service this place could be much better.	2star
I dont know what all the hype is about.  I guess i just prefer my seafood at least warm not cold and with buter not mayo and more seasoning.  I wouldn't mind the mayo if it was seasoned.  The crab tasted the best out of all but still underwhelming.  Sorry Joes, I gave you a second chance	2star
This place could have been the whole package: gorgeous venue, excellent location, delicious food and drinks... But the service was really so disappointing that I had to knock off a whole star for this review. Nevertheless, this place is still worth a trek for the food alone. We came here for a birthday dinner with a table of 9. Yes, that made bill splitting a bit of a nightmare, but we were all happy to tip graciously and we were respectful of the waitstaff. The waitstaff, however, was not happy with that and a friend noticed visible hostility when she asked that our bills be split. We all ordered drinks and a few appetizers. Granted, it was a Saturday night and the place was packed, but the first drink order took an inordinately long amount of time. The second drink order we had to place TWICE mid-meal ended up coming to us all the way at the end with dessert. Then, when I asked for a birthday dessert to be brought out with a candle, it took about 3 different tries to make it clear who the birthday girl was. I didn't think I was being unclear but apparently so. Now that the bad is out of the way, on to the good: MY GOD, THAT FOOD IS DELICIOUS. We ordered the baked bread, which was warm and came with the softest butter I have ever had in my life. Excellent. Then my friend and I shared the tuna tartare - the avocado mousse was a perfect bed for the tuna tartare and the ginger and soy vinaigrette was impeccably paired. Then, we shared the chicken for two - tender, tender chicken plated with the crispiest potato wedges and a delicious dill creme fraiche. That dish came with the butteriest and most decadently rich pot pies I've had in a long while. We were stuffed to the gills. We also ordered the Turkish Rose and what a combination. Gin, Vermouth, black cherry, Bergamot is a heady mix, and boy, was it good. I could have done with the huge amount of crushed ice, but it was refreshing on a humid summer night. Aside from the blips from the service, overall I had a great time here and would highly recommend this place, maybe for brunch or on a weeknight when it's not as packed.	4star
Here was crowded even in rainy evening, but their food was not to my taste though they have a so good reputation. Next time I'd like to have rice or pita.	3star
3 stars for now, since I didn't order an entree. Service was okay. Wait time was underestimated. I ordered the Daisy Chain Cocktail, side of Collard Greens and Donut Sandwich of the day. Cocktail was refreshing and unique flavor: rum, St. Germaine, yellow chartreuse, raspberry and lime juice Collard Greens included cranberries. I was expecting a ham hock, guess it's vegetarian :-(.  Surprisingly, it's a good pair:  salty and sweet. Donut special was ordinary:  vanilla donut, vanilla ice cream and white chocolate glaze. The white chocolate glaze was the best thing on the plate = tasted like and had consistency mirroring sweetened condensed milk. I should return to eat its famous chicken n waffles.	3star
"Okay okay it's one of the first nice days of spring.. but do I still need to wait an hour of basic brunch food? Every. One. Was complaining only I took it a step further by asking to speak to the manager. All he wanted to do was lay on excuses - does ""the customer is always right"" no longer apply anymore?  Anyway in the end they comped 1 drink but I was at brunch with someone else. In my opinion it was rude that they only took off one. Guess my friend waiting doesn't matter? Food was alright they just have so much hype right now and it doesn't seem like they can live up to it."	1star
This place is garbage. The chicken in the salad was not good. We asked if we could swap out the bottomless drinks and were misled by our server Chelsea into thinking we wouldn't be charged separately. On top of that, I'm a lightweight and didn't feel even a little buzzed after 5 drinks. It's way too expensive for the area and the food isn't good enough to make up for that. Fuck this place.	1star
"The experience started out quite well but deteriorated from there.  We ordered three shareables: shrimp, roasted eggplant and cauliflower.  The shrimp and eggplant were amazing.  But 20 minutes after those plates were removed from our table, we still didn't have our cauliflower.  We were assured three times by our server that it was ""coming out.""  When it finally did, the food was cold and the cheese wasn't even melted. It's as if the plate sat out the entire time we waited for it.  We sent it back, asked for the check and left.  Our server was very nice, but this was rather unfortunate."	2star
As soon as I walked in, I knew we would have a great time! It's the perfect place to host Happy Hour with your coworkers. We went here last week and it was packed! Great, relaxing atmosphere. Long bar and dim lighting.  You can come in to drink, you can come in to eat a meal. The atmosphere is relaxed and engaging. The beers are reasonably priced and there's a great selection of beers on tap.	4star
Came in here for an early dinner with three friends on a Sunday. I ordered the crespelle with mushrooms and was expecting way more of a mushroom flavor. The entire dish was pretty bland and watery, but everyone else seemed to enjoy their meal! I could tell the pasta was really fresh so points for that!	3star
The staff was so nice but I'm not sure why this place is so popular. I went with two other people, we all got different things and we all did not like them at all.	1star
Echoing what other reviewers have said - this place is really good and REALLY reasonably priced and also really fills up. Plan on leaving your number with the host and then barhopping around 9th til they call you. What we tried (+in order of how much we liked): CRISPY CHICKEN - holy crap, so much chicken (for like $12?!)! Tastes pretty good too. ANGRY SWEET POTATO - basically fries. Wish there was more of the sauce. Wish there was more of this dish in my daily life. STEAK - melt in yo mouth. Grits are a bit on the heavy side tho. TUNA TARTARE - delicious and beautifully plated. KOREAN PANCAKE - without the sauce it would have been too fishy, and while it's tasty I probably wouldn't order this one again.  Service is polished and attentive. Vibe is awesome. Bae asked right after dinner if we could go back the next day for brunch, so a return visit must happen soon :)	4star
This Chelsea spot was over-hyped. We went for brunch. I got the huevos rancheros and donut. IT was good, the cocktails were better than the food. I don't know if I have anything else memorable to say about this restaurant. Everything was cooked well, the donut was served warm. Wait staff was attentive. Long wait times during brunch. I am trying to remember what else - and I simply cannot.	3star
I was told by the manager on 10/20 that I could not order my food because they were closed. Though I was sitting inside on the bench (waiting for the long line to go down), the manager stated that he was in the restaurant for 20mins, and did not see me (basically saying I was lying about being in the restaurant). After he argued with me for about 5 mins, I left. I will never attempt to eat at that Shake Shack ever again.	1star
I recommend the gnocchi, pasta dishes and the mussels, they are awesome and delightful options. Service is fine but not so great.	3star
Solid soup dumplings in a more cafeteria-style setting. Is it the best soup dumpling I've ever had? No. But it isn't far from it and it's definitely convenient and QUICK! It is a satisfying, good meal when I'm craving Shanghainese food and don't feel like trekking out to Chinatown (not that it's far but a girl's gonna be lazy sometimes). Close to Metrotech so it's close to my boyfriend's grad school classes, too. We've gotten the soup dumplings (pork and crab, all the way) a number of times and they're always good. Not greasy! I got the fried sticky rice last time cus I was starving and wanted something to eat with the dumplings without ordering another full-on dish. It was good and I really liked the texture. It's sticky rice, pressed into rectangular blocks and lightly fried, with a sauce on top that's like a not-spicy version of spicy mayo... maybe a play on Thousand Island dressing even. Weirdly, it works and I enjoyed it. We've also had a couple of the soups and those were great too. I like the decor and layout too. Def recommend!	4star
Boo Boo and I came here for a quick lunch. The space is very small but the turnover of customer is fast. We ate at the communal table.  I ordered the spicy pork and Boo Boo got the special pork (only 10 bowls served/day). Her ramen tasted better but almost all ramen taste the same to me. We also shared gyoza.  Decent spot for a fast lunch.	4star
I've been meaning to pop in here for awhile now. Once I came at around 9:30 pm on a Saturday night mistakenly and was met with a fully packed bar and seating area. The space was so tight that we left immediately upon entering. Lesson learned: do not come here at such times. Instead, I revisited with a friend at around 5pm on a weekday. Much more casual and much less claustrophobic. The vibe here is interesting at that time though. The restaurant-y part is supposed to be more Asian, but they were bangin out Hispanic music? Interesting. But the happy hour prices here are great. Now, $6 lychee martinis and whatever else was on the happy hour menu.  The lychee martini was pretty forgettable. Perhaps, it tastes better at night with a different bartender. But I didn't think any of the other cocktails were memorable either. However, their happy hour is a high contender for me returning and hoping to stumble upon better drinks. Service was pretty good, but my friend likes to be spontaneous and the waiter could not offer a spontaneous drink selection for the life of her.	3star
Nice people but the 4.5 rating is inaccurate. I actually got excited seeing a Mexican food spot with 4.5 but the food was dissapointing. I might be back for a drink but I'll cook my own Mexican food. Even the guacamole was old, tired, brown. Less than mediocre.	2star
Absolutely loved our visit here! We made a reservation ahead of time for an early 11:30 brunch and were seated immediately even though we arrived early. They gave us a corner booth and our server was right there with water and fresh bread (the bread was so good!).  All of the entrees we had were great and came out in about 15-20 minutes which was perfect and gave us time to enjoy the bread and get started on cocktails.  Our server was very attentive without being overbearing and even split the check for us.	5star
LEGIT! Amazing beef hand pulled noodle soup. Price and taste can't be beat. However, you know it's turned hipster when you're the only Asian customer in the joint.... get ready for price hikes!	5star
The four stars at this place have to be a classic tourist-area-Yelp-markup because we ordered 3 of the top items (Spaghetti, mac and cheese balls, Nutella bread pudding) and they were all flavorless and terrible.	1star
Found this place walking around on highline. Got there about 930 just before the brunch crowd filled the place up. Creative breakfast choices, great Bloody Mary's, and amazing beignets. Our server Stephanie could not have been nicer. Will definitely go back.	4star
Less than mediocre. Staff member was rude. Food was not good. You can find better options in the neighborhood for $8 than plate full of dry rice and sadly chopped lettuce.	2star
I love tacos, guac and all the fixings.. Anywhere .but I'm really dissapointed in the corner.  4$ for a tiny, one tortilla taco with dry meat?  What happened to Mexican being affordable?  12$ for guac and chips??  I love tacos but I can't afford this place... Especially when for 10$ chipotle fills me up.  Lower your prices!!!	1star
Unfortunately, the menu pricing on yelp is incorrect. $11 for two minuscule steak tacos is highway robbery. The flavor was good but not even close to worth it. You can get similar tacos for much cheaper a few blocks away.	2star
Trendy new spot, accommodated our party of 4 without reservation. Food was good, ambience great, service needs room for improvement. We waited 15-minutes before our waitress came over to introduce herself.  While our food came in a reasonable amount of time we didn't see our waitress until we got the check.  Even thou my first experience wasn't great I'm willing to give it another try.	4star
This review is for brunch. The place is seriously awesome - super breezy and lets in tons of sunshine and is absolutely the perfect place to be on a nice summer day. Truly offers unparalleled ambiance that jives nicely with the name of the establishment. The food however, both by selection and quality, is very average, especially given the price (on second thought I could be paying for ambiance). The brunch menu options are limited since the restaurant only has a grill, versus pans, rendering classic brunch options (e.g. poached eggs, eggs benedict) unavailable. Nice service and awesome all round, besides the food, which again is not bad but not superb.	3star
This is great place for tapes and also bigger food plates. We came around 5:00 and were seated right away. Their happy hour menu goes till 6:00PM. Everything was delicious just one suggestion would be to put more rub on the chicken before deep drying. The meat was a little bland but the sweet and sour sauce mad up for it.	4star
Had very high hopes for the ramen here as I've heard nothing but great things- one being that they've been rated Michelin stars. Unfortunately my experience wasn't as anticipated as the broth was very salty.  Service was good. My family and I got sat faster than expected and their snacks were tasty. The daikon & jalapeños were my favorite.	2star
The Smith has been buried in my bookmarks for quite some time but I was conveniently in the area (at around 11, so most of the smaller restaurants had already closed) with my boyfriend last week so we decided to check it out. A little after 11PM on a Friday night, the restaurant was a bit busy but not to the point where it was chaotic. We were seated promptly and, because we were both starving, got straight to ordering. I ordered the chicken pot pie and my boyfriend ordered the burger royale. Their drink menu is on the unique side, but with neither my boyfriend nor I being in much of a mood to drink, we shared a bottle of Wölffer dry rosé cider. All were delicious and to top it all off, awesome customer service! My boyfriend and I continued talking even long after we devoured our food, and though 1AM (closing time) was nearing, not a single worker made us feel rushed! I would love to come back to try their brunch menu, which is what originally grabbed my attention and got me to bookmark the restaurant in the first place.	4star
Just quite not my style of pizza. The crust was rock hard and the oil was scorching hot. Everything was made on the spot and it had fresh basil, it didn't meet the expectation of my taste buds. Everything is old school and it looks like they haven't changed their approach.	2star
This place has changed over the years. Unfortunately for the worst. Like the latest reviewer before me that has said this bar abuses its power because the location had been used in a few movie scenes(mind you only really short ones) Neirs has really gotten snobby. I've even promised myself to not come back to my own neighborhood bar. 1. 2 drink minimum. That's right, its not a fancy place, neirs is really small and not the prettiest bar I've been too and its not really in a fancy neighborhood but they  added a new 2 drink minimum rule if their customers are not ordering food. 2. Food sucks. They are transitioning to a restaurant bar by enforcing a 'order food or 2 drink minimum' rule. They keep switching up chefs mainly because of pay issues and neither of them look happy to cook at neirs. Ive had the food a few times, burgers wings onion rings etc. But its usually inconsistent. Last time I had burgers it was bland, no seasoning, and over priced. I guess it depends on the chefs mood whether or not you're going to get good food. 3. Overpriced food. Yeah I think its time for that single dollar bill sign on this yelp page to turn into two. if u are willing to spend that amount of money, there are wayyy better bar/lounges in Manhattan for the price bro. 4. Weird vibes. Mix of snobbyness and redneckness.. My friend went to the jukebox the other day and played a song that he wanted to hear. It was a modern catchy techno-ish song. Then one of the employees went to the jukebox as soon as the song started and changed it to something more slow and restaurant friendly even though my friend had payed for the song. They just give weird vibes to anyone different or isn't going to spend a load of money for their food.  Neirs used to be a nice old-time neighborhood spot where I can sit, relax and comfortably drink a beer. Now it feels like im intruding whenever I walk in there.	1star
Clearly a lot of the reviews are written by their friends. I respect farm to table but please learn how to cook. Biscuits and gravy for brunch was nothing more than sloppy joe on a plate with a burnt biscuit. Ugh, it was presented like dog food. Not coming here again. I'll wait for the next restaurant to replace it. Incredibly disappointing and disgusting. Not worth your time and $$$. The interior designer did a nice job though.	1star
Live to live this place  The happy hours from 5-7 are amazing and makes me feel happy just by thinking about it with 12 dollar wine flights of wine with any mix you want from the menu  The escargot also has a happy hour price and it is really good that you scape every last bit of sauce with pieces of baguette bread on the table with you!!! So good!! :D	5star
I arrived to New York and ended up in Midtown and when I pulled up my phone the only thing that I bookmarked that I wanted to eat was Carmine's. An old Italian coworker told me that if you ever go to New York go to Carmine's because the meatballs are big and amazing. That's being a fan of Italian food here in the states I needed to check it out. As soon as I arrived it took about 10 minutes to get a table and it was quick and easy even though it was in Times Square. I found out that even though the prices are around 20 or $30 for plates deer huge they can feed around two to three people and thank God I asked because I was about to order two to three things that could have been impossible to finish. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs as around $30 or so and if fed three people in the table it was around maybe 6 or so meatballs I think and over. This place filled me up with great delicious food and the bread at the beginning of the meal also requested some delicious wine to pair with the food and it was the perfect environment in New York City. Had a little bit of leftover unfortunately my stomach couldn't take it but all you need to do is wrap it up and donated to a person around the corner that will highly appreciate it.	3star
There happy hour is a complete scam...they tell everyone it's  (whatever amount of time is needed for happy hour to end) we were standing inside watching 4 tables empty by the front.  When I asked a about the empty tables they said that they texted the people for the tables (45 min the tables were empty) at 7:01 pm on the dot all of the sudden all of the hosts got busy telling us tables are ready.  I've eaten here before and I'd recommend mermaid oyster bar downtown over this 10 out of 10 times.  Food is exactly the same	1star
We came in for a quick coffee break and ended up with the worst latte possible. The croissant bread pudding didn't save the day either... Wouldn't dream to come back	1star
Finally made it here! This place has been sitting in my bookmarks for a long while but I can cross it off my checklist now. The first time I came here, the restaurant had just gotten full so we we went somewhere else after being quoted an hour wait. Make sure you get here around opening time to be seated right away! Fortunately the second time I got to the restaurant with my friends before opening time so we were able to get a table.  The waitress recommended ordering 2 dishes per person so we ordered a total of 7 to share among the four of us (all girls). Some standouts were the popcorn chicken, soft shell crab and eel taco. Service was quick and attentive and our waitress did an excellent job explaining the menu and providing input on whether we had ordered too much food.  Overall, we all enjoyed our time here. The food and service were both on par and so were the prices. If it weren't located so far East, I would definitely come here more often!	4star
One of the best dinners I have had in a long time! Very satisfying +Amazing food + great ambiance.   We ordered 2 small plates(brown bag beans, Veggies with ricotta) + 2 large plates(chicken, lamb) + tahini and bread Perfect for two people. Plotting when I can go back next!	5star
I love the fish tank behind the bar! It's super divey spot for local south slopers, but we love sea witch. Little booth up front that serves food, and I haven't had the burger, but hear it's a must try if you're at the witch.	4star
I get breakfast from here everyday and it never disappoints. Amazing food, quality and quantity wise.  The eggs Benedict and avocado toast are my fave	5star
We exited this famed establishment wondering what happened to the service?  Now, to be fair, we have had wonderful meals there.  Perhaps it was just a fluke, but here is the story.   Just wanted an early dinner, so decided to try the bar area.  We were promptly seated and that is when things just didn't seem right.  Our server arrived promptly to provide menus and specials (the 'burger'),  and then disappeared for quite some time.  So, we sat there for about 20 minutes, until we asked one of the hosts to send over our server, who quickly appeared.  He went right to the meal order, but alas, we requested drinks first.  We did order the burger special, though.  Were we not supposed to order the burger, because it took about another 15 minutes for the drinks to arrive.  And what?  The food came on its heals.  Now I will say, that we couldn't help but notice most of the other servers, who were quite attentive to their tables, even stopping and chatting. So, we ate our meal, was presented with a dessert menu (passed), paid the bill and left.  Pretty disappointing, all in all.	2star
Decor is on point at this Thai restaurant, and not to forget so is the food! We had ordered the sugar cane skewer, pad thai, pho, eggplant, and the tom yum soup. My favorite was the pad thai! It had enough sweetness to it, which blended with the entire flavor very well. The tom yum was really good as well as the rest of the dishes. Overall, I would come back again!	4star
went for dinner on a Wednesday night and was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience. the inside is rustic yet modern and very cozy...especially with the chilliness outside. the food was awesome...shrimp tacos were super tasty as well as the muscles in a delicious broth. my only complaint is that the bartender acted like he knew everything there is to know about beer (not uncommon in this neighborhood) and actually gave us the wrong information!  oh man...bartenders need to stop trying to impress beer drinkers especially when their patrons tend to know more than they do!  can i just get served a beer without a history lesson on hops attached to it?       i will return.	4star
"So it's been about a year since I moved to the neighborhood and I was excited to get a chance to go back to Bushwick Living room with my boyfriend. We ordered The Original Burger cooked medium-rare, fried panko breaded chicken tenders with thai spice and a bloody mary, which I remembered being delicious and amazing. But unfortunately it was mostly vodka and horseradish. Now I love spicy drinks and I love Bloody Mary's that are a little bit more intense but this drink not only cleared my sinuses, but made my eyes water, it was completely unbearable. Then we got our food. The chicken tenders were a gorgeous deep gold color but had no flavor what so ever,  and burger looked great, but it deceivingly juicy as it was completely brown in the middle, like medium almost medium well,  and although the fries were a tad soggy, they were still tasty... When I finally got the waiters attention and I told him why I didn't like the drink he told the bartender's and one guy stared at me and began talking about... Whatever. The waiter came back and I ordered the El Burro Loco, a spicy pomegranate habanero syrup drink with ginger beer and lime, it sounded amazing, the bartender came over apologized, very condescendingly, and began to tell me that if I didn't like the spice of the horseradish in the Bloody Mary I would definitely not like this drink, ""it's far too spicy for me""... To be honest spicy isn't the problem, horseradish is a pungent - fiery flavor that 0primarily burns the sinuses unlike a habanero that is spicy on the tongue, which i enjoy. The bartender and waiter had apologized and comped the drink under the guise of saying it was a ""spill"" which really pissed me off. As someone who has worked in the restaurant industry for 10 years I was upset to see the wrong reason stated on my receipt... All in all, the service was friendly but this place just left me feeling unsatisfied... I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and I see no reason to go back."	1star
This is a fabulous location..... But unfortunately the service is horrible... I have been waiting for the last 30 mins for server to take my dinner order . If you come it's for the drinks and atmosphere and that's it...... Service is horrible	1star
Solid food at great prices!! The XLB is perfect; the meat to soup ratio is spot on, and the dumpling skin is just the right thickness. An order comes with 6 and costs $5.95 (+$1 for crab+pork filling). The cold appetizers were delicious (try the fried bean gluten; trust me, it tastes way better than it sounds!) The noodles are average and not much better than ones you would get from a fast food joint. Skip this, and go for the items with the bizarre names. They also have a great breakfast menu, which we were allowed to order from at dinner time. The scallion pancake with sliced beef is the best I've ever had! A super crispy and flaky pancake with juicy, tender meat in the center. A little oily though, but that's prob why it tasted so damn good. -1 star for being cash only and for having flimsy, dirty laminated menus that have seen better days.	4star
Was looking for dumplings and found this on yelp. What I ordered: Pork Dumplings ($4) Taste: Taste was okay, it was like potstickers to me. 5 dumplings for $4 wasn't bad though!	3star
The waiter was nice, it was crowded but food came fast. Everyone else seemed to love their food and it all tasted good, but the brunch bowl I got tasted like plastic. I'd order something else next time but I'll probably come back	4star
Very average food, it feels like apple bees including the service. Prices are aggregated for the quality , It felt like one of those places trying to cash out mass produced food	1star
"Just way too overpriced for mediocre ""Viet"" food.  Did not like this place too much and price was a BIG factor.  Whoever heard of $22 for Bo Luc Lac???  That's absurd!  We're big Viet cuisine lovers and this place just kept disappointing from the overly milky coffee to the dry Canh ga chieng (tamarind chicken wings) and tiny (Crab and glass noodle stir-fried) Mien cua.  The food suited West Village more so than Williamsburg where you can get much better viet cuisine all around."	1star
Loved the texture of their pasta! Perfect for a quick lunch, very tasty and affordable.	5star
Wow. This. One of my favorite restaurants in New York hands down! Come here if you want to eat amazing South East Asian food with an emphasis on pig.  I've been here a couple of times and each time I order the sisig which is little diced cubes of pork served piping hot on a sizzling hot plate. The dish is topped with a delicious gooey egg. You will not regret ordering this dish. (Trust me. Do it!) Otherwise, would also recommend the pork belly adobo (the skin is so nice and crispy), pork jowl, skate wing(wing of a sting ray, but don't let that scare you it just tasted like tender fish), seafood soup (sour and savory) and mantou buns/coconut rice sides. But really I feel like you cannot go wrong with any of their menu items. Make a reservation if you can on Fridays and weekends as it can get kind of crowded. Otherwise, get ready to eat eat and eat!!	5star
"I was excited for a nice dinner out... I ordered a NY Strip medium rare which came with risotto, they served me a hard steak which was weird because it was red in the middle whilst still being hard, gross. I actually hit it with my knife and it made the sound of a wood block! It was served on a bed of uncooked risotto with the unabsorbed water included! ha! What a joke. I sent it back and from this point on we didn't get cordial service. We had a couple of appetizers that were pretty good... french fries & burrata cheese. Also good was the bread they served in a plant pot. Delicious. Seems like maybe the ""Chef"" either doesn't know how to cook or he doesn't give a sh**. The server could have been nicer and offered a complimentary drink or something but didn't. And when we left no one said goodbye even as they were saying goodbye to other guests...  don't go here.  Since I wrote this I was sent a message from the GM Todd McKinney calling me an idiot! What kind of a GM does that!"	1star
One of my favorite restaurant that I always have to stop by when I am in NYC.. the plantains da bomb...	5star
Thought this place would live up to the four star rating but it was just ok. Pancetta and shrimp in my pasta dish were under cooked and kale salad was too sweet.	2star
"My husband and I sat down at 9:00 with reservations. Now it's 10:05. All we had so far was half dozen oysters (3 each). We are STARVING! Where's our food??? There's only one waitress for the entire restaurant.  Never coming back. Bye. Waitress just came and said ""Guys, this wine... Is on us..."". Whatever. Still never coming back."	1star
Why is the delivery guy came to my desk in my office and asking for more tips!???? 10% is not enough??  Could your restaurant or the delivery company have a little courtesy to pay a minimum wage so we don't deal with their protest from them for you????  So I paid $14 dollar for a lunch meal and bunch of attitude!	1star
"I'm actually writing this hoping I can get some answers from management! This review is for takeout only: -The food takes an hour and 45 minutes to be delivered even on off-peak hours, so if that's an issue for you find somewhere else- -Food is great-  HOWEVER (big however) frequent mistakes are made-almost every order-especially with the vegan food. For example getting a regular order of something instead of the vegan option you ordered---with crema and that little white crumbled cheese all over it. They'll admit their mistake and send another one when asked but if you aren't careful/not paying attention you could be very sick if you have dietary restrictions such as dairy allergy/intolerance. Same thing with ""vegan"" kids burrito comes with what looks like white real cheese melted on it, when cheese is not listed on the menu as one of the ingredients, and none of the vegan food has vegan cheese listed as an ingredient. Suspicious right? It'd be great if simply this were vegan cheese and it is somehow not listed on the menu as an ingredient in this item. After this happened twice I called the restaurant and the person who picked up said everything on the burrito was vegan. I hope this is true (but kinda doubt it) otherwise someone's kid with a dairy allergy could be very sick one day. (Management-I have cell phone images of this I would really appreciate your taking a look to confirm/deny what type of cheese this is).  Other annoyances are receiving brown rice on a burrito when you ordered white rice, but at least no one is (potentially) going to be ill. This also happened twice but I've never called to complain about this one because the kids burrito is only a few dollars and not worth asking them to send another one but is annoying if your kid doesn't eat brown rice.  Management, it is one thing to send brown rice instead of white but if you are going to offer vegan options, I believe it's your honest responsibility to make sure orders are correct! People choose vegan for a variety of reasons such as food allergies to dairy, eggs, etc.  I obviously am not ordering from here anymore but thought my review would help other people get better service in the future!"	2star
"While I commend people for trying to strip away the pretension that can affect eating in this town, Anable Basin goes to far in avoiding pretension. It also avoids any kind of quality.  The view is, admittedly, fantastic. The drink selection isn't great. The beer bottles looked pretty standard, although I did spot Brooklyn on tap. When I asked what the wines were, the guy at the counter had to look at the bottles to figure out what kind they were (and he wasn't actually able to tell). The food was really the lowpoint. As people have pointed out, there's a great grill out front which adds to the atmosphere. For $10 each my wife and I ordered a bratwurst and a burger. The brat was mostly warm, unflavorful, surrounded by out-of-the-bag room temperature pita bread, and some yellow mustard. The burger was described by my wife as ""Costco quality"" with no seasoning and no flavor to speak of. For $10, I expect something that I couldn't surpass with 10 minutes and some salt and pepper.  So perhaps this should just be thought of as a chill drink spot. The drink prices are reasonable enough. I just couldn't stand the nonstop techno/house music. So, unless you like nonstop beats as the soundtrack to a lovely summer's evening outside, it probably not for you. And here's the thing about that amazing view. Gantry Plaza Park is just a few blocks away. It's wonderfully designed with hammocks, lounging chairs, lawns galore, and tons of great ways to enjoy that same amazing view for free. So I guess that's why I'm not feeling it. If I'm gonna go enjoy an afternoon on the water with a view, I don't need to spend $20 on poor food to do it. (Note: I went on a Saturday evening around 8, so perhaps at other times the music situation is different)"	1star
One thing to be aware of is that Grimaldi's is Cash only. Also, be prepared to wait in a line, because yes, the pizza is THAT Good! We stood outside in line for about 30-45minutes (with a party of five people). I went to another Pizza place in New York, and it didn't even begin to compare to Grimaldi's. We got a small pizza, and for travelers with no fridge/microwave in their hotel room, that's what I would recommend. In fact, we still had two pieces leftover which we ate later for a snack. I got the White Pizza with add-ons of Ricotta, Sweet peppers, and Meatballs. It was delicious!  When I come back to NY, I will definitely be coming back to Grimaldi's!!	5star
Glasserie is DEAD to me. Their brunch is delicious but it makes ZERO sense that you can't share the mezze. They say it's like paying the price of a single admission to an all you can eat buffet, but that's hardly what it's like, especially when it's just you and another person. Please cease offering refills (that is NOT the function of this style of eating and it's a sick joke that they pretend otherwise) and let us share. Used to love Glasserie for brunch but like so many other restaurants in the neighborhood it now belongs only to the people who don't need to worry about value when they go out to eat.	2star
Meh.  Their menu is tricky, you see. There are things on there that don't have prices. So be careful what you order. Gnocchi for $20+?! It was just a small plate... and nothing special. We shared a bunch of apps. Polenta was a good one. But everything else seems to be lackluster. I liked my dish but felt ripped off at the end. Dessert was amazing though. I love a tiramisu with moscato any time.  Also, rude service and cash only.  FYI: if you get here earlier than your party, they'll send you to the bar next door where nobody is there to serve you until 20 minutes later, by which your party will probably have arrived.  CHECK THE BILL TO SEE IF THEY DOUBLE CHARGE YOU.	2star
One word: AMAZING!!! I tried Pies-n-Thighs at the suggestion of a colleague and it did not disappoint.   At first glance, this restaurant seems very small.  But there is additional seating in the back.  My daughter and I sat in the back near the barn doors.  We both ordered the Mac and Cheese and Collard Greens.  She got the fried chicken and I, the fried catfish.  Both sides were delicious, as was the meat.  My daughter loved the hot sauce (and she doesn't like hot sauce).  It definitely added a wonderful kick of flavor. Can't wait to go back.	5star
YUM!! This place is a legit hole in the wall, which to me makes it better. The dumplings are soooo yummy, fresh, and CHEAP.  8 plump dumplings for $3.  We got both the fried and boiled and both were relish.  Covered them in the dumpling sauce and chili oil.  I wanted to put the chili oil in my purse.  Also got the beef brisket noodle soup, which was tasty as well.  The waitresses barely speak English, are kind of rude and table situation is tight, but kind of endearing.  Definitely, just squeeze in there is a chair.  I LOVE IT!!	5star
Although the food came on time and warm, the jerk chicken wings STILL HAD FEATHERS ON THEM. **BARF** Absolutely disgusting, and I immediately lost my appetite and could not make myself eat any of the rest of the food I ordered.	1star
I love these tacos and I was ecstatic that they opened this one right near my office! I went to this location for the first time on a Friday, 10 min before 1pm, but the line was ridiculously long, snaked around, with line dividers and everything. I didn't feel like waiting, so I went back to the office and had a snack. I came back out 10 min before 3pm and there wasn't a single person in line! I was so happy! I ordered my tacos (one asada, one adobado, both with everything) and was on my way. Because of the numerous rave reviews, I think it goes without saying, these tacos are amazing! The adobado is my favorite, but the asada is also amazingly good and comes with guac - yum!	5star
I don't get why this place is popular. The hand pull noodles are too soft with no texture, the dumpling skin is too thick, the hot sauce is not spicy at all, the fried noodle has no flavor but soy sauce. The sauce containers are nasty, I was surprised that this is an A restaurant. However, the employees are nicer than what you would find at other Chinese restaurants who give attitude when you ask for things.	2star
My wife and I came here with some friends and were instantly impressed with the cool ambiance and friendly staff. They have happy hour drink and oyster specials in the bar area so my wife and I had a unique cocktail and a half dozen oysters.  They were small but fresh and delicious. Up in the upper level dining area We shared the lamb loin which was served with roasted eggplant.  It was perfectly cooked but the flavor was a little underwhelming.  There was some sort of crust that was hard to identify but reminded me of hemp hearts.  One of My friends had the duck which was superb.  The other friend had the ny strip which was also very tasty.  Wine selection was great - highly recommend the Justin Cabernet! Only reason for one star off is the price-which is kind of unavailable in NYC...  And the slightly less than perfect lamb.	4star
"Overhyped*.  The food is tasty, but the menu is less compelling & more expensive than it was when I first fell in love with the 'hood.  Service has gone downhill. I get that ""atmosphere"" is part of the appeal, but they've taken it too far over the last year.  It converts to a high-octane club earlier in the evening (and on more days of the week) than before, ruining it for locals who just want a nice meal.  The waitstaff also seem to have shifted focus, and not in a good way: while their uniform styling has gotten more & more outlandish (insert joke about ""pieces of flair""), their knowledge of & care for the actual product has gone way down.  Twice now I've had guys who seemed to have been pressed into service for the weekend rush w/o any training about what's on the menu. As for said menu, the overall ""upscale soul"" concept is intact, but some old favorites have disappeared without adequate replacement.  In particular, I have to call out the lack of carb-y options on the brunch menu.  I'm an eggs-for-breakfast type myself, but for most of my dining companions, it simply doesn't count as brunch until the pancakes/muffins/etc have arrived and been drenched in some kind of syrup.  To this end, Red Rooster used to serve a killer french toast dish (topped with chocolate ""gravy""), among others...where have all those options gone?  The closest equivalent is the Yardbird & waffles, but even that trends toward the savory -- in a good way, IMO, but not one that will satisfy a sweet tooth. Bottom line: they do not deserve the crowds clogging up our sidewalk nor the queue of double-parked cabs blocking our street.  For a better execution of the same upscale fusion vibe, please patronize The Cecil instead.  For equally good South-inspired food w/o the pretentious vibe & pricing, try Boulevard Bistro.  For authenticity (and way less $$), prefer Sylvia's or Jacob's or anywhere else really.  This place has always flirted with bougie bullshit, but now it's gone off the rails. *2.75 stars, rounded down due to effusive grade inflation from tourists"	2star
We had the most delicious brunch!   Their French toast, with bananas, soooo yummy along with their frittata's , delicious....   The service was great... There's outdoor or indoor dining...  Awesome place...Will definitely be back!	5star
I do not know how this place has so many 4 and 5 star reviews.  I found it mediocre at best.  The upstairs is freezing, if you eat here in the winter, eat downstairs.  Even our waitress agreed, she said it is always freezing upstairs, next time to ask to eat downstairs. Everyone was eating in their coats.  The food is not bad but I would stay away from any seafood and stick to regular pasta dishes.  It is not inexpensive though for what it is. It is a glorified pizza and pasta place.  Our waitress brought us the wrong wine, it was not on ice and neither or us was offered to try a sip first (and it was a cork bottle not a twist).  I would not eat here again.  There are so many better places to eat on the UES, I would skip this.	2star
This place has average and forgettable seafood and is so loud that, at a booth nestled in the corner of the restaurant, you'll be screaming to hear each other.  Just FYI, they recycle the same sauce used for the calimari on the crispy red snapper (a honey glaze that tastes vaguely of general tso's chicken from a cheap Chinese takeout place). Pretty tiring if you order both in the same meal (also, not super creative).  The calimari is re-fried. The shrimp appetizer isn't bad and is a bit fishy. The buffalo chicken lollipops were tasty (easily the best thing we ate that night, which is odd, given this is a fishbar).  Either New Yorkers have forgotten what good, fresh seafood tastes like, or half of these reviews are written by people who are crazy. Chelsea Market has better seafood and better clam chowder by a wide margin. Yikes. Seriously, how is this place still open? Decor's not bad, and feels like a yacht. Is that it?	2star
I just ordered the first item on the brunch menu, the chechebsa. I would describe it as inedible. Although I enjoy the spices, the texture is terrible, burnt, the only thing that could possibly make it better is if it was served with more cashew yogurt to mask the bad burnt/oily texture and flavor. I'm very disappointed Be warned I do not recommend ordering this. It really should be taken off the menu. I usually enjoy eating here but will taking a hiatus.	2star
I came across Glasserie while walking my dog on Commercial Street and I decided to try it out last night.  The space is located right next door to the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory and still smelled like new wood and paint as we walked in through the door. I'm always a little nervous trying out new restaurants before they work out all of the kinks, but it's obvious these guys were pros as we experienced no 'new-opening' issues at all.   The cocktails were fantastic, the food was delicious and healthy and the staff super friendly. The Mediterranean menu was appealing and instead of just getting a main dish each, we decided to share a few of the more interesting plates, family-style.  We ordered the grilled radish w/ feta, the lamb croquettes, the flaky bread & labna cheese and  the grilled chicken w/ almond sauce dish.   I don't know how else to say it, but it was probably one of the most memorable and delicious meals I've had in a while.  I will definitely be back. I recently moved to Greenpoint at the beginning of the year and have been quite happy with the recent sprout of new restaurants and bars in the area (I count ten openings since April 2013) - some have arrived with much fanfare and others a bit under the radar.  The good news is that all of them are varying degrees of good-to-great!  I would put Glasserie at the top of the list.	5star
"From my wife...There is one star for the view only. Husband brought me here for our anniversary, requested a table with the view. When we arrived, they informed us that they would see what tables were available because its first come, first serve. Apparently no need to make reservations then. After waiting for ten minutes after we sat, our waitress came by. I am pregnant and my husband doesn't drink, so we didn't order any alcohol and have no reviews for cocktails. I digress... As many reviewers have mentioned, the food is simply overpriced. We ordered the Rock Shrimp Tempura, Chicken Wings, Prawn Skewers and the fried chicken thighs with pineapple fried rice dish. For the high prices, I would expect either larger portions or way better service. Our waitress, Maria, didn't come by one time to check on us. We saw her one time when our main entrees came out, but she only asked if we needed more lemonade. We ordered pineapple juice and she left. The next time we saw her was to get the check, which included $4 for the pineapple juice that we never received. Also, we were charged $2 for flat water, which they know dang well is bottled up straight from the sink. When we asked to have the pineapple juice removed, I also asked her about the $2 water, since we only received one bottle. She then pointed to the glasses and said ""one, two. There are two glasses. So he ain't have no water?"". I about fell over. Being 6 months pregnant, I had to work extra hard to remain calm. I just sent the check back, she returned with the pineapple juice off, we tipped 15% cash and left. We generally try to be good tippers, closer to 20-25%, but this experience fell FAR short of what you pay for."	1star
Very disappointed at the service. We asked for four Waters sitting at a four top and the server brought out two waters. We waited roughly about 5 minutes until we had to notify the server that we were missing two more Waters. We place her order and also put in for chips and guacamole. We waited roughly 55 minutes for our food it was 6 o'clock so there's only about three groups of people inside. While we're waiting for our food we noticed that the chips that were provided we're not enough for the guacamole that was given to us so we ask for more chips and salsa that took 10 minutes to come out. Again the chips did not fill up the entire Bowl so we ask for more chips due to the amount of guacamole and salsa we have left. All said and done we had half full two bowls of chips and one extra salsa. By that time we were still waiting for our food to come out and I noticed it was sitting in the window for about 4 minutes again I was very confused why this was taking so long. We didn't get anything crazy. When our food was served only 3 entrees came to the table while one entree was forgotten about. Our server ring in the wrong meal for the fourth person so we had to wait for that meal to come out. We finished our food and waited for our server to ask for the check our server completely forgot about our check. It was like she was day dreaming. We gave our credit card directly to the server and said we would like to leave please split it four ways when we get our bills back we notice that we have been charged for chips$2.50 and salsa $2.50. Remember we got a refill mind you the server told us we can have as much as we want because it is free salsa and chips. Do not bother going to this place is a waste of time and overpriced and the staff is day dreaming. We wasted a total of $100 but now you know not to eat here.	1star
Mediocre over priced pizza.  The margarita pizza was very dry.  Poor service, cash only, tiny bathrooms with water that barely works. No high chairs. This place knows that tourists will come so they've basically mailed it in. You can get better coal oven pizza in midtown (of all places) at Angelos.	2star
I have been going to Verlaine for YEARS and this is the only time I have a MAJOR complaint. My friend and I went on Tuesday, Dec 27 and we both ate shrimp. I has the coconut curry with shrimp and she had shrimp tempura. By the end of that night we were both double over in pain and experiencing violent vomiting. We were both sick the next day and could not make it into work. We both messaged Verlaine thru the instagram account which they post regularly on but there was no response which made me even more angry. After being in pain for the past two days and no response from the management I'm not sure if I can go back.	1star
4.5 stars - the best bbq we've had in NYC. SUBWAY - it's a little walk from the L train, but it's near where my husband gets his hair cut so we went right after. WAIT - came on a snowy January Saturday at 12:15pm and there was NO wait.  Probably only 1 other group in the restaurant other than us.  ATMOSPHERE: Feels like a bar/bbq joint with communal tables (both inside and out) and it's a little hard to see from the outside because there is a small hanging sign, you have to walk in to get to the door.  It's dark, they play music and there's a beer/bar area to get drinks.  You order first then they give you your food right away.  I like that it has a display case of all the food. FOOD: Everything is sold by the pound, so you just tell them how much you want and what sides. BRISKET - 1/2 a pound was enough for 2 of us (probably 5-6 slices of brisket) it was pretty fatty, without the sauce it was SLIGHTLY flavorless but the ratio of fat to meat was good and it wasn't tough or dry at all. PORK RIBS - probably the best pork ribs i've had.  they always tend to be dry or hard or stringy but they were soft, literally fell off the bone, fatty and tasty/juicy.  Very good flavor, didnt need any sauce at all.  We got 4 ribs which amounted to about a pound. BROCCOLI - good side to help cut through the grease, it's a little spicy and on the pickled side - so it tastes like the pickled broccoli ban chan at korean restaurants. there is a lot. BURNT ENDS BAKED BEANS - so flavorful, the baked beans almost had a chili like taste to them and the burnt ends added some meat.  very delicious. BACON ENDS - also very good, a little on the salty side but tasted like thick cuts of bacon with lots of fat. highly recommended. 1/4 pound was like 5-6 pieces of bacon. Overall, very impressed and would recommend this.  The plate comes with free bread and sauces on the table.  I didnt try any of the sauces because they have beer in them (I'm trying to be gluten free) but my husband said they tasted good.	4star
I've come here a few times for dinners and happy hours and they are ok but nothing special. The most recent trip was for dinner and I just wanted to share a few observations.  I ordered the fish and chips and it was definitely the most terrible fried fish I've ever been served. It was soggy, bland, and had a crust which was both thick soggy and burnt all at the same time. It is almost criminal how bad it is! The fried curds and truffle fries are good though.	2star
Had high expectations after seeing the high rating. I ordered crabcakes and risotto. Not good. Sad.	2star
Amazing food. I've come here for multiple times and I always get the Hainanese Chicken. Its amazing. The chicken, sauces, and crisp vegetables mixed well together. Also chicken broth rice was great too. Even though South Eastern countries are known for putting milk/coconut milk/cream into their dishes, I hate it. But I got the Chicken Curry Noodle Soup and it was great. I wont get again but the noodle was amazing. Vegetables Malaysian style are amazing for those wanting to try out more authentic versions of the cuisine there.  Service was nice. So much better than the one in Brooklyn 8ave. Like so much better.	4star
"Absolutely atrocious service. Ambiance was lovely. Food was very overrated. The garden is wonderful but the under seasoned under proportioned food was very disappointing.  I understand the whole ""European service"" concept but this waitress was not given proper support with a busser nor runner. She tried to maintain a positive attitude but a few snide remarks slipped in. Would definitely not come back here nor recommend. Additionally the bartender whom I interacted with for under 60 seconds overall, was a disgrace of a human and the tradition of bar tending. Very sad because the place is lovely and I had high hopes. This was a birthday dinner and that was very much undermined.... Cigarette smoke filled the air"	2star
Very nice interior, would be great for dates. Food was great, portions were generous, and service was quick.	5star
Love love love. The ambiance was amazing!! There's a little lounge area to sit and enjoy drinks in while waiting for them to prepare your table. We were seated in a nice booth with romantic lighting. I was there with four other people and we all enjoyed our food. They are smaller portions but very rich in flavor, we were full halfway through our order! Definitely recommend the rock shrimp and chow fun.. Fried rice was too eggy for my liking. Great staff, beautiful decor indoors, and high ceilings.	4star
Burger and Lobster has a huge space with both and upstairs and downstairs. The lobster and lobster rolls are both amazing.	4star
Enjoyed myself at Habana Outpost. Fish and shrimp tacos were good. The guacamole was even tastier.	5star
Simply put, the food is too salty. This is an Asian fusion restaurant but there was not one Asian chef in the open kitchen.  Chef Talde may have been off the evening we were there but there were some heavy handed salt shakers in the kitchen as far as I can tell.  It rendered all the food we ordered inedible.   Being famished we took some quick bites but soon realized how overly seasoned everything was.  I had the Dan Dan Noodles with shredded short ribs which was made with chow fun noodles (wide rice noodles).  This is an interesting take on the traditional wheat noodles with which the spicy noodle dish is usually made.   We also had the Korean fried chicken which bore no resemblance to the garlicky sweet chili chicken of those famous chains and which are also much cheaper.  Again, the primary flavor was salt and there were hints of Chinese five spice in this dish.  This was strange but I keep forgetting it's fusion so maybe it's their spin on the traditional Korean drumsticks and thighs.  The meat was cut up making the dish indistinguishable as chicken.  It's irrelevant though if the salt factor is an obstacle.  All in all, Talde was a disappointment and the chef or whomever runs the pass should check the seasoning before sending the dishes out. We also had a pretty green server who obviously didn't know the menu that night and had a hard time explaining to us what was in the roti. He had to ask a manager who both said it was like an everything bagel?!  We know rotis and they're nothing like a bagel.  We just wanted to know if it was filled with anything.  Was this supposed to be  a New York answer?  If you're going to have an Asian menu or any menu for that matter, make sure the FOH knows what is what, or else the concept and dishes come off as disingenuous. On our way out, the hostess asked us how our meal was and when we said it was too salty, she just continued to smile and didn't take in any of our feedback ensuring she would not convey any of disappointment to the kitchen.  Oh, not to mention, the dishes were small and expensive for what they were.  Take the star I had to put in order to start the review and take it away for the proper rating.	1star
I did not think this place was that good. It was very overrated. I've had Moroccan food and tagine before all around the country and have had much better. The bread was good and the appetizer was okay. We were seated immediately but the service was pretty slow and I never got my water refilled. I expected a more high quality Moroccan place especially for the price and with the ratings, but it was just okay -- its not bad by any means but it was not amazing.	3star
Service 3/5 meal 2/5. it had a good environment but the meal was unsatisfactory for the price. Wouldn't come back.	2star
Extra Virgin is great for groups -- seven of us had a reservation and we were seated immediately. We ordered the French fries with Gorgonzola dip, roasted Brussels sprouts, and mac & cheese. The French fries were good and the dip had a very strong Gorgonzola taste. The Brussels sprouts weren't as crispy as I would have liked and were soggy. The mac & cheese was good from the few bites that I had. For entrees, I ordered the Chilean sea bass and the lobster capellini. The sea bass was delicious. It had a crunchy crust and on top of mashed fennel that was reminiscent of mashed potatoes. I recommend this dish. The lobster capellini, however, was a disappointment. It was flavoured with mint. The combination of the lobster and mint flavours did not mix well and the pasta tasted like it was not fresh and spoiled. There were also barely any lobster pieces in the pasta. I would definitely skip this dish. For a cocktail, I had the Heartbreaker, which tasted great and was very strong, which is how I like my drinks. Overall, this is a decent restaurant, but compared to the others in NYC and even West Village, it pales in comparison.	3star
Came to the restaurant to have an authentic Japanese taste experience. However, the food was definitely subpar. Watch out for the salmon with rice and uni dish, as what we received was plain white rice with bits of salmon sprinkled throughout. The rice ball however was very good, but $3.50 for a simple rice ball (it's pretty small) is a bit steep. I would recommend another restaurant as this definitely did not meet my expectations.	2star
I've been here before, but this time I went with my whole family for Mother's Day. Food was good, portions were perfect. You have to ask if you want bread for the table. My only complaint would be that my family of 5 was shoved in a back corner where waitstaff continued to shove extra chairs and people's bags right next to us. Will probably only return with a smaller party.	3star
Great spot for fresh seafood! My girlfriend and I came around 7pm and got seated right away. The place is small but you still get a good amount of space when seated. I actually liked how the lights were dim, it gave the restaurant it's own character. As for appetizer, we had the house-cured salmon. It was amazing! We walked in the restaurant without feeling too hungry, but we devoured it! Great plate to share. The salmon was a bit salty but it went well with the bread and this sauce they had on the plate. My girlfriend added lemon on the salmon, which made it better. As for main dish, I had the fettuccine with clams. The clams were so fresh and plump! It was very good. The fettuccine was okay, it went well with the clams but super oily. My girlfriend had the beer steamed mussels, and YES you can actually taste the beer in the mussels.  After we were done, the restaurant provide a slice of whiskey pound cake per person and ... it was quite interesting. I actually ate the part that was soaked in whiskey, it has a very strong taste.  This restaurant was great! Definitely hit the spot. Next time, I would like to try their soft shelled crab and maybe oysters. Everything just looks so good!!	5star
The food here was hit or miss. Some dishes were great--others, not so much. The real reason why I'm only giving it 2 stars, however, is the service. Here's why: 1. Took forever to even take our our order (we're talking 10 min or so after receiving our menus) 2. Took even longer to bring out the food--over 20 minutes after ordering (which during lunchtime is not acceptable) 3. When the food finally came out, they got the order wrong 4. Bill was incorrect I understand that this is a new restaurant, and they might be working out the kinks. But really?	2star
The service and decor is nice. 2 stars for that. The food is so whack though! I've had cheaper and better ramen in New York. I don't really understand the appeal. Am I missing something here? I don't understand how this place exists	2star
"Food is a solid 4 and I'll get to the details in a bit.  Unfortunately service was a 2. We came about 90 minutes before closing and ordered 2 ""pignics,"" the $20 combo with an original size sandwich, chops, cole slaw, drink and dessert. They were out of the original size rolls, so the guy behind the counter offers me a ""shorty"" in my pignic instead. Given that we had just walked crosstown the width of Manhattan, I wasn't leaving without a sandwich. The guy rings me up for two pignics, one with a $14 original and one with a $9 shorty, and it's $40. Huh? I asked him why it wasn't cheaper for the pignic with the shorty and he said there's ""no options."" I think the least he could do was throw in another pack of chips or a free $1 pickle, but nope. They didn't try anything to make up for the fact that I paid for the original but got a sandwich half the size. I guess this is what happens when you're popular in NYC: You can start charging your customers the wrong price and just shrug at bad customer service.  Now for the good news: the food is worth the crosstown walk. Savory, tender pork, perfect ciabatta roll, fresh, crunchy cole slaw, great drink selection with British ginger beer and limonata, and the caramels and chocolate mousse cookies are aaaahmazing. And it's a deal at $20. Don't get me wrong: it's worth every penny of the $20, but to me, good customer service is priceless."	3star
I have been going here for months and will continue to go here for a number of reasons. .. 1. Food is amazing and being that I've eaten almost everything on their brunch menu at least twice, the awesomeness is consistent ... 2. Drinks are awesome.  I'm a mojito and sangria drinker and they are absolutely tasty here. ... 3. The service is top notch. You are treated like a long time friend and/or family.  Drop on by, you won't regret it!	5star
"Another ""must visit"" spot on my NYC Foodie list. I came here several years ago when visiting a friend in NYC for NYE and to this day I have NOT found a better Cuban sandwich or grilled street corn.  So naturally, on my most recent trip to NYC, I made my way to Cafe Habana for lunch. With a constant flow of customers and the quaintest corner spot on Prince Street, I knew I had returned. I grabbed a spot at the counter and my tastebuds began to dance.  Of course I started with an order of grilled street corn: mayonnaise slathered over grilled corn and coated with queso fresco and chili powder. YUM. YUM. YUM. One order comes with two ears of corn ($9) and I proudly ate both.  As much as I wanted to stray from my typical order of a Cuban sandwich to try their brunch menu, I couldn't resist temptation. The Cuban came out the classic masterpiece that it is... thick, crunchy bread to support the perfectly seasoned, melt-in-your-mouth pork ... all coated in cheese and mustard and pickles and ham. Ladies and gentleman, you won't find a better Cuban anywhere. Even in Cuba (pure speculation).  So if you've never experienced Cafe Habana, you don't know what you're missing."	5star
We ended up walking out.  It started with the bar.  20 minutes to get an expresso that was cold, because the bartenders just couldn't actually give it to me, despite catching my eye and the coffee sitting on the bar.  Mind numbing.  Then the glass of wine, corked.  So we finally sat down to a half moon table, suitable for 4, to our party of 6 (despite reservation saying this was a business dinner).   Everybody was very nice, but they all seemed on autopilot, with plastic smiles, nobody actually treated me as if they cared I was there. Total ambivalence. So I cant speak to the food, although one of our party says its fab, but I certainly wont risk taking clients there again.	2star
Really wanted to like this place. The food was good but nothing really stood out besides the view. I expect more for spending $200 per person. Nothing special here, no experience.  Service was average making sure you have your glass full. What really got me is that they wanted to get to the table next too me and I had to scoot up every time. I was about to get up and move my table back. It is not like they can't make space, it was very disturbing.  After the order they gave some some kind of appetizer. No idea what it was but made from squash. Waiter just put it in front of us and said compliments from the chef.  For the food. The streak tartar was great. And the rabbit had a lot of flavor. Had the ny strip streak for the main meal which was cooked ok but huge portion. The best was the bone marrow.	2star
"Every other wood-fired pizza is better than this. Stopped by Lombardi's to accompany a pair of Hawaiians in New York on vacation.  Seated after a short wait, ordered the Margherita and Buddy's ""Cake Boss"" (proscuitto, arugula) pizzas served straight-up. Overall, pizzas seemed sterile.  Usually, New York-style thin-crust pizzas strain to hold their toppings (and thus the fold), but Lombardi's slices held together just fine, similar to Celeste instant pizzas found for a dollar in the the freezer aisle.  Worst off, the crust lacked unique flavor as well as the desired stretchy/chewy glutenous texture, instead evoking simple flavors of flour, salt, and char.  This is in contrast with competitors such as Roberta's, Emily, or even Patsy's, which treasure their unique sourdough starters. Finally, service was poor.  After being unable to flag down a waiter for ten minutes in hopes of scoring some olive oil to accompany the dry pizza crusts, eventually had to get up an accost one to get his attention. Overall, leave Lombardi's to the tourists.  Go elsewhere."	2star
Spice and taste galore with flavors that exceed beyond your average Thai palette, Ugly Baby is hands down the absolute best Thai food I've had in the US. BYOB without the corking fee, the service is warm and friendly and the darting smiles in the kitchen as they prepare your delicious meal is infectious. Go there tonight and go back often.	5star
Very limited seating and people line up at the door to wait for seat. However, the food isn't as great as I'd expected given the popularity. Ordered vegetarian miso ramen and the noodles were undercooked, the tomatoes and other veggies that come with the ramen didn't taste clean - there was a fishy taste to the vegetables. Service was nice though.	3star
"Since ""French Dip"" is part of this restaurant's tag line, it should have been fabulous for $21. It's supposed to be the specialty of the house with 5 different versions of French Dip. I'm giving a 2-star rating because the Deluxe Dip was very disappointing for the quality and the cost. I'd rather have a good hamburger somewhere else. And when you add a glass of wine for $13 it was a $40 meal. First the positive, the Niçoise salad looked delicious and I wish I had ordered it. The restaurant is cozy and charming--we sat in the back room which is very pleasant. The waitstaff was very good, attentive and friendly--so I have no issues with them.  But my sandwich. It was overly drenched in ""gruyere fondue"" with an overly liquid consistency. I felt like I was eating a mayonnaise-drenched sandwich from your corner deli. If there was gruyere involved it was highly diluted. You could not eat the sandwich with your hands because they would have been covered in dripping liquid. That was the worst part. I had to eat it with knife and fork. And this was with the ""au jus"" in a separate bowl. The beef and bread were unremarkable, too, without much flavor. And if there was a distinction between the fried onions and the caramelized onions, I couldn't figure it out and the fondue sauce wiped out any complementary taste from the onions. For $21, I also might have expected something else on the side, aside from pickles. But the pickles were delicious, not sour, not sweet--pretty perfect.  I didn't complain because I didn't want to make a fuss with the nice waitstaff and I also realized this is just the way the restaurant makes this sandwich. I ate a good bit of it, but I just didn't love it and would not get it again."	2star
Place is packed! Has upstairs and downstairs with customers constantly filing in. Various take out orders, and lots of people dining in. Wide variety of options for menu. Nice, cozy feeling to Asian restaurant. Wait time longer than expected. Seems a little tight for a place. All ages, demographics seen visible here. A good fit for all! Efficient, fast paced ordering, with great staff. On point with orders, menu, etc. A little unorganized to my liking, not the tidiest place to be at, fine experience overall. Don't let the setting impact you greater than what you came for, the food! Fresh food, straight out the pan. Hot and delicious. Pan Fried Noodles with chicken and shrimp a great choice. Fresh and hot out the kitchen. Cooked to brilliance. Friendly staff. Hard working. Never seen a lady in the front work so much. Literally takes care of everything A to Z. A little bit pricey for my liking. Restaurant in Chinatown that is not the best, yet prices say otherwise. Pricing is the reason for my 3 star and not 4.	3star
Was really excited to have a bday here with a group of 15 friends. One of the driving forces for going here was the Mister Saturday Night music and dancing. However, there was no area for a dance party and this is confusing on the website and not clearly stated. Disappointing. Music was disco all night.  Bartender complained that he isn't paid hourly and pointed to the tip jar after a friend ordered a drink, super unprofessional, Especially as there were 15 of us ordering rounds of drinks all night.  Food was portioned small and overpriced- grilled cheese was burnt and tasteless.  The space is really cool and has picnic tables and funky lights as well as games to get from the bar. There is so much potential for this place but I don't think it's there yet.  I hope to check out mister Sundays, here and am hoping for a better experience.	2star
Still don't understand all the hype. It's ok... nothing great. Nothing mind-blowing. The Vietnamese Crepe w shrimp and pork may have been the best thing there after two visits. The rest of the items, pretty forgetful. Rolls, claypot shrimp, etc... (the Papaya salad needed more kick). Decent bar up front with good solid drinks/cocktails.	2star
It's burgers and lobsters --plain and simple, exactly that way I like it. I came here for dinner for four on a Monday night. Since it was a last minute decision to come here, I called ahead and they said that luckily there's usually no wait on a weekday. Despite that, it's a popular spot and the large space was still filled up. They even have more tables and space downstairs where the restroom was, but it isn't open for dining (probably for private events). I ordered The Pounder ($20), which consisted of a whole lobster. You can choose to get it grilled or boiled and with garlic butter or plain. There was no doubt to get my lobster grilled and with garlic butter though. The grilling gave it a nice smokey flavor and the butter was great to dip the lobster meat with. Every entrée also comes with a salad and fries. I love that they don't make you decide between the two like most places, so I get the best of both worlds. The salad was nice and light while the fries were thin and flavorful. My only concern was that the fries weren't too crisp and fell short, but that still doesn't stop me from enjoying my fries nonetheless. If eating a whole lobster is too much work for you, you can always opt for the lobster roll. I tried my friend's Samurai Lobster Roll ($20) that was stuffed with lobster meat and a light dressing to pair that was yummy too. And of course, there's the burger and lobster combo if you can't decide. The menu here is so simple, but also curated into a variety of dishes that I love. Burger & Lobster is worth the visit and great spot for groups. Random Note: I am in love with the calligraphy for the menu, signs, and restaurant name itself. Someone please tell me the name of this font.	5star
There's generally reason to be suspicious of a dumpling house open in this part of town, not Chinatown or Flushing or Fort Lee. In all, the uninspiringly named Excellent Dumpling House averages to about a 3. The soup dumplings are extraordinarily good, and I plan to roll in and down 10 of these before resuming my day. The rest of the dim sum options? Not so much. There's a weird filmy and plasticky flavor to it, and I ended up just subconsciously comparing it unfavorably to what I get down around Mott Street or the 626*. Radiance Tea and Books remains the other place to go for your mid-town off-menu dim sum needs. Haven't tried buzzed-about Tim Ho Wan yet.	3star
***THIS REVIEW IS FOR IPPUDO WEST SIDE*** Sorry, I wrote this review for the wrong location. Ippudo was the perfect last meal to have while in NY. We were so excited to find that there was absolutely NO LINE when we got to Ippudo. (Maybe it had to do with it being just opened 4 minutes prior to our arrival, but hey, I'm not complaining at all!) We got baos for appetizers- two pork belly and two fried chicken. I liked the chicken more than the pork, but my boyfriend liked the opposite. I loved how crispy the chicken was and how full of flavor it was! The pork belly was a little too fatty, but maybe it was just the piece that I got.  We both ordered the shiromaru and I think my boyfriend got the akamaru ramen. Oh my gooooodness!!! The broth is so RICH in flavor!!! We are ramen snobs, being that we have the great Orenchi Ramen in the Bay Area. If I wasn't going to look like a fat ass, I would have sipped every last drop of the broth in the restaurant!! 8684 reviews with 4 stars, Ippudo must be doing something right. My cousin said she tried it in the Philippines and loved it too. Little did I know Ippudo was international too! This will be the FIRST restaurant I go to the next time i go to NY!! Pretty sure the man walking around was the manager. He welcomed customers as they walked by him. He watched his staff meticulously. If you're with a small group or just one other person, I'd recommend sitting at the bar.  I like the Japanese greetings the staff calls out whenever guests enter and leave the restaurant, as well as when the staff delivers their food. I'm just happy that we did NOT have to wait in line. Although, if there was a line, I'd STILL wait. Thats how good their ramen is.	5star
Worst place I have ever been to. The bouncers are beyond rude. I went to meet my husband there to watch a soccer game. There was a very long line and he was inside already. I am 9 months pregnant and they still wouldn't let me in to be with my husband. Instead they wanted me to wait on a 2 hour line. And as they are saying you can't come in the bouncer let's his own girlfriend cut the line and go in. They then began criticizing me and my husband that I am pregnant and want to go to A bar. Would never give them business.	1star
"This places ""bottomless"" is pretty deceiving. The bottomless clearly has a 2 hour bottom, however the waitress barely stops by every 30 minutes. For $25 dollars you could easily order 4 drinks. Adisa cut me off for drinking too much because I tripped on the uneven wood on the second floor, after two drinks.. The food came slow, one girl at our table of 8 waited 15 minutes after every other person was served. Overall this place is quiet and empty; which is nice. However there is clearly a reason for it."	1star
Luke's is a favorite of mine that I visit anytime I'm in the city! They have locations all over (including in the new City Kitchen in Times Square), but my favorite spot is under the Brooklyn Bridge, where you can grab your favorite roll and enjoy it while watching the sun fall behind the Manhattan skyline. Don't pass this place by!	5star
Bea is a nice cocktail bar located in Hell's Kitchen. I went here over the weekend with friends and family and had a great time. The ambiance is nice and the place was not loud enough where you cannot hear the people you are with. If you are looking to take a group of four out for drinks, this place is the spot to go! My only complaint would be the limited late night food menu. The waiter did not offer any opinion on the choices listed and made us feel as if it would be a waste. If you like Gin, then you will love The Brooklyn Cue and Over The Moon; they are delicious.   I tried the Tottenville Tea and The Paper Fox. I would not suggest the Paper Fox as the housemade ginger syrup used did not taste well. The service was great as the waiter was attentive and knew her cocktails. There was no crowd at the bar and never a long line for the bathroom which is always a plus. I am not sure if anyone will find this cool, but they do play a black and white film on two walls. It is not distracting but interesting if you are into that.	5star
I found this place a few months back and the food was really good this past Sunday the food sucked it taste rushed and the flavors wasn't there at all.I ordered black linguini with shrimp spicy marinara it was nasty and I also ordered the lasagna I didn't like that either the lasagna is sauce meat and no cheese ..uhhhhhh did you u guys forget the cheese.Anyway I will give them another try because in the past the food was great.Get it together guys.	3star
WOW what a surprise! Perhaps my expectation was too high since I've been reading so many good reviews about this place. RSVP: difficult. Just keep trying! you never know today may be your lucky day. we went on Sunday, it wasn't as hard as Friday or Saturday. Food: Meh! I tried better elsewhere. I had to sent back my plate cause I thought the pasta was under-cooked. The waiter explained they cook the pasta al dente (meaning firm to the bite). However the other 2 pasta dishes we ordered were just right. They took my plate perhaps re-make it or something but it came back more edible than what it was before. So I don't know if it's me who like to eat a bit softer pasta or they did under-cooked it. Other dishes like the chicken and fish were juicy and yummy! No complain there. Drink: We didn't drink LOL but I know they have a very extensive wine menu for you wine lovers. Overall experience: Honestly, I wouldn't go back. If I do that's probably because I want the gnocchi and the fish.	3star
The best BBQ I've had so far. In my opinion, it was better than Blue Smoke, Mighty Quinn's, and Dinosaur BBQ. The food was mouthwatering good!  We ordered potato rolls, broccoli salad, ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. The meats are $18-24 per pound. A small broccoli salad is $3.25. The potato rolls are 35¢ each.	5star
I love soup dumpings and this place does not dissapoint. I remember coming here as a kid with my grandparents and we would get the soup dumplings, beef scallion pancake, fried dough and sweet soymilk. That would be the best breakfast ever! I've come here a few times this past year, and I've noticed that they don't make the beef scallion pancake as well as they used to, but it's still good. If you ever come to flushing, this place is a must try. The soup dumplings is juicy and delicious and the soymilk just makes everything better. Must try!	4star
As in much in life most thing is over rated. As famous as Katz's is, it is over-rated and over-price. They gave me over one pound of pastrami on two thin pieces of rye breads with there special mustard.  The meats were great, but not at $23.00 a sandwich.  With tax the sandwich is over $23. There is  a few pieces of pickles and cucumbers. Over price and over hype that is what Katz is.	3star
I've bookmarked The Meatball Shop but hadn't had a chance to try it. So, when I was on a Brooklyn Food tour and we stopped here, I was excited. The tour was to try samples only so  we got one meatball. It was the Classic Beef with Classic Tomato Sauce. I felt it was under-spiced and hard!!! I wasn't a fan! Disappointing. The restaurant itself was very clean and nicely decorated. The menu was cute and the signage was funny. I'd be willing to try a different location.	2star
I had the classic meatball sandwich with meat sauce and provolone on wheat. Colossal mistake. It was dry and flavorless. A meatball sandwich at Subway tastes better. Maybe alcohol would've helped? I've eaten here many times. Go for the kitchen sink. Skip the sandwich!!!	1star
This restaurant really holds true to its reviews. I have not one bad thing to say about this place. Forgive me for not having pictures, the food was too good and I completely devoured it before realizing I didn't snap a photo. I went there today, which is easter and got seated right away. I love the ambiance of the restaurant it is really inviting and old school Italian. I felt like I was going to walk over to my grandpa making sauce for Sunday dinner.  The amount of bread they give you is ridiculous, it is basically a whole meal in itself. I ordered the Carbonara and Chicken Parmesan which comes with a side of spaghetti, ziti, or string beans. I picked ziti. This was to be shared with my boyfriend, we both enjoy variety so picking two and sharing is a normal night out for us. I picked up a piece of bread, buttered it and before I could take a bite of it my food was being placed on the table. They are seriously that fast, I was shocked.  Upon first bite of the side of ziti I was in love. I am always trying to find the perfect tomato sauce and this is it. They should sell it by the jar. Next up was the Chicken Parmesan, I almost ate the whole piece before remembering I had to share it. The breading is different from your everyday parm, but it was so delicious, the perfect layer of breading along with the sauce and mozzarella.  My boyfriend had first pick of the Carbonara and he fell just as hard as I did. So creamy and a light smokey flavor from the prosciutto, I couldn't believe this was my first time eating here. I was immediately planning my next date night. Before we knew it almost all the food at the table was gone except a little bit of the pasta because there was too much to eat all of it.  This is one of the best Italian places I have been to. I say skip going to Pasty's in the city and plan a meal here. I walked in at 7:00pm and walked out by 7:40pm. I felt a little embarrassed because it showed just how fast I stuffed my face, but it was completely worth it.	5star
Great atmosphere and service. Philly sandwich and fries hit the spot. Owner stopped and talked and bought us drinks. Wonderful place to relax and you can hear each other	5star
#Laid back dive bar if you are in this area for some reason. I'm not sure why you would be in this area. I'm not sure why I was. But nice place to get a quick beer if you do happen to be in this #area. Got the #Drunken Fish Soup. Great for low carbing. Had a lot of ginger. Everyone at the bar was trying to tell me how good it was for #hangovers. I know I was hungover, but I didn't think anyone else could tell.	5star
We went for bottomless on the weekend, and it was not bottomless. The waitress was really nice, but she wasn't the best about checking up on us. The mimosas and sangria itself was fairly good however. The food was just ok. My eggs benedict was lackluster, but I did enjoy the fries. My one friend got the french toast and didn't think too highly of it. Overall, I did enjoy myself, but the subpar cuisine mixed with the average service wasn't worth it in my opinion	3star
Food is good, but is not worth the whole production of getting a table.  Also, they charge for fountain soda refills, which annoyed me.	2star
They are so willing to accommodate no meat/fish dairy/egg - you just have to ASK! All in all everything still tasted great and satisfying even though the meal was vegetarian/vegan.  Some of the standouts were the roti, vegetable clay pot with coconut rice, Chinese watercress and sautéed rice cake! Not too crazy about the vegetarian duck as it was extremely oily. Prices here are great and the meal comes with tea.	5star
Update: less than an hour since I ate here and I have one of the worst stomach aches in my life and I'm utterly nauseated.   Blah. The eggs Benedict tasted weird. The coffee was good. The brunch deal is good. Overall still meh.	2star
This place is a must every time I'm in the city. The ultimate comfort food. Always friendly and fast service. Everything on the menu is great.	5star
UH-AMAZING Seafood (even better during Happy Hour) Went here with my bestie during their happy hour as we were told that's THE time to go, and this place did not disappoint. The space itself is trendy and neat, but pretty small so it was already packed by the time we showed up. The hostess said it was going to be about a 40 minute wait and suggested going to one of the many bars next door for a drink until our table was ready. She recommended an AWESOME bar next door, and when our table was ready, they texted us so it was a pretty big win win.  After we got seated, we immediately dived into the menu. We ordered their happy hour oysters, the smoked salmon, and an order of the mussels. Food came out pretty quickly, and everything tasted so fresh and delicious. Man oh man, I can't get over how good everything was. The mussels, in particular, were HUGE which only made us happier. For two people, this amount of food was PERFECT,  and we left feeling satisfied.  Since we came during happy hour, our bill was pretty damn reasonable especially considering the food that we got. Even if it wasn't happy hour, I'd still happily come here since the food and service were so spot on. Can't wait to come back here.	5star
Amazing!  The most authentic Mexican food you can get in the tri-state area in my opinion.  Definitely worth the trip to get it.	5star
Not impressed. The food wasn't great- if you are looking for authentic Mexican go somewhere else. The atmosphere is awesome and the outside seating is great but it pretty much ends there. Guacamole is just okay and tacos were not great. Best thing about my meal was the cucumber limeade I had to drink.	2star
My friend and I came to Clover Club for dinner and a drink the other night after a Yelp event that was held up the block. When we first got to Clover Club, we were highly impressed by the store set-up, the decor, and the host. The place was lined with dark chestnut leather couches and small tables. As you kept walking deeper into the Clover Club, you found a bar set off to the side and back curtain that separated the lounge area. Definitely gave a high class vibe. We were immediately seated right by the large open window frame in the front of the store, which was awesome to feel the new summer breeze and people-watch. Then, the wait began; we waited about 20 minutes before any waitress or waiter approached us. This was a little excessive being that the restaurant was not crowded (FYI, it was a Monday night).  When the waitress finally approached us, we immediately ordered some small dishes for the table and a drink each. We ordered fried oysters, crisps, mac & cheese, rock shrimp and Gruyere cheese. All dishes were cooked to perfection and were quickly made and delivered by what i assume was a table runner. The crisps were our favorite, the sauce that they pair with the crisps is unforgettable. The fried oysters sit in their shell on top of a pesto-like sauce. All food is highly recommended! The gold rush drink we ordered, ehhh. Not so sure I would order that again. It was definitely a quality drink, but didn't fit my preference. The waitress did not check on us once throughout the meal, we had to track down another waitress in order to get another drink. The delay between the meal and the check was another 20 to 30 minutes. Overall, I would say to check this place out if you are in the neighborhood. Neighborhood is lovely and the Colver Club is definitely a great spot for a drink and some picky foods.	3star
"I've always wanted to try this place out and I finally did!  Get the Bulgogi banhmi!! My friend got the Bulgogi ""Bomb Me"" which was the same as mine except it had an egg in it and the Loaded Joju Banh Mi Fries which were fries with an egg on top.  The restaurant is really clean and cute. The prices are decent ($6.99 for the bulgogi and $8.49 for ""bomb me""). The staff is quick and very friendly."	4star
I've seen this place so many times and was super excited to finally try it out! My friend and I had reservations for a Friday night; the host said that the wait would have been an hour without so calling in advance is definitely recommended! Our server, James, was the absolute best. Friendly and kind, explaining every item on the menu thoroughly. It was almost to the point of excess but was appreciated nonetheless! For food, my friend and I split a side of the Brussel sprouts. They were..... awful, to say the least. Cold and slimy, with an overpowering peanut sauce that made the whole mixture worse, not better. Our main courses were better - I got the Truffle Creme udon with crab and mushroom ($22) and my friend ordered the Tan Tan udon ($20). We both got the large order of the thick noodles, it's interesting that the prices are the same regardless of size.... I like (and hate) that it encourages you to eat more! My udon was delicious. The broth was so creamy and rich, it tasted like liquid truffle cream and was absolutely perfect for the winter. If you're not into super heavy, heart-attack inducing broth, don't order it. But I am apparently! I unfortunately found a piece of hair in my soup which made the whole meal less enjoyable (otherwise this review would definitely be at least 4 stars). My friend thought the Tan Tan udon was mediocre, spicier than expected with a strange nutty taste reminiscent to that of the Brussel sprouts. Portion sizes were huge, though somehow we both managed to get through the majority of our bowls. Overall, a generally positive experience here with a few mishaps. I'd like try out more of the menu in the future! My friend pointed out that the sizzling sukiyaki udon is some of the best she's had, so I'll have to come back for that!	3star
Alright so first time for real NY pizza in Brooklyn NY.  Pizza was very good, we had the margherita pizza, wine and cheese cake.  They have their pizza recipe down.	4star
I purchase the Groupon meal. They are very sneaky, when it comes to the bill. I am never doing a Groupon or eating here. The view is good and the place is nice but stay away. Go party but no way, they need to come up with a better system for the Groupon and food. They are pretty much tricking everyone. Very deceiving and sneaky.	1star
I went to vinegar hill house to celebrate my birthday with my two daughters in spite of the negative reviews I had read on Yelp    I was hoping some of the reviews were exaggerated but unfortunately they were spot on.  From the terrible service to the burnt yet soggy cornbread to the grossly undercooked wattle chop   I will never distrust Yelp again.   I also would add the rude attitude of the host and hostess .  And when they say salvaged decor they mean from someone's garbage    On a positive note the drinks were good even if we had to wait a long time for them   My daughter actually had to ask the bus boy THREE times to please get our waitress.   Save you money for someplace that actually appreciated your business	2star
Used LevelUp here at their most nautical location near the iconic Bridge. Staff handled the absurd lines quite well, and the product held up.	4star
My husband recommended the place- he had been before. We started with the crab toast and liver pate- both good..lots of garlic in one of them..think it might of been the crab. For our main course I had the special Black Sea bass with potatoes and spinach. I found this dish flat- with no seasoning except for a drop of chili oil on the fish. The fish was prepared very nicely with a nice crisp sear on it but the potatoes and spinach seemed just boiled and lacked even salt. The wait staff was great and attentive- no issues. Space a little loud if you are trying to have a conversation..a little tough.	3star
Although the food was super bland, my fiancé and I still managed to food poisoning for 10 hours that night! They used cheap, fatty (yet tough) beef. My cousin's pork soup had grey meat and burnt octopus in it???? She didn't touch hers as she doesn't like seafood, hence ordering pork. The dumplings were decent but those are pretty hard to screw up. The dry noodles with minced pork tasted like sticky noodles with French onion soup poured over...VERY little meat, all onions. Also, after seeing how dirty the place was (don't even attempt the bathrooms if you want to be able to finish your dinner), the food poisoning wasn't all that surprising.	1star
Not good. My party of four went to Tanner Smiths on Tuesday, March 14, 2017 as we thought the snow covered streets would keep many away. The food was horrible. We ordered the Flank Steak, 3 Pot Pie Trio special, Lollipop meatballs and Pretzel everything. The pretzels were good, but everything elder was below average or horrific.  Visiting New York from Florida and we have been out everyday for lunch and dinner. This was the only place where we have been disappointed. Additionally, the cost point this places goes too does not meet its performance. In fact, Judge Roy Bean Public House, O'Lunney's and Wajima Japanese restaurant were all far far better and less expensive. If you are smart you will go elsewhere.	1star
This is now my favourite noodle shop in Chinatown, and here's why: 1) Their strings of doughy goodness is incredibly fresh, and served with the perfect touch of chewiness beyond al dente. They're akin to the neutral, subtly aromatic taste I'm used to growing up in China.  2) The abundance of veggies in every bowl: the generous amount of bok choy is just how I like it - to balance out the meat. 3) The service. One shouldn't expect much in Chinatown, where every restaurant space is old, tight, and run by (likely) underpaid staff. But this spot somehow managed to exude organization & friendliness amidst the chaos. We ate at 3pm on a Saturday, and there was still a constant stream of customers. I'm definitely going back soon!	5star
Nice place for oysters can be eaten at bar...no real outside space. .and wait was a little long..tried all east coast oysters. ..on menu our favorite was sewansecott from hog island Virginia meaty, salty..Delish. ..	3star
"This place is very dim, small, and congested on a Friday. There basically no space to even sneeze. Our waitress was very nice but it's too crowded. There's people standing at the front door, outside, on the side. It's just not comfortable.  The chicken tasted good and the cornbread was alright but it didn't ""WOW"" me. The waffles were really good though. I enjoyed them a lot. The drinks are like $12 for the cocktails EACH. The 2pcs of chicken with waffles entree was $17. The macaroni was $9, it tasted fine but I wouldn't get it again the cheese didn't pop out to me like I expected.  We originally had to wait 20-30 mins to even be seated. We came around 10:00pm. When we left it was about 11:45pm and we saw a person in a suit in front of the door. So we're assuming it turns into a bar scene that you have to be ID for. Overall I don't think I'll be coming back."	3star
The buns were good but the waitress told me that this dish would not be spicy but it was! I asked to return it and I was really mad the wood chair I was sitting on was old and shaky. Bad service	2star
This food is better for your Instagram feed than it is for your stomach. I went here at 10:00 on a Sunday - we didn't have a wait, but it was already starting to get busy. They stuck us at the world's tiniest table, which I actually couldn't even get out of. We had to move the whole table for me to get up, and I am not a large person.  I ordered the green shakshuka and my friend ordered the rosewater waffle. I was very excited for the shakshuka, but it was not great. The eggs were overcooked and rubbery and the shakshuka itself was watery. It basically tasted like well-done eggs in tomatillo salsa. The flavor of the salsa itself wasn't bad, but it was boring, a bad texture, and not even close to enough food! There were two tiny pieces of challah toast on the side. Two hours after this meal, I was STARVING. My friend got the waffle, which she enjoyed. The waffle itself was very plain - I don't think the rosewater flavor was in there at all - but the honey syrup and the yogurt on top are great.  Our service was very attentive and good. We had a friendly waitress and never had to ask for attention or more water. But the food itself isn't worth the trip, especially not if you have to wait.	2star
Do NOT have your wedding at My Moon - you'll risk getting your date cancelled at the last minute. Three months before our wedding we got an email from My Moon saying they mistakenly double-booked our date due to an electrical/hard drive issue and had to reschedule us.  Seems unbelievable, right?  Even though we had a signed contract and had given them a cash deposit, the other couple had apparently signed first so we lost the date.  Even though My Moon was apologetic, they felt that offering a 10% discount for this last minute change was adequate.  They actually didn't think 3 months was last minute!  I'm sorry but it is.  We had booked photographer and DJ (and paid them non-refundable deposits for that date), and since we'd sent out Save-The-Dates some of our guests had booked travel.  My Moon totally lost our trust and threw our planning into a tailspin, and 10% doesn't come close to making up for that.  Ultimately, we decided to walk away.  We just didn't trust that they would deliver our wedding as we desired, and I really didn't want to deal with them anymore.  Weddings are supposed to be happy and amazing, and when I think about My Moon I get angry and sad.  They gave us back our deposit and a nominal amount for the Save-The-Dates, but they didn't cover the DJ and Photographer deposits even though we asked.  It wasn't respectful of what they did to us, and I felt like they just didn't get it (they kept telling us that they felt their offer was fair). Like me, you may love My Moon's ambiance and feel like their staff is friendly and accommodating ... but for me the possibility of it totally backfiring and leaving you scrambling just isn't worth it.	1star
Location: located right besides 8th avenue, GO!GO!CURRY! is tiny. I felt like most stores near time square area are so F*** small. okay. stop all those cynical comment. Let's move to other sessions. Price: if you want to use credit card, get stuff over 10 dollars. Well, you can always add topping to get over 10 dollars.  Food: i had pork katsu with curry sauce, extra curry sauce and eggs. Well, I love the curry sauce as well as the pork katsu. The only thing I dislike is their rice. Not something i appreciate  service: very informative, and nice to let me decide. And attitude is pretty welcoming Overall: 3.5 for a quick bite for lunch.	3star

I went for the first time the other night with a friend who lives nearby, and promptly scolded her for never having taken me there before. Granted, it was pretty late on a weeknight, so the fifth star is pending further patronage. But everything about it was phenomenal. The food, the prices, the ambiance. Seriously, best french fries I've had in a very long time. I also had the grilled cheese, which was gooey and delicious, and a glass of the chardonnay, which wasn't anything special (but I wasn't expecting it to be, so it didn't disappoint).  The back yard is beautiful. It was warm and nighttime when I was there, and I could totally picture sharing either a romantic evening or a night out with friends. It could use with a few more lanterns, though. And I'm confused as to why the only table out back where smoking is allowed is the one closest to the indoor seating... Overall, I had a great time here. I can't wait to go back! (That's right, Sunday Brunch, I'm looking at you!)	4star
I've had breakfast here a few times and it's always very good.  The service is also very nice too.  The restaurant is right in the hotel - Holiday Inn.	4star
After calling ahead of time and being told my order will take 20 minutes I get to the restaurant only to find out my order wasn't even put in. After speaking to a manager who told me the exact same thing an employee told me I left with frustration.  Very disappointed in this establishment and  will not be back.	1star
Beware that the cobb with pulled chicken includes heavy bbq sauce on the chicken . . . and half a deviled egg instead of the sliced whole egg or two you might expect with a cobb.  Way too sweet.  My friend liked his chicken and waffle, though.	3star
I have been here several times before. I like to bring family who are vacationing as part of the NYC tour. This time I came with my family, sister and niece. Oddly enough they had never been here, typical NYers!! Anyhow, the food was good though my sister prefers her Flushing dim sum place. There was a line, we waited. When we sat down, we took time to read over the menu and decide. We ordered over $120 worth of food! I would expect goid service for high priced dim sum. The male waiters were okay but the only female waiting the tables was rude as heck. She even took plates from the table that we were still eating from...with food on it !! Let's just say I am no longer stopping in here with my tours!!	2star
The corn definitely lived up to the hype but the taco pastor was average. The meat in the taco was good but, overall, something was missing.  Went a little before dinner time on a weeknight, so didn't have to wait at all. Service was fast, but servers were not very welcoming. They were just sitting off to the side and didn't really do anything. But hey, I guess if I worked in an AC-less restaurant on a hot summer day, I'd be pretty grumpy and annoyed too *shrugs*	2star
Loved the Italian interior, very similar to design at Tony's Di Napoli. We were seated promptly and the extensive menu was on the wall. The dishes are HUGE and each can serve 3-4 people. We ordered the clams with white sauce with tomatoes for starters. The clams were fresh and the sauce was absolutely stunning. We ordered more bread to soak up the liquid gold. I wish there were more clams though! We got the penne ragu to share. The meat sauce was good but quite typical. It came with an assortment of meats which were delicious, but also extremely fatty. Awesome portion for the price, and cool place to share food.	4star
"I really wanted to like this place. I have an obsession with pizza. My bff lives in Brooklyn, and knowing I LOVE PIZZA, planned for us to come here when I went to visit.  What I liked most was that we got to eat almost immediately. They have tons of pies available to purchases slices, so that's what we did. I was told you go to L&B for the square pizza. So I got 2 slices. My friend got the triangle. I did try a bite of hers but didn't think it to be anything spectacular. The square pizza... thick and saucy. Maybe too saucy. I typically love lots of sauce, but L&B's sauce was a tad on the sweet side. And there wasn't enough cheese on top, so the cheese/sauce ratio was completely off.  After we finished our pizza, we each ordered Spumoni. Um. I've definitely had better. It was too ""icy"" and not creamy enough. Meh."	3star
You might think The Smith is your basic straightforward Manhattan brunch place - but it's definitely not. I went in on a late Tuesday afternoon and was pretty excited to just have a simple lunch with my mother. The menu is pretty great and offers variety from if you want a lobster roll or a simple salad. Their homemade sodas are nothing special; the agave lemonade just tasted like a lemony virgin mojito. The mac and cheese though is AMAZING. This the type of mac and cheese where the cheese isn't too overpowering and the crunchy top adds that extra texture. The grilled chicken sandwich and avocado toast weren't bad but not anything extremely unique. Overall, the food is filling and the ambiance is pretty nice. The doors were wide open and welcoming since it was exceptionally nice weather when I went to the restaurant.  Would definitely recommend to others and will definitely return to try their brunch menu!	4star
My friend and I ate at Root & Bone during their Restaurant Week on a weekday afternoon for a late 3:30pm lunch. The restaurant was not crowded but fairly filled. The decorations and atmosphere has a wooden rustic country feel. It's a really cute restaurant and I loved it. I was really happy with my Restaurant Week experience at Root & Bone. I was so full at the end I even packed my food to go. The restaurant week menu let's you pick 1 appetizer, entree, dessert and side dish to share for the table.  For appetizers we got the devil eggs and biscuits. Both were delicious, especially the biscuits! Definitely my favorite of the meal. For the entree we both got the chicken and waffle and the Mac n cheese side for the table. The wing of the chicken was juicy and tender. It meshed really well with the waffle and different syrups and sauces. The thigh of the chicken was a lot drier. At that point I was so full I couldn't even finish the chicken. The Mac n cheese was the perfect amount of cheesy and crunchiness. Probably one of the better ones I've had. We topped off the meal with different flavored gelato, but honestly as good as it was, we were stuffed to the max.  Overall, great restaurant but chicken could be made juicier. Really good value for restaurant week!	4star
Stopped by for a glass of wine and a bite to eat. The staff was great but I can't say the same for the chef... there was a weird vibe as soon as we walked in so we just ordered one appetizer to see how things would go. The chef was standing outside looking through the window right next to my wife with his arms crossed glaring at the both of us as we were eating. There were some remarks thats we overheard and quickly decided it was time to go. The octopus we has tasted great, but having to deal with that guy is not worth it. Not sure if he was drunk or just an asshole.	1star
I always heard good reviews about Burger & Lobster in Flatiron but there is a new one in Midtown. It's been open a month and I wasn't disappointed. I had the Lobster Po'Boy. I'm not a fan of cold lobster rolls. The fries were great as well.  The food there was good enough for me to try dessert. There is a cheesecake in a jar which melts on taste.  Definitely worth it!	4star
It's a great day when soup dumplings are that much closer to me, thanks to the addition of this Downtown Brooklyn dumpling spot. It's also worth noting that they sell a pretty good variety of other dishes, in case you hate dumplings, although what kind of person hates dumplings? Psycho. Went here for a late lunch after a long morning of jury duty. Even at 2pm this place was pretty busy, but cleared out shortly after I was seated. I ordered 4 crab and pork dumplings, 4 pork dumplings, and a hot and sour soup.  The dumplings are definitely legit. They have that delicate, thin skin and the distinct shape (with that little twist at the top). Both types of dumplings were delicious, perfectly fragrant soup broth and just the right amount of tender, meaty filling. I found the crab and pork ones to be superior to the pork ones and would probably just go with those next time. The hot and sour soup had good ingredients, but the soup itself was too vinegary. Cut back on the vinegar and it's a perfectly decent soup. It's definitely quite pricey, especially compared to any of the joints in Chinatown, but you pay a premium for a nicer, cleaner, more sanitary atmosphere, better service, and more white people eating in this one dumpling place than all Chinatown places combined on any given night.	4star
Restaurant Week Fail.  I don't know why I bother with this month-long obscenity.  It's almost always a failure.  There are only a few exceptions to this bad track record, but Lure is not one of them. Let's make this short.  I started with the Tempura Shrimp(Spicy Sesame Mayo), which was overcooked.  The shrimp was rubbery and tough to chew.  Moving onto my entree: the Nori Crusted Tuna(Garlic Fried Rice, Broccoli, Citrus Emulsion); the tuna did not taste fresh and with the crust, it was akin to eating bland protein wrapped in sandpaper.  Not mouth friendly.  The last course, the Warm Chocolate Cake(Salted Caramel Ice Cream / Popcorn Brittle), seemed to be a favorite among the group, but I thought it was extremely rich for my taste.  The ice cream helped a bit, but the popcorn was confusing and unnecessary. As a seafood restaurant, they are ironically untalented in cooking ocean specimens.  I'm semi-OK with the fact that I tried it at Restaurant Week prices because otherwise, it would have cost close to $100 for the same unworthy meal.	2star
I don't know what happened here!! I've lived in the neighborhood for over eight years was excited for this place! It has provided some great service and food over the years but has dwindled down to minimal service and I've left without eating a bite today! They weren't interested in helping anyone! I didn't go in with a family just a friend, and he couldn't the Vegana(his only option -because they didn't have the veggie mix! Thanks for telling me I should eat at home and save my money for places that pay attention and have food!	1star
Went there the other night with my girlfriend for a date night out. We were super excited to try the burgers and food but were really underwhelmed with the actual experience.  First, it took forever to actually order a beer and get a waiter. If you wanted another beer, forget about it.  We went with the pulled pork pierogies and pickled veggies for apps. Not bad, but the pierogies had no flavor. Really a bummer.  My GF got the burger and although it was cooked perfectly, there was no flavor and tasted just like plain ground beef. Definitely not one of NYC's best. Not even a neighborhood best. Goulash was alright, nothing crazy.  Overall, the long waits and no service just amplified the 'meh' food. Won't be going back. Recommend other burger joints in the hood over this one.	1star
Came here for casual catch up dinner with a friend but turned out to be a pricey meal! First impression - this place looks like a nightclub. The seats looked very uncomfortable for dinner time & for the price of the restaurant I wish they had changed up the decor. Food - seafood was fantastic (especially the mussels). The flat breads were horrible. The waiter couldn't get our order right after we explicitly instructed what not to put in it due to allergies, and the breads were not what we expected for the price.	3star
I stayed in China Town for a few days and definitely had my eye on trying some soup dumplings.  On my way back to the hotel after walking miles, I decided to stop by and grab a bite. Food: I ordered an order of pork soup dumplings, and pork and veggies over rice. Let me focus on the soup dumplings, since that's why I visited.  They were so good! The only other time I've had soup dumplings was when I visited China, so I'm no expert.  However, the flavor was spot on and everything was just perfect. Sides Notes Ambiance: I went during an off time, but there were still a lot of people there eating.  There's plenty of seating, but I can definitely imagine this place packed during prime time dim sum hours. Service: In many Asian places like Hong Kong, you need to get your waiter/waitresses attention for service.  They will not come by and see how you are doing. Knowing that is the custom, I still think the customer service was really good! Overall: I enjoyed eating here.  I would highly recommend the soup dumplings!	5star
Only regret: I got takeaway. This is a place to stay and enjoy. The dolsot bibim bag is great but would've benefitted from a soft poached egg on top (maybe that's blasphemy -- I know nothing ha).  Could've used more flavor and should've gone for a more unique dish, but overall it was tasty and a nice dish to finish off a hard day. I would certainly go back with a group and probably order the mushroom bibim bap or   eel bap. Lesson learned. Either way, still tasty and still recommend.	3star
To me best pizza place, most authentical place. Staff is very nice, pizzas are delicious and duck prosciutto is incredible. Expect to wait around 15 mins depending on your time of arrival but You wont regret it. Only drawback might be the music and noise in the place, its a bit noisy not best place to have romantic pizza shop :)	5star
This was the tastiest ramen I have had in a good minute. I sat at the counter and upon entering, the hostess said something in Japanese and the kitchen staff responded (open kitchen). I had the karrak-men, spicy ramen, I believe. I also had the orion beer. I also observed how they prepared other items such as the steamed buns and braised pork, which looked great too. Together it was perfect. Thank.you to the waiter Joesph K. for making that recommendation. I will definitely go back when I am in the area. Great vibe and hidden on 4th, but the atmosphere made it come together.	5star
"What is the difference between a good meal and a great meal? Good customer service!!! This restaurant has THE WEIRDEST and most strict policies ever. We ordered the fried eggplant to start and it was good, but it was served by itself and therefore a little dry as it was battered fried eggplant. I'm pretty positive most fried things are served with a dip for a reason (calamari, fries, chicken fingers, etc). We thought a small side of marinara/tomato sauce would make our dish even better. Asked the server for a small side and he replies ""I'll need to ask."" Ok... He comes back, ""no, we cannot do that."" We would have paid for it! Then when ordering my spaghetti I asked if I could change the spaghetti noodles for bucatini. Pretty much the same, just wider. ""No, we cannot do that. It would be too complicated."" Uhh...ok. Anyway, our food was pretty good, but being in the service industry you want your customers to be happy. If I had a restaurant I would absolutely accommodate the most SIMPLEST requests. Your clients leave pleased and satisfied and you've enhanced their evening to their liking. It's really not that difficult of a concept.  We got a ricotta cake for dessert which wasn't that great and the waiter also told me the rosé wine was dry when it was dark and sweet."	1star
"Ya, place was pretty effin good. Cant complain. It was just loud AF in there so if your not into that it might be bad. Staff seemed ""for the boys"" so to speak if you know what I mean. If you don't know what I mean thats ok too. Oh and the duck turnover was straight cash homie, 15/10. I basically was sexually aroused by the turnover, get it."	4star
The host when we went (his name is Eric, we were told) wasn't the greatest of hosts and was actually pretty rude. The seating at Two Hands is pretty tight so in order for one person to sit along the bench, the table needs to be pulled out. At every restaurant that has had similar seating they've helped us sit by pulling out the table, our host Eric did not and let us figure it out on our own. When the table next to us freed up, we had asked if we could shift down to that table and he declined even though that table sat empty for quite a bit. Other parties who sat next to us had their own issues with the food and staff, and that was incredible.. couldn't believe how much wrong was happening and we had only sat down for 5 minutes.  If you can overlook the bad service, the food was okay. I'm not recommending this spot to friends.	1star
"Oh, where do I start.... First of all, this was by FAR one of my favorite restaurants in the city. My husband and I have been to the Greek at least three times. We have recommended it to other couples and I sent my mother there with her friends for a girls night out.  Hubby and I make a special trip into the city from Jersey for our date nights and after 60 dollars just in travel expenses, we like to make it count. The Greek NEVER disappointed...UNTIL NOW! With that said, let me be brief and cut to the chase. We ALWAYS get the lamb chops and usually a fish, for our own Surf n Turf to share. We did not want the Catch they had so we got the chicken...we thought, it has to be good since this is our fave place.    Lamb chops were HORRIBLE! Not only did they have absolutely no flavor(could not possibly have been salted) but they were also quite gamey, which often speaks to freshness. As a cook with advanced skills in the kitchen, I can tell you, salt and pepper go a long way! I cook lamb frequently and these chops had no herbs, no salt, no NOTHING...just meat.  I actually left a chop there ...hubby had one and said, ""BLEH!!""...I had one and had to agree ...the other we left...this was a $40 entree.  Chicken was terribly under seasoned as well...not wasting more than a sentence on it. This review gets one star for the food but the owner garnered the other star because he was quite attentive to us. We asked him for some bread for the table (waiter never bothered to bring or even ask if we wanted) and he kindly offered us a complimentary dip to go along with it.  I could see the owner is 'hands on' in the restaurant and aside from the food, the ambiance there is by far one of the most intimate and romantic we have encountered.   Note to the owner...Has the chef changed? Recipes? Something is different, and although hubby is unforgiving, especially at these prices, I am not.  I will be back BUT PLEASE, please ...take this as constructive criticism from someone who really wants you to be as good as you were my first time."	2star
I'm not sure if you can go wrong with this place, even if you're not a fan of Latin food. I came here with a friend to have brunch on a Sunday around 12:45pm. The place was not packed yet at this time and we got seated immediately without reservations. The Yelp check-in offer says you can get a free sangria with the purchase of an entree, but bottomless sangrias is a deal that they honor on a normal basis with or without a Yelp check-in. It is complimentary with your entree no matter what. Their sangrias come in a large cup and they offer many different flavors. I had the Tropical sangria and really enjoyed the fruity taste to it (orange, mango, and pineapple). It didn't seem to be packed with alcohol but I suppose it does hit you by surprise if you're not paying attention. I would highly recommend the Vaca Frita for your entree; the skirt steak is possibly one of the most tender steaks I've ever had and it was packed with flavor. The strong flavor of the meat is offset by the rice, avocado, and sour onion/tomato mixture on the side (it reminded me of the mild salsa that they serve at Chipotle). I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here and would recommend this as a brunch spot without hesitation! I was able to save half of the dish for lunch the next day, as it was very filling.	4star
"I heard great things from friends about surfish and was pretty disappointed. The waitress was very particular with how the ordering had to be done and bounced around to random people which was really annoying and confused everyone. Then gave us SO much attitude. Added extra stuff to our order and when we told her we didn't order that she threw a shit fit that we saw her talking to the other waiters about even all the way at the end of the meal. About a salad. One salad!!! She straight up said ""I'm done with this conversation"" when my boyfriend tried to apologize for HER misunderstanding. They ended up switching her out for a different waiter who did better but she left such an awful taste in all 9 of our mouths. Didn't ask for drink orders. Didn't ask once how everything was. Forgot to bring an order. All food came at diff times so we sat there waiting 10 min for the last person to get their entrees and everything got cold. Just the worst service. Like really bad. Def not coming back here mainly because of her.  The food itself was alllllrighttttt. Some ceviches we didn't really enjoy. I liked the hamachi one best but still nothing amazing. Some dishes I didn't enjoy at all. Like the crispy oysters for example. I got the shrimp risotto which was reallly good. Def enjoyed it a lot. My friends got the skirt steak and salmon and chicken dishes. Which they enjoyed as well but no one was blown away. Flan was not good.  The bill came back incorrect and had to be fixed.  Overall just ehhhh. Thanks but not again."	2star
"I am so confused. In a city of SOOOOO much amazing food - how does this place have 4 stars?? When we are in the city we basically do two things. Go to a ton of shows and eat a lot of good food. Unfortunately, this was the one night that I did not have reservations anywhere and just made my husband find something that had relatively high marks on yelp and was close to where we were seeing a show.  The place was BUSY. I figured ""must be good"". We couldn't even get a table. Our only option was the bar.  Everything we had was just blah. It was fine. Just nothing special. My primavera had no taste and my husbands chicken was just mediocre as well. Service was fine. No complaints really. I just can't comprehend in a city that is basically the mecca of good food why this one has such good reviews. Maybe I hit them on a bad night? I just can't see myself wasting another trip to give them another try. Meh is right."	2star
This place is overhyped. The portions are small, service is slow and the ramen is subpar. The broth was thin and noodles were not chewy.  I would recommend going elsewhere.	2star
Plus sides: No wait during lunch, decent happy hour, good service, good udon noodles Cons: Salty broth, under cooked and bitter cabbage My visit today during lunch was both amazing and disappointing. I ordered the Sukiyaki Udon with comes with enoki mushrooms, half a piece of mushroom, cabbage, beef and udon noodles. The beef was fatty and tender, the udon and mushrooms were cooked perfectly but the worst part of the ingredients was the under cooked and bitter AF cabbage :( I was on my lunch break and didn't have time to sent it back and get a new order so they weren't able to fix this but it's not going to deter me from going back. The udon noodles were the star of the show! I re-microwaved my leftovers in the office and the noodles weren't soggy. They were still perfect in texture.  Looking forward to the next time I visit.	3star
Got the salad. Yellow wilted greens, shriveled previously frozen blueberries, canned beans, and sauce from a packet. The worst salad I ever bought.	1star
"Honestly I was pretty disappointed in this place. Seen some great reviews. Passed by a few times. Was with a friend and decided to step in.  Atmosphere is cool. Love the chalk mural of Biggie, Steve jobs and an Asian man on the wall (can't think of his name). Music was good. Cozy place was almost full. Service great. Sounds like a winning situation. Wrong.  $9 for 4 wings with a minuscule amount of sauce. Even in the city I can get more wings than that for the price. Flavor was good and they had a really nice crispness that I loved. However they were a little on the cool side. Which was so weird to me. Maybe they were sitting waiting to be served.  The Buns. With a name like Bunsmith. I was severely underwhelmed and unimpressed. Honestly everything was under seasoned. Lacked basic salt and pepper. The kfc was the worst of all. Unidentifiable cut of chicken. It was stringy, fatty and chewy. Yuck! Not to mention it lacked sauce, the only flavor component.  Must be a shortage on sauce tonight. The bulgogi was okay. For what's it worth the ribeye was tender. But extremely light/non existent flavor.  The pork belly was just okay as well. The pork had a nice crispness to it but again no flavor which is sad. I honestly couldn't believe it. It reminded me of the pork you get in the Chinese food takeout places. Yikes! The pork fat edamame was really bad. Love Edamame love pork. Match made in heaven? Not. The only essence of pork fat being involved with the edamame was the greasiness. Honestly the edamame was so greasy. After eating a few the normal way, I broke them open with my hands out of fear of excess fat intake overload. The ""pork fat"" added no flavor whatsoever. Again no salt, a little would've gone a long way. Maybe they were out for the night.  Honestly the best thing on the menu was the Crisp Asian salad. We added tofu so it was a whopping $13. $5 up charge for tofu is a bit much. But clearly this place charges whatever they want. But honestly no complaints. Wontons and pines nuts added a nice touch. Lettuce was fresh and tofu had a nice crispness to it.  Drinks were meh. I had the grapefruit soju cocktail. It tasted like juice. Since soju is basically pennies. I couldn't understand the $9 price tag. Waitress said there was vodka in it as well must've been very little. My friend had the lemon fizz soju cocktail. First off there was no fizz, no sparkling component to think of. She also said it tasted medicinal and artificial. I mean how hard is it to juice a real lemon for a cocktail.  Overall great service. Very poor execution. I don't know if the chef was having an off night or if the individuals writing these 5 star reviews didn't eat at the same restaurant I did. I don't know. But honestly it left so much more to be desired."	2star
Honestly, I don't get it.  Everything about this place is fine.  Just fine.  The food?  Fine.  Atmosphere?  Fine.  Service?  Fine.  JUST FINE. I've tried a few things on the menu.  I usually tend to settle for the market veggies plate.  To be fair the artichokes are pretty good, but all the other veggies I've tried I probably could have made myself, at home, with $10 worth of groceries, while in my pajamas. With the number of great places in this neighborhood, I would pass on Westville.	2star
Delivery: we phoned in, everyone was so pleasant on the phone, and they threw in a Pad Thai just to make friends (it worked!).  Chicken laarb was great-- spicy, cool and fresh. SamTam salad was also super --papaya tasted really clean. Not as spicy or dried shrimpy as I like, but easily remediable. Crying Tiger beef was basically a delicious marinated steak-- cooked to specs, tender-- and some mild, good side sauce. Spicy seafood combo was generous, well rounded flavor but not super spicy.  Vegetable Pad Thai was remarkably plain. Not something I'd order again, but was an experiment anyway.  Fingers crossed that Wanisa focuses on the funky and hot end of Thai cuisine; Brooklyn had enough oversimplified drunken noodle already. Bring on the chili and the fish sauce! Bring on the dried shrimp and and sour sausage!  Delivery was quick, too!	4star
Chill place with seating indoors and outdoors, quirky murals, and a fish tank behind the bar!  My friends and I didn't try any of food or cocktails, just beer and wine, but we thoroughly enjoyed our time here.  Also, the young woman tending the bar when we stopped in was awesome.  Her attitude immediately made me feel like I was having a really great afternoon.	5star
Went in Sunday night. Staff and manager very nice and accommodationing. Food was good liked the spicey meatball appetizer. Waiters very attentive. Very nice neighborhood bar restaurant	4star
Ehhh... what a disappointment. We went here not expecting real Nashville hot chicken (I'm from Tennessee after all and I know my hot chicken), but at least a decently fried bird and real Southern-style sides. Sadly we got neither. What we did get was: 1) a 1-hour wait when there were only two couples ahead of us on the list, 2) a 30 or 40 minute wait to get our chicken once we were seated, while other tables that came later were served in front of us, 3)  a nice enough waitress who refused to carry less than three drinks at a time, thereby spilling them on us every time she came with our order, 4) sides that were basically gross and the furthest thing from Southern, and 5) overly-breaded chicken that was hot but kinda flavorless past the skin. Never again...	2star
Good portions. Tasty food. Can add ingredients on request. This is one of those old school places where waiters all wearing the same uniform, and you get noodles with duck sauce and mustard before your meal, and fortune cookie in the end. Prices are on the higher end but still fit within $$. Good relaxing  atmosphere, nice people. Will come back. Update. Omg guess what I just saw. So these six 15 year Olds come in. They sit down, look at the menu. Meanwhile staff brought water and some tea. The girls decided to order to go instead. So before they could order, waiter made them all pay a dollar for water and tea. What kid of business is this, that you make someone pay for something that is free? Terrible. I don't think I'll be coming back there. Poor girls.	1star
Heard a lot about their soup dumplings but unfortunately did not deliver in expectations.  There are many other options with better food quality and price than Joe's.	2star
Nice restaurant, highly recommended, especially the hand cut noodle with seafoods, and the Japchae!	5star
The food here is delicious and authentic. I came in one evening for take out and realized that I had accidently ordered from their other restaurant in Coney Island. They were super nice about it and allowed me to cancel my order and reorder at their restaurant. The food came out quickly and was tasty. The lamb kebab was tender and the sauce that came with it was perfect. I'll definitely come back to eat in the restaurant. The atmosphere was cool and unique.	5star
What a pleasant surprise in Sunnyside queens!! I did have an advantage. My friend helped create the menu but I had to try this place for myself. Man oh man. The food is sooo good. The steak lollipop are so tasty that you are gonna have order a second round. The truffle fries? Ok. I am done. Those fries were amazing. Fries with bacon, cheese and truffle spells crack. I am a crack addict for these fries.  The decor is super cute although those paper plates has to go. It diminishes the look. Real plates honey. Real plates.  Over the manager and staff are super nice and chill and very friendly and personable which is awesome.  I will be bring more friends here to check this place out.	5star
Best BBQ place I've been to. Deff beats Dino and Dallas. I don't really remember what we ordered since my friend did the ordering. I wish I had pictures but we digged in right away because it looked too good to resist. I'm suddenly having a craving for it so here goes my review. Ambience is chill. Come here with a group and you can order more. You order and pay at the cash register then pick seats anywhere. There's also a bar section and of course, southern music. Food 10/10 bomb. From what I remember, the meat were so tender, especially the pulled pork, beef brisket and ribs. Can't decide which is my favorite. The mac and cheese tasted like true comfort food. I thought the wings and korean short ribs were alright. One thing they're missing from their menu is some good old potato salad. Ugh but I can't wait to go back!!	5star
Solid pizza! Esp love the buffalo and the sausage and good prices! Parking is tough and it's a good quick cheap option	4star
First time here, the wait wasn't so bad for a Friday night. We ordered the fisherman'a stew, and it took well over 40mins for it to come... the taste was ok, but I've definitely had better seafood stew elsewhere. Seasoning was a bit too strong to the point that I couldn't really tell if I was eating lobster or fish, they all tasted the same.. and the stew was over-cooked in my opinion (might also explain why we waited so long lol).. fish and shrimp lost their original flavor, let alone freshness..  All in all, it was a nice little get-together place for a night out, I'll probably give it another try, but I might not travel 40mins just for coming here..	3star
3 stars for food, but rounding up for great service! Came to Thursday Kitchen for Sunday brunch.  Overall, I felt like it was a good meal, but some of the dishes just needed a little tweaking.  The edamame dumplings were pretty tasty (especially for being veggie dumplings!), but were a little heavy with the parmesan cheese.  Similarly, the mushroom dish was heavy on the truffle which gave the egg little to contribute besides goopiness (and I love me a runny egg!).  Ordered the brussels as well, and the flavor was made a bit overwhelming by all the kochujang.  My favorite dishes were the grapefruit brulee and the crispy chicken.  Coconut milk went surprisingly well with the grapefruit and the segments were precut so eating and sharing the dish was easy.   All in all, I could see the thought behind the food, but it was lacking just a bit in refinement.  If they made a couple changes, they could be stellar! Tips and Tricks -Korean fried chicken will never do you wrong -Cocktails are served in bags, super cute like adult Carpi Sun! -Went right as they opened at noon and the place was empty -Handsome Korean servers are handsome	4star
The food here was decent. This one star review goes out to the rude waitress and watered down drinks.  If it were up to me, I would have given her some hospitality tips instead of monetary. We were just a party of two having a simple dinner at the counter tonight before it was even 7pm.  She took our drink order and disappeared for a long time without serving us water.  When she reappeared with the drinks, she quickly ran away without taking our order.  Then when she finally came around again, she took the order of the guy next to us and ran off again before taking our order again. The shochu cocktail had no alcohol in it. The food took less time to prepared than us waiting for the waitress. My friend finished his entree first but I was still eating, when she suddenly decided to show up.  Not only did she took away his plate, she asked him (only him) if he wanted to see the dessert menu, when I was still eating.  What is the meaning of this?  It is pretty obvious that dinner was not over yet.  I was eating a bowl of duck soba noodle. She never asked if I wanted to see the dessert menu. After I finished the noodle, my friend asked for the check.  She understood that.  But when she came back, she dropped the bill squarely in front of me, as if all of a sudden she decided to acknowledge that I was there. Here're some tips for the waitress: 1. Show up to take the order instead of having the guests look for you 2. Don't take away the dishes and ask if people want to see the dessert menu when there are people at the same party still on their main course 3. Don't assume who is going to be the one paying on your own.  Place the bill in the middle. 4. Don't be so rude How hard is that?	1star
Horrible choice for Valentine's dinner. This place was a mess and almost every table in the restaurant was having issues with their orders. We sat around 7:30 and received our appetizers right after we ordered. Beef tartar was ok and my boyfriends salad was good. We didn't receive our main course until 9:30 pm and it was not worth the wait. I had a small, bland tasting portion of seafood pasta and my boyfriend had a burger that was average at best. We ordered a round of drinks to start that were never refreshed by the waiter. I understand that sometimes restaurants have issues on major holidays or can be understaffed. However, the staff of Mominette did little to apologize or explain the slow and erratic service. We were told only after waiting for our meal for over an hour that our food was delayed but coming soon. While I'm sure they recognized that many customers were having a poor experience the staff did nothing to compensate for their inability to serve a good meal in a timely manner.	1star
While the food was amazing the customer service leaves ALOT to be desired. I frequently had to look around and STICK MY HAND UP for my server and I cannot begin to tell you how long it took for me to get my plates cleared. I pride myself on patronizing black and brown businesses especially and I expected more from a reputable establishment. Everything just took forever and not in a crowded way but in an I have other people to tend to kind of way. Getting a drink too forever even after I was told hold on by the bartender and STILL received no drink. Saw this lady in the yellow coat touching tables and was ignored when I motioned repeatedly that I needed someone ANYONE really. The HOST  do NOT get me started she's literally the worst. Like either be a complete bitch or be happy the fake awkward in between isn't working. The food was amazing and promt everything else could use a thorough look over.	3star
stopped in here post a broadway show. upon walking in, it instantly felt familiar and i couldn't figure it out why. we got seated at a table near the bar and given a menu. the menu looks familiar, why? come to figure out this spot is owned by some of the same peeps who also own three monkeys and tanner smiths nearby. living in the area for a couple of years, those bars were regular haunts.  anywho, my group did a round of drinks and me and my old roomie ordered some food. he has the brussel sprout hash (on tanner smiths menu) and i got the chicken mole tacos. for the price food was good, the tacos couldve used a bit more of that mole sauce!  this is a nice spot to visit if you want to escape the tourist crowds on 8th ave and have a refined sip and bite in a more intimate atmosphere.	3star
I had the minced pork bento and jasmine boba tea.  The bento literally had the tinniest portion of meat and it was filled with so much rice and cabbage. Crazy how expensive it was when you can get a massive amount in taiwan for super cheap.  The boba was absolutely terrible, how is that a taiwanese restaurant when they can't even make boba???	1star
Drinks are a pricy love the view, best time to go is when it's really hot out.. the one thing I don't like is you have to buy what's only on the menu.	3star
"First time there- Good experience, got the pressed salmon sushi sets. Very delicious. 2nd time there- Got the Pork hot pot with cabbages and veggies. Waitress asked me if i want brown rice, i said sure, later i found out they charge extra for that option, but she never mentioned to me about it. I like to be told if there is an extra charge for anything, its called ""Good manner"", even thought its doesn't cost a lot. The hot pot consist of 4 pieces of Thin slice pork belly, the soup base has NO flavor at all, the veggies were only a few cabbage leaves, two shiitaki mushrooms, two brocollies. I was left feeing of not being even 50% full. For the amount of money they charge, they should not offer this hotpot at all."	3star
I came here on a whim after doing a cleanse. I had the garden salad, cucumber sushi, and grilled okra. My friend had a spicy papaya and peanut salad and a crab sushi. The waitress was very sweet and even told us about the but two for price of one glass of Sapporo. Everything was fine. I'll come back to try more things.	3star
I had steak frites here and was a bit unimpressed with this. Neither the steak nor the frites were immensely inspired.  I had this place bookmarked for years and finally got to try it.  My friends got the Norwegian and plain eggs benedict. My friends did enjoy the hollandaise sauce on their benedicts.  For the price, you are paying for the name and the rent. I couldn't particularly justify it. I thought the atmosphere was relaxed but also classy and so for that, it felt nice.  I don't think I will be back, however..there are just too many other overpriced restaurants for me to blow money on.	3star
I get this is NY and everything will be pricier, but spending $50 for two people for mediocre food is not right. We ordered 2 rolls, clam chowder, and 2 drinks. I got the one where you can have a taste of the crab, lobster, and crab rolls. My husband got just the lobster roll. They were all incredibly small, and we left still feeling hungry. The lobster rolls on the east coast (Maine, Boston) are WAY better and the standard in terms of lobster rolls.	2star
This place is racist. I am Indian and went with a few friends all Indian. We got cursed out by a few white patrons because the bar was crowded and he felt it we were in the way and the manager decided it was a good idea to apologize to the patrons and never understood our perspective. Whatever - enjoy your place we won't be back.	1star
"Bottomless Brunch!! The whole concept has become an endangered species in NY. I always hear about the good ol' days of a very boozy bottomless brunch. There are still some around but the food is normally subpar and the drinks are really moving like molasses and for a huge price tag. Calle Ocho, a Cuban influenced restaurant  has the reputation of being that ol' school delicious concept with tons of drinks at an astonishing low price. So when my cousins said they wanted to brunch with my brother and I, it was the first place I thought of.  I warn you to read ALL THE RULES before coming. They are posted online.  The entrance is through a hotel!! Past the lobby and to the right.  When I came in I noticed a giant platter with little dividers and a center of tortillas being served, called ""Gallitos"". I knew that's what I wanted. Lucky for me it was for two people and my brother let me order for the two of us. As we waited for out other cousin to come, we received hot coffee and cream and a little platter piled high with little rolls, muffins and one chocolate croissant. I devoured the croissant and I guess it's remnants were left on my chin. My brother at least helped me out and mentioned the fact. This is surprising. My brother that is, not the fact that I'm covered in food clues. We all ordered the refreshing ""Punta Cana"" sangria!! They were so tasty and a great break from my usual beer. Made with Mamajuana, peach, pineapple and oranges. Mamajuana is a concoction of rum, red wine, honey, tree bark and herbs and comes from the Dominican Republic. Rumored to be an aphrodisiac and this girl can see why!?! But seriously this was my first time having it and it was perfect in this summery sangria. The food was spectacular! We ate every morsel. My brother and I shared the platter and it came with eggs, jazzed up potatoes, lettuce, guacamole, sour cream, chorizo and what tasted like homemade tortillas.  I tried the ""Fresas"" for my second drink. It was delicious but a little heavy for brunch. I returned to the ""Punta Cana"". I will say they had to use our same glasses so we had to drink up before we could drink again. This I admit was strange. The place is huge so I guess they might not have had enough glassware to accommodate all these brunch booze hounds.  We had no room for dessert which I know was probably delicious. Next time. Thanks to our lovely waitress Emma (I hope that your name, that's what the receipt said). She graciously took care of us during the madness of brunch and our sangria needs. It's like she deserves a medal for the runs back and forth to the bar! Until next time Calle Ocho! Thank you for my food coma and fun start to my day.  Tip: leave your house 30 minutes earlier than you think when coming to the UWS on the weekend!"	5star
Came here with my sister yesterday, still full from lunch but wanted to eat with her in spirit since we've talked about coming here for a month. As soon as I walked in, I took a big wiff of the pickled carrots-seasoned meat air and knew that I was not going to escape from this place without ordering a sandwich. So like a big ol' fatty,I ordered the Lemongrass Chicken Bahn Mi along with a Strawberry JoJu Chiller (strawberry slush, Green Tea and mango stars). First thoughts: The chicken was fall-of-the-bone tender and well seasoned. I had a huge appreciation for this. I never had a chicken sandwich, under 6 dollars that didn't taste like blubber, salt and bread.  The chiller was something else. I'm a juice fiend and  the Strawberry JoJu Chiller hit the spot on all levels on a day that was about 100 degrees. The bitterness of the green tea balanced the sweetness of the strawberry and the mango stars was a nice treat when it appeared in my mouth (sorry, that's what she said). I took off a star because I didn't like the way my sandwich was prepared. They jammed the pickled veggies into the sandwich, pushing the chicken into the far crevices of the bread so when I took a bite, it was mostly veggie with a little bit of chicken. Seems like they must of rushed with this sandwich. Still a fan though. I'll brb very, very soon.	4star
Wasn't a fan. The food was average and the service wasn't the best for the prices they charge. My friends and I were expecting to be blown away but left disappointment. Even though the service was disappointing we still tipped 20%.	2star
"This is not my fave place at alll. Only good thing here is taco Tuesday but it gets so crowded it's no fun. Have been here for brunch for bottomless mimosas which essentially means ""get one mimosa and bottomless glasses of orange juice!"" The food is mediocre. Not bad, not amazing. A bartender once gave me a hard time about getting a drink even though I was clearly of age...just avoid this place."	2star
Came here because of the many reviews. A bit bummed because I came at an off time before they're full menu begins. No pizza for me (I was hoping for some). But, it brought me to a super cute area (Stones St.) where an alleyway is lined with picnic tables along bars and restaurants. Fantastic! Ordered Manicotti and a sofa. Waiter stood next to me the whole time. I felt like he was watching me, waiting to swipe my plate out from under me as soon as I finished. A bit uncomfortable.	3star
5 stars just because the pork buns blew my life away. No joke, the pork buns are the real deal. I had one bite and was about to shave out another $9 for an additional order. You have to order it!! They're worth a try at least.  As for the ramen, my traveling buddies and I ordered the Akamaru Modern and the Karaka-men. The Akamaru Modern was pretty good. It had a garlicky tasting broth and wasn't too heavy on the stomach. The Karaka-men was supposed to be spicy but it wasn't spicy at all (maybe it's because I can tolerate spicy food to a certain extent). If you are afraid that it will be too hot, don't be. I would say that if you order pork buns, you will definitely be full after you have a bowl of ramen. I don't think you'll be able to finish the bowl... This review is to be continued...AS I WILL RETURN FOR MORE PORK BUNS AND WILL TRY OTHER RAMENS :)	5star
Decided to come here with some friends after a long day of visiting different companies around the city. Reviews made it seem like a great place to come and enjoy a reasonably priced pasta. I ended up ordering the gnocchi which was pretty good.  Unfortunately, our service was awful. I've never had such an odd experience watching a server be so friendly the tables around us but treat my friends and I like we were penny pinching students. He hardly asked how we were doing, he refused to tell us any specials or even offer us a dessert menu. He took forever to get us back our receipts and did not once say thank you or even you're welcome. Absolute silence.  Super bummed and wish we would have went somewhere a bit friendlier even if it would have been a pricier joint.	3star
Food was good. But service was very very very slow.  After initially being seated it was about 30 mins before we seen our waiter again. 40-45 mins to get apps and another 45 mins for entrees to come out.  The waiter was very polite  but the kitchen very slow. I could understand if the place was packed. But we had early dinner and there was like 4-5 tables including ours.  The apps we tried were not bad. Just very small portions for the price. We tried the calamari and were surprised how small it was. Delicious but small. The lobster meatballs were diff nothing to rave about. Mezze good. Chicken dumplings nothing special. Buratta was great as well as the gatsby salad delicious.  As for mains. Our party tried the bronzino and surf and turf. The bronzino was excellent and cooked perfectly. But the surf and turf was ok.  My wife ordered medium rare. It was more medium well and lobster we thought was overcooked. We would have returned it normally. But my wife was embarrassed about how bad the service, since she had picked the place and didn't want to say anything.  Drinks. The peach Rickey was excellent We were joking they must be catching the fish from the bay. So if u want good food and don't mind having a 3-4 hour dinner this is the place to go. We personally will not be returning. They have so much potential. But on a fri night no wonder the restaurant was half empty.	2star
It's worth the trip! When making the 8hour trek from home, Luke's is always on the to do. The lobster rolls are fabulous. Pricy? Maybe but so good and totally worth it. The combo is always a fave. A taste of the east coast in NY...so choice...	5star
Food Was good but the creepy bus boy was a little hard to handle. They were very friendly otherwise and service was amazing I would Most likely go back	3star
We went to Tanner Smiths after an afternoon show. After being greeted by a very large man, we were led downstairs to the restaurant. Given that it was still sunny out it took a second or so for our eyes to get adjusted to the dark. Once they did we were allowed behind the curtain to a room with a bar and tables that resemble what a speak easy must have looked like. Exposed stone, wooden tables, beer/wine barrels on the walls. So fun!! I ordered a Billy Club, a drink made with bourbon. The presentation was beautiful but the drink was mostly ice, just meh and overpriced. My husband ordered a draft beer that was perfectly chilled.  At this point I was so hungry that I couldn't decide what to order - and forgot to take pictures. The options were interesting. We started with the eggplant chips that came with a honey dipping sauce. I have never associated eggplant with sweet so this was an interesting combination for me. It was the perfect dish to start the meal. We followed that with the duck confit spring rolls which came with 2 dipping sauces. Perfectly crisp & delicious. Our final dish was the falafel. It was good but not the best I have eaten. The bread however was so good!! The service was the best. We were not rushed into ordering or leaving when we were done. The ambiance was so fun. When we left a band was playing. I would love to come back just for cocktails, to hang, and have appetizers with friends.	4star
Solid South American fare with very charming and creative decor. If you're looking for a nice spot to dine in Williamsburg, this is a good bet.	3star
Portions were very small for the price , and the hot and sour soup was too over-flavored.	2star
The service is slow and the food is bland. The menu has peppers to indicate spice level, but no matter what we ordered, we received food less spicy than the taco bell mild sauce. They don't know how to make fried rice - it was an oily mess. Wanted to try out Joe's Shanghai because everyone loves to talk about it, but turns out it's another tourist trap in midtown.	2star
GET. THE. BUNS. The breading is so freaking good and soft and sticky and it's amazing. So good. I didn't take a picture because I was too busy stuffing them in my mouth. The ramen is great as well, but was slightly too heavy for my liking. We were lucky with seating and didn't have to wait at all with a party of 9.	5star
"3.5 stars Everytime I've eaten here, whether for brunch or dinner...or just dessert & drinks....the food has been good. They serve a great brunch & the menu is more so fish-oriented at night. You'll find a dimly-lit intimate (but not tiny) French-bohemian-cafe -style atmosphere with African accents that's artsy, pretty laid back & something we've needed in Crown Heights for ages.  The service has been hit or miss. A few times it's been cheerful & attentive. But odd things happen like the waitress will stop & chat with you warmly like a friend but never ask if/what you need - i.e. forget to bring you a menu after the initial chat, or water (at all!) or drinks, or take your finished plate that's been sitting there demolished for 20 minutes. A few times the service has been great though, but other times I was ignored or got the feeling that the staff would rather chat with eachother than do basic server stuff - just like how it is in Paris! Food: *I've had the most amazing french toast with fruit and a to-die-for creme brûlée syrup @ brunch * I've had the lamb - pretty good * I've had the creme brûlée & some decent cocktails. They have bitburger German beer here too which is one of my favorites. The bartender made me the most amazing sangria drink ever (since I said I was craving it) it had so many fresh strawberries it was like a fruit salad cocktail ! The flavor was amazing...then the check came - I was charged $13 or $14 for this cocktail  * I tried to order the African red rice (the yummiest rice ever!) on the side or by itself to accompany another dish I ordered & they refused. I was told I could only get it with that one specific Sengalese dish it comes with:Thiedbou Jen (sp?) * have had the steak sandwich which was great & the burger which was just ok * frites/fries here are awesome  * ordered a roast chicken dish awhile back (I think it's no longer on the menu) via delivery...took forever & the food was all run together & all over the bag when it arrived Other notes: when you try to look at the menu online, you can't read it. I've told them about this twice, but the same blurry, UN-zoomable picture of the menu remains  If you're expecting African food, there's like 2 - 3 things that relate to Sengalese cuisine, Thiedbou Jen (the Senegalese national dish involving stewed fish & veggies over delicious red rice) & a spicy chicken dish & maybe one other I think fish dish. Sometimes they have specials like beef stew in peanut butter sauce, which I've enjoyed at other restaurants - never here - it's very Senegalese as well. While most other dishes besides these may have some ""safe"" African accents, its kinda mainstream cafe fare ...American with Parisian aspects...for the most part - so just keep this in mind if you are looking more Sengalese-centric cuisine."	3star
Bad business. Thought it would be nice to bring my family here for a nice dinner because of the raves. Not only did our waiter miss an order we placed and was unapologetic about it, but apparently it takes over an hour to cook a medium rare filet mignon and sea bass. Food was ok, but service was terrible. Come here if you want to see the new low of service.	1star
Whoa. No wonder this place has 4.5 stars. Service and food is on point. All that is on the menu are burgers, lobster rolls, and lobster. And honestly? Who needs anything else? The host and our server were both super nice and genuinely so. Our recent FSU graduate host (go Noles!) put our name and phone number on the waiting list for a table of 3, so we were able to venture outside while we waited for him to give us a call. Even so, there seemed to be an ample waiting area for standing around in. Our server led us to our table, which was shared with a couple, who was already halfway through their meal.  My sister ordered the London burger while my sister's friend and I each ordered the original lobster roll. Unable to resist the call of my sister's 21st birthday, we also chose to order a carafe of the Spring Fling, which was strawberry basil lemonade, with vodka. It was a little strong, but still very sweet. My sister enjoyed it, which is a good sign,  as she loves her fruity drinks. You could taste the basil but for once it wasn't overpowering.  My lobster was on POINT. The bread is so important and the bread was perfectly buttered. The roll was nice and meaty. $25 is a bit hefty for pieces of lobster meat on bread, but it satisfied me so I can't complain. It came with a side of lightly dressed greens, which was nice but slightly underwhelming. Even so, I guess it was good to get some veggies in me. The burger was just ok. I think my sister wished she could have ordered a lobster roll, as well. Even so, it wasn't bad, just not as great as the lobster rolls.  Overall, we enjoyed our meal. Prices added up with the alcohol splurge, but it was worth every penny. Burger and Lobster is a great spot to take your date or your friends and family.	5star
Saw this place on someone's snapchat so I decided to go one a Sunday,mainly because I LOVE elote.Its a small little place,but when I went that day,I didn't think it would be THAT packed.I ended up having to sit at the counter..place is kinda cramped but they had good tunes,the drinks were OK...the elote was good..the food? Eh...it was default didn't really stand out.The elote is the only thing that REALLY kinda saves them.	3star
The menu is very odd and different. Definitely not like anything  else in Astoria. We came for dinner and ended up walking out. Th decor is beautiful but we couldn't find anything appetizing. It took way too long for someone to come serve us so we just ended up leaving.	3star
One of the best white pizzas I've ever had. We stumbled upon this place while visiting NYC and were happy we found it. Was a little pricey but worth every square inch of the pizza.	4star
The food was great and the service was better. Try any of Mama's entrees and you will not be disappointed.  I had the Drunken Fish soup.  It has a lot of ginger, which normally wouldn't be my preference, but this soup was delicious.   It comes in a covered clay pot, with a small bowl and a ladle, which makes it a good option for something to share.  I also had the yummy noodles.  Wide rice noodles with potatoes and clams.  Sounds stange, but it was very  good.  The owners were super friendly and I was happy to meet Mama herself and thank her for the food. I will definitely be back!	5star
Yay!...What better way to celebrate writing my 200th Review than to provide it on the eatery that is Brasserie Seoul! I am giving them a solid 4 out of 5 stars because of the establishment ' s simple yet elegant ambiance (beautiful lighting), their great customer service and taste of the entrees.  Myself and two other fabulous Yelp Friends went here for dinner on a Saturday night. Let me just emphasize again how much I truly enjoy wonderful company, spending time with and having extraordinary conversations with lovely people! They helped to make this dining experience special....thanks Mei C. and Wendy F.!  Once we were all seated promptly, our spectacular server Nikko brought us some complimentary bread. Although we wanted menu items that Brasserie Seoul no longer creates, it was mentioned to us that they are in the process of adding new food items to the menu. The theee of us discussed and decided that sharing would give everyone an opportunity to try various dishes. So, we ordered the Crispy Pork Belly appetizer and the Salmon entree as well as the Steak Frites w/ Country Potatoes. The Crispy Pork Belly was flavorful and the Salomon was tasty. Such juicy, tender Steak and the Potatoes were delicious! Nikko was definitely one of the highlights here at Brasserie Seoul. Nikkko demonstrated knowledge of the menu items as well as patience in giving us information to our numerous questions. He always exuded customer service with a smile.  Thanks to him and the other nice staff persons at Brasserie Seoul for ensuring that a nice time was had by all!	4star
They opened about a year ago, I'd be surprised if they make it much further than the year mark.  Service- garbage. We were a table of four coming for happy hour and a light meal. There were only two other occupied tables. One would think the service would be stellar. Not here. We had to ask the water twice to send someone over. A waiter came as though we were doing him a disservice. We ordered drinks. They sat on the bar until I got up to get them. The first guy never came back. Another waiter came...same thing. His attitude and face was the mirror of being inconvenienced. Sorry we stepped in buddy but we here so get to what we asked you to do. Overall, 1 star. One of the ladies in my group did let the second waiter know how garbage his service was.  Food Meh. The small plate of seasoned nuts was a bowl of overly salty sunflower seeds glued together. We asked for it to be taken back. Attitude. We ordered the potato wedges which were meh as well. They needed ketchup, but we were told they don't serve it. The burger was fine but wasn't anything to write home about.  Overall- no thanks there are more than enough places in TriBeCa to try out.	2star
Found this place on yelp during my trip to NYC! Read so much about the hand pulled noodles that I had to come try it before I left! So happy that I did! OMG!!! I ordered:  The dry handmade noodles with pork and crab:  Best decision I made ever in NYC! The noodles were so delicious and you can taste so much sweet and flavor that it was just perfect and not too much! Char Siu was made perfectly with a bit of fat and the crab meat provided was perfect as well. Overall a 10/10 experience with service and food quality! Can't wait to come back to NYC to eat more of their delicious food! Love NYC!!	5star
I get Grimaldi's is a staple in DUMBO however, having traveled to Italy and being spoiled by the food in my area, I was underwhelmed by my experience.  For starters, it's housed in one of the oldest buildings in Brooklyn and the cobwebs and dust will attest to its age.  Some may say it adds to the charm, I may have been able to overlook this if the pizza would have been better.  But if I can see dust and cobwebs in the restaurant, what does the area where the pizza is made look like?!  I had a couple friends who are transplants from New York recommend Grimaldi's and now I can say I've had it and would recommend they return as it may not be what they remember.   I think it's just the nostalgia they may be holding on to.	3star
the ambiance and service was very pleasant. got wine from next door. they gave a good recommendation -- both places are under the same ownership. service was good in both places. i was overwhelmed by the menu. so we just had the tapas sampler thingy which was pretty much 3 different sausages and some vegetables and bread. they were all good but i didn't feel like 3 different sausages was much of a sampler of what else was there. they were good enough to make me want to come back and take my time when i order though so kudos. they sell books there and there's a guy with white hair on one of the books facing the tables and he looks like a real asshole. so try to sit with your back to the bookshelf if you're on a date.	4star
I love the jumbo chicken wings! Jumbo being where the wing and drum are connected. The sauce the wings are dipped in was decent as well. I did take out, and the wings were still good 20 minutes later when I got home. Parking could be a pain in the butt though... but the place was hype on a Friday night at 8pm. I might go back just to check out the atmosphere.	3star
Super disappointed by my experience tonight, made a reservation a week in advance, and the only availability was 5:30pm. The 4 of us got to the Restaurant and quickly placed our orders but service was incredibly slow, soon it was 6:30pm and we've only received 3 small plates. We were famished. The managers had plenty of opportunities to make it up to us by giving us bread (we only thought of asking around 6:45pm) or comping a few drinks / dessert, but they never did. Meal was about $300 and while the food was good (not great) the tiny portions and incredibly slow service guarantee I will not be returning.	2star
You know when someone tells you about a fantastic movie, ...that is hysterical, ...that is the best movie of all-time, ...that you will absolutely love!?!  And after all the hype, you finally watch it, only to realize this is more likely just another mediocre movie that you could have waited to have seen on TBS? Well, I've been left with the same feeling for Tabare. Service was defintely not exactly up to par.  Here's a few reasons why - - Staff was not familiar with the menu and misinformed us of things the kitchen did not actually serve. - On a Saturday (when they open at 12 PM) we were told at 5:10 PM that the kitchen would be open in another 10 minutes. - Had to be reminded twice of the very first cocktails we had ordered - At 6:30pm, half of the staff was sitting at the bar taking a break and eating their dinner. - While the restaurant was mostly empty, our meal dragged on for almost two hours. On top of it all, parking in the neighborhood is not easy to find.  While this is not something the restaurant can control, it is something worth noting if you plan on visiting.	2star
Hometown has an unconventional atmosphere.  You walk up to the counter to order and carry your tray to a community table but you don't care because the food is outstanding.  It's pricey but I make sure to visit every year that I'm in Red Hook.   Definitely get the potato salad.  I don't know what they put in it but it's my favorite side.  Get all the meat; it's all fabulous.	4star
My friend was quoted a 45 minute wait when we arrived on a Saturday night around 8pm, but we were seated immediately when I got there 5 minutes later. We were squeezed into one of the smaller tables near the window upfront for guests who don't have reservations. The staff, from the waiter to the sommelier, are courteous, polished, and knowledgable--exactly what you would expect from Batali's flagship in New York. The menu changes occasionally depending on what's in season. Neither the lobster bucatini nor the black truffle pasta I tried back in late March/early April are on the dinner anymore. Thankfully, the Roasted White Chocolate Cheesecake still is. As an Italophile and Mario Batali-fan, I arrived with high expectations, which were happily met. Well worth the roughly $300 we spent between 2 people (which included two bottles of a delightfully sweet white wine I can't remember the name of). If that seems high, I remember the truffle dish being pretty expensive--almost double what the lobster cost. Babbo is a cosy spot with fantastic Italian food. Though the tables up front are packed a little close, it wasn't too noisy to hold a conversation. The dim lighting and general ambiance also feels more like a date spot than a casual get-together.	5star
Taste lobster rolls. They don't have a huge beer selection but the beers they have a good.  Reasonable prices and a good happy hour. Try MO from Maine beer company.  Great place to grab a quick, casual, light dinner.	5star
Great little find. Came here before a broadway show. My daughter picked it based on great yelp reviews. (Yes - they work!). Ordered a bunch of fun apps - great variety. Loved everything. Our waitress was especially sweet and attentive.  We also each ordered a beer on tap.  Beer is not a normal thing for me but it was great. I ordered a wired ginger jasmine kind of beer???  It was a few weeks ago (I am notoriously a delayed yelper) so I don't remember but the choices were interesting and we each liked what we picked.  The atmosphere was perfect. Hope to go back.	5star
I tried bulgogi and Chicken sandwiches with joju fries. The taste of bulgogi is too sweet and tasted long medium heat Meat. It was very greasy. They used dark meat in sandwich. Again, instead of Fresh meat juicy taste, it was not that good flavor with end of day old bread.	1star
Decided to head to Chelsea Market on a Saturday afternoon. There was a wait for this tiny taco place but it wasn't long. I ordered the Adobada (pork tacos) with corn tortillas. It costed about 3-4 bucks per taco. After you pay, remember to hand your receipt to the people at the back so they can make the tacos for you. You can choose your tortillas and ingredients with the people at the back. I opted into everything except onions. I like how you can add your own lime and salsa. If you can't eat spicy, remember to let them know!  The taco tasted alright. It was a little too spicy so it's hard to taste anything else. I think the menu could remind customers about the spiciness.	4star
Very sad that they do not care how long you wait.  I was there today and waited for 30 minutes outside in their door while people who had finished their meals just sat at 3 tables and chatted. The food had been cleared and they just sat there with glasses of water and empty soda bottles. They make a great take out business so I guess there is not need to seat people since they make money regardless.  After half an hour of waiting with clearly no end in sight, my family and I walked back to our car and went to another restaurant.  They saw us leave and did not care.	1star
I was really looking forward to this place, and I hope that we went on an off-evening. The decor is perfect, part do the reason I want to give them a second chance. It has a very Amsterdam feel, which basically equates to modern and industrial but still warm. It is not a crowded space where you feel like your neighbor is at your table. It's nice and airy.  The drinks were decent for their fancy caliber- and the bartender that brought them to us was very nice. Our appetizers ranged from great (chicken liver mousse) to above average (risotto balls and eggplant dip). The entrees lost me, unfortunately. My pork chop, despite the waitress saying would be cooked medium, was so overdone it was chewy, and it was the same for the other pork chop entree at our table. The kale potato salad was so saturated with butter you could still see the butter chunks in it. Our other 3 diners reported a decent meal but no one was raving about it. They were nice enough to put a birthday candle in our dessert. Our waitress also left a lot to be desired. She wasn't rude but she seemed impatient or at least so flat that we felt like we were bothering her. I'd like to return again because I really want to love this place. The idea and the ambiance are right on point for me and everything is decently priced.	3star
Food was good, but waiter was far too good a salesman for the restaurant.  He lied about the salad size - told us the salads were small and not suitable for sharing, the opposite was true.  Pushed us up to a costlier wine.  Failed to mention that the chicken parmigiana was a dish for two and the price was per person, so we ordered way too much food and the chicken parmigiana ended up being nearly $100 with an extra topping- that's crazy!  Fortunately we live nearby so could take food home, but what a waste it would have been if we were from out of town.	1star
A shame such a good restaurant has gone so downhill. We used to love Uglyduckling and would go all the time -- a perfect neighborhood place for some interesting burgers, great beer selection, at a reasonable price. Unfortunately, after the most recent overhaul(new management or owner maybe?) all three of those things are no longer the case: the menu has changed, and gone are the various burgers; the 30 beers on tap was slashed in half, and they don't do beer flights anymore; and the price of everything went up $3-$5 (The $14 burger is now $18 I think?).  And service on a Friday night (not even half full) was atrocious: we didn't get a single water refill until after we got our entrees, even after asking twice, and when we tried to pay, no one would pick up the credit cards so after waiting, we finally just dropped cash.  Such a shame. Avoid.	2star
Ordered the pad thai. It is one of the better pad thai dishes in the city. Thinner sauce with a strong taste of tamarind. Great ratio of meat to noodles, very filling. I would say it leans toward a more authentic pad thai (with a less subtle flavors) than a peanut saucy pad thai.	4star
"Saw that this is a popular place in Chinatown so I decided to grab something from here for lunch. As soon as I stepped in, I automatically decided to order takeout because the place did not appeal to me at all; seemed very dirty. People get all jazzed up from seeing the guy hand-pulling the noodles in front of them but there are a bunch of other restaurants where they do this as well (ex. Xian Famous Foods). The people here don't speak English or Cantonese so I went with the typical point at menu method lol. I got the Roast duck hand pulled noodles and I was expecting them to taste amazing since it costs close to $9. I was left very disappointed. Yes, the noodles do taste slightly better and have a ""bouncier"" texture because they are hand-pulled but that's about it. It was very greasy and also wasn't particularly flavorful. Also, they only gave 5 small pieces of duck. No idea why this place is so popular. There are a bunch of noodle places in Chinatown that are way better than this one. Go to those instead!"	2star
I've walked by this place many times but have never thought of coming here for brunch. It def is a great place for brunch. Came here around 10am on a Sunday morning and it was busy and only got busier after that. They are open early and if you want a table, you should come early; not sure if they have reservations. Lots of bar seating available when we came. Got their Bloody Mary which was pretty good and comes free with one brunch entree. Also got their Sicilian eggs, initially felt their eggs were a little too well done but gradually ended up liking the dish quite much towards the end. Overall great brunch spot on 2nd av, would def come back if in the area.	4star
"Seriously disappointing and barely edible food. Highly Overrated!  Upon entering and politely smiling to the waitress and asking for a table for 2 she asked me to sit on the cold bench by the entryway - the place was EMPTY and I did tell her my man is parking outside and about to come in a second but she was unfazed. I get that every establishment has its' rules and completely understand that if your restaurant is so tiny you have to sit complete parties. But still - the place is empty, it's cold, and she showed zero kindness and/or hospitality. Her attitude was totally unacceptable and inexcusable in my opinion. After getting seated, i realized the whole place was uncomfortably cold not just their entryway - saving up on the heating bills maybe? The short rib ramen was practically inedible for me and I left most of it in the bowl. And the egg in the noodles was overcooked- I guess it must be a choice since how can you overcook it so much? But I still don't get why would you serve a hard boiled rather than a nice runny egg in noodles? Either way- intentional or not- this was not my taste and I left the egg practically untouched. Not enough broth and the noodles are subpar. The meat was too greasy and blobs of fat were swimming in there. We thought since the spot has ""bao"" in its' name the baos would be great but alas, they weren't- only the Shrimp Tempura ones were passable but the steak were meh.  I couldn't wait to get out of there."	2star
6/26/15 Myself, a friend, her new born baby and husband wanted to have dinner at James. We usually go there on Mondays for the burger nights which is great. Today was disturbing. At 5:30 when the restaurant open we were the first ones in and our server was lovely. We had a great meal. Towards the end I guess  a new staff came in but this tall skinny white guy with glasses came over and just yelled at us to move our baby because people wanted to set next to us. We were in the both seat so, we were far from in the way of another table. Not only did myself and the mother of this baby feel embarrassed and ashamed but as did the new customers that came in. When you have such a great restaurant, please be careful of the staff that you employ. Not only am I writing this review but I will be taking this aggressive treatment further, because I was truly offended.	1star
Great bar with some nice aquatic decor and a outdoor area. They have a pretty good selection of beers on tap and the food is pretty awesome!	5star
My daughter and I checked the location out for the first time.  We had a great time, the food is delicious.  You cant go wrong with any dish.  Be open and try a bit of everything it will have you coming back for more.  Then to top it off the decor is beautiful and all the employees are courteous and attentive.  We were even able to meet the executive staff because they wanted to ensure our experience was a quality one. The menu selection, the food preparation and the customer service are all top notch.  This is definitely a place to frequent.   I will see you there.	5star
"Best Tiramisu in NYC. Hands down. No contest. I really don't care about their other food considering how amazing their homemade tiramisu was. The cheese was so light and fluffy - like desserts in France and Italy - none of that dense crap that inundates us in the US.  The pasta highlight was the rigatoni with smoked mozzarella and eggplant - such a unique, simple, and delicious meal. I would personally skip the Borgotti Ravioli - too simple and overrated. This is definitely a family-style restaurant... Be sure to remember that and order accordingly since the portions are HUGE.  Next time I go, I will try other pastas and dishes... but considering how I have raked through this city for tiramisu and my palate leaves me wanting more... I could not give Antonio's anything less than 5 stars - since I licked that tiramisu clean and FINALLY felt fully satisfied and satiated. I thought: ""this is IT""."	5star
"ok, so someone removed my original review of Cookshop because it didn't provide enough context of my customer experience. (don't people have better things to do, jesus). so here goes: my experience at cookshop was mediocre at best. the staff was great (which is why i gave 3 stars originally), but nothing stood out about the food except the dessert. everything was overpriced for what it was and i just didn't understand why. why was my salad so bland and basic why was my steak just average why was i paying this much for dinner when i could have gone to sizzlers for the same meal why is this ahole making us split the bill lots of questions that night. the dessert however was pretty good, it was some sort of a mousse with chocolate pieces in a cup.  this was my original 3 star review (i changed my mind and i think i had a 2 star experience): ""The only thing I remembered about this place was the dessert and the asshole that made me go Dutch with him when this was a first date."""	2star
After coming back from my honeymoon trip to Thailand we had the craziest Thai craving that no other food could satisfy. When we saw Thai villa and the decor, we were absolutely taken back to our honeymoon trip where we stay at a resort that was made entirely out of wood. Mind you our trip was only 10 days ago before coming to Thai villa. We arrived around 7 pm and was blown away by the decor in person. However, the restaurant was freezing and the food, when compared, was a bit too New York... as in it was too fancy up and lacked the raw Thai taste.  Sure the food tasted great but it just did not compare to what we had in Thailand, the fresh and rich food ranging from coconut rice to grilled giant shrimp and fish.  That said, this place is ur closest possibility to a Thailand experience with genuine Thai decor.	4star
Service was good. The empanadas were good but the entrees disappointing. Ordered a special of the day. The churrasco was overcooked and the shrimps were extremely salty and overpriced. Shredded beef was ok. The side dishes fried yuca and maduros were on point. Will probably still try again and order different dishes.	3star
It's not their fault, but we came here upon reading that NYC had a Michelin starred Mexican restaurant. Topolobampo, in Chciago, also has a Michelin star and I was kind of expecting that sort of dining experience in maybe a more modern or casual way. I'm a bit confused and maybe we need to come back and work our way through the menu a bit more.  Was the food good? Yes. Was it as good as the handful of high-end Mexican places we have in the city? As good, yes. Was it good enough that the others don't have a star and this place does? That's the rub.  Very crowded bar up front (three deep the night we were there). Boisterous and bit loud closer to the bar as you'd imagine.  The waitstaff was generally warm and welcoming - even considering how slammed they were.  Well curated wine and cocktail list. That said, we had issues with drinks in general and the timing. Everything came real late drink-wise, but it was busy and the bar was hopping. Also, with such a solid wine and cocktail list, i did get the feeling numerous times that the waitstaff maybe needed a review on what was on the list. Way too much pointing at selections.  Food. Oh, right. Food. The mole was savory and soulful and all those words you want to see when you read about a good mole. There were also starters and for the life of me I don't recall what we had. There was lamb (fall of the bone slow cooked). Great - assuming - homemade tortillas.  It was all generally tasty.    Make a reservation.	4star
I don't see the hype about this place. I thought it tasted pretty typical, though I'll admit I'm no expert in regards to Korean cuisine. I came as a group of 5 around 12pm, not as big a crowd as dinner so we got seated right away.  We all ordered from the lunch special. We got the budae jjigae (kimchi stew with a variety of meats, rice cake, and ramen), dolpan nakji dup bap (spicy octopus over rice), spicy pork, and oh gyup sal gui (pork belly). I thought the spicy pork was the tastiest. Good flavor and not dry, which I thought the pork belly was. I think that might be how grilled pork belly is supposed to be, but I'm just not okay with dry pork belly. Why take a premium cut of meat and turn it into flavorless jerky? But that's just me. The nakji was kind of rubbery so that was disappointing. The budae jjigae was just very meh over all. I like spicy food but I feel like the spicy flavor in these dishes were exactly the same. Everything was just kimchi flavored. The starters were all right. I liked the seaweed the most. It was a savory dish with a slight hint of sweetness.  At the end of our meal, the table next to us ordered the dol ban kimchi bokum bap. It looked so good, might come back to try that. Lastly, a commendation for the service here. Employees were on top of their game. There was never an empty cup at our table and they made sure we got refills on the starter dishes that we wanted.	3star
Brunch here was pretty damn good. No wait time around 3pm on a Saturday, but then again the place is big with a huge bar spanning across 3/4ths of the restaurant. A live band was just wrapping up in the front, otherwise, the atmosphere was quieter than your typical brunch places (No dj spinning tunes, no loud/boisterous drunk groups etc). This place seemed more suitable for an intimate small group or a date. Food was good. I enjoyed the breakfast flatbread..fried eggs, chorizo sausages, and other seasonings adding to a delectable and filling meal. Honorable mention to the extensive cocktail options, I enjoyed the recommendations from the waitress. Overall, a solid restaurant with great drink options in a very touristy area. Highly recommend for your dining and drinking needs.	4star
The foods are good. But!! They are too expensive toward the small amount?? These oysters are not $1 each but $2.5 each. I never saw any oysters like this small. And the beef marrow is so little marrow like nothing...for $10. lol If you are not a big fan Please avoid. The pasta is the only thing I could recommend. Feeling bad for taking my family here... ((	1star
I love the place itself. Great dining room. Excellent location. Staff are friendly and professional. But the food is just soooo meh. I've been for brunch, lunch and dinner and it's always just such a let down. I really wish it was better!	3star
Tiny and cramped space but the food here makes up for it! It's got big, bold flavor with a southern twist! Get here early on the weekends if you don't want to wait outside in the cold. My boyfriend and I were the first to arrive so we got a cozy seat by the window. We were hungry and cold, first thing we ordered was hot tea and I was dying to try the shrimp and grit squares. The grits were good they were these small breaded squares filled with warm grits served over southern BBQ sauce, it was delicious but the shrimps felt over cooked and we're definitely frozen, next time I would skip these and just get the grits. We also ordered the corn pancakes, (these were delicious and had real corn pieces cooked right into it!) Get them! The veggie omelette was fresh and the veggies were crisp and cooked well... I got the peach crusted French toast and it was very good! My mouth was happy! The bathroom was also very cool, clean and decorated with a farm motif.  Overall very enjoyable experience and I will definitely be back just gotta come early enough to get a seat in this tiny place.	4star
Ever have one of those meals where all the food you order comes out of order incorrectly and cold and you have to refrain from saying how you really feel to avoid looking like a buffoon  when your actually right? That was my experience here at Gardënia. I will never go here again	1star
This place is great but avoid on the weekends as it gets PACKED. Food is delish and service is on point. Love the ambience also.	3star
The food is okay here but every menu is kind of pricey. I would not say their food is authentic Korean style. For example, their kimchi was not spicy enough and it kinda tasted too sweet for me. I tried the tofu soup and bo ssam with a friend and we both don't think we will try these menu again if we come back to this place in the future.	3star
Medicore food at best and even worse drinks.  Service was pushy and took plates away before we were done eating. Don't waste time here. Head to lower east side	2star
Hands down the best gluten free pizza I've ever tasted in my life. Thin crust, crispy, not dense... it was an absolute dream. And the sauce! Oh that sauce. It was the perfect marriage of pesto, marinara and vodka that just seems to dance around your taste buds. Top it all off with a generous helping of prosciutto and, well, you see why it's the best gluten free pizza ever.	5star
I love eggettes, especially the ones from Hong Kong, I even have an eggette mold.  There was a lot of hype about this place this past weekend, BOGO, can't go wrong. I came here last night and even though I didn't wait in line, I was waiting outside in a car.   When she came back and said its $8, I was like? You got to be kidding me.  I can get two rice boxes for $8.  But the BOGO deal made me less... I have no idea if the store plans to bring down the price after the BOGO, but seriously can't see this store lasting that long with $8 eggette with a scoop of ice cream on top and some fruit.   The eggettes were ok, I had the original and it seemed like the eggette flavor was not consistent throughout, it was a little crispy, not that fluffy.   Ice cream and fruit selections were ok, not some special ice cream of some sort. They didn't even have a store sign, just some poster by the window.   I can't see myself paying $8 for this.	2star
Small portions, overpriced, still cash only, and slow service. The food is tasty and ambiance is superb, but that's not enough to keep me going back.	2star
"Pretty average dumplings imho. I was thinking about giving it 4 stars since the price was cheap, but at the end of the meal, I decided 3 should be more correct due to some negative impressions. So I got here and immediately noticed that it was a rather small shop, with very limited seating, so I had to put my bag on a chair to ""reserve"" that seat. I had the pork w cabbage, and pork with chives fried dumplings, and a sesame bread with BBQ pork. The fried dumplings' skin lost its crunchiness rather quickly. The fillings weren't that generous, and they weren't that flavorful either. I had good pork w chives before so i noticed that the chives flavor here didn't stand out, and neither the cabbage. The sesame bread was ok though, decent amount of meat, and the bread flour was flavorful.  I also had a can of coke which brought the total to $7 for a meal. Good deal! A negative thing was that there were so limited seats, that the guests kept checking for a table, and being a nice person such as myself, I felt being rushed to finish my dumplings, which left a negative impression on me LOL. oh yeah, CASH ONLY"	3star
The last 3 times I've been to Soco have been truly disappointing. In fact the last time I went there I didn't even make it through the front door because we were barred from entering. Some of us in our party were wearing tank tops and we were told it's not allowed while we clearly witnessed other patrons inside wearing the same.  We also noticed online that earlier that day the violinist was wearing a tank top that afternoon.  The previous two times I noticed that the waiters have become really cocky. I no longer enjoy this establishment. They need to be consistent in their treatment of their patrons.	1star
So I made a reservation and got there a little early I did the reservation through yelp for 10:30pm and then the hostess says there is no reservation made and if we do want to eat there we need to be out by 11pm which is when they close. So rude and unheard. Never coming back. I showed the reservation confirmations email too which u make through yelp	1star
"Been here many times over the years... love the atmosphere, and food has always been good, but not really memorable.   Service is always fine, but never very personable/friendly.    Last night though, we had a 7:00 reservation, and we sat at bar and watched 2 ""4 tops"" sit forever at their tables after paying and tables cleared.    After 30 minutes, we were FINALLY seated, with no apology or acknowledgement from manager, or god forbid maybe a complimentary glass of wine for us while waiting at bar.   And then having to wait 5 mins after getting entrees to get someone's attention to ask for Pepper/parmesan....    left feeling very meh about Mercado.   Prob won't return :-("	2star
"Black People, don't go here, Latino People Stay AWAY!! I went here two weeks ago with my buddy. We are both sushi  aficionados and enjoy authentic Japanese sushi.I found this place during a Google search for Japanese Sushi and I will be brutally honest in my review, the people at this place are Racists.  My buddy and I went to Momo Sushi Shack at around 9pm two Fridays ago. The host seated us right away since the sushi half of this restaurant was practically empty. (Momo Sushi  shares its space with a ""Japanese"" grill restaurant on the other half). There is nothing Japanese about this place except for a few banners here and there, more on this later.  Anyway.... we were seated pretty quickly and about 5 minutes later the server appears, He takes our order which was simple, two glasses of sake and 4 rolls. We placed two orders of the salmon, cilantro, cucumber roll and two orders of the salmon, cilantro, guacamole roll, pretty simple since these were the first rolls on the menu.   About 10 minutes pass and we still haven't gotten our sake. We hadn't even gotten water nor has the server come by to see if we needed anything else, like maybe some water or even the sake we ordered. Instead the server stayed away. Moments later this group of 4 European men (I can tell by their accents) sit to the right of us. Quickly the server runs over and they start ordering. The server is writing stuff down like he is writing a novel. Very soon thereafter their drinks are served, the server even does small talk and a big laugh. About 5 minutes later their food starts arriving. Another 5 minutes go by and their table is full of sushi, miso soup, sake and  sushi rolls. I asked the waiter about our order, and why the group  that arrived later than us and had more people, had already gotten their food. His response was ""we ordered special rolls"", this was his explanation for why our food and Sake was taking forever.  We had to remind him that we ordered the rolls on the menu, not specialty rolls. We then asked about this sake and why hadn't it arrived. He was caught without a response and walks away, moments later our drinks arrived and were dropped at the table. This is after the European men were dumped with more plates on their table. So finally after these European guys are flushing their meals and don't appear to be ordering more food does our ""specialty  rolls"" arrive, This was about another 10 minutes after we had gotten our sake. So we arrived at around 9pm and got our food at around 10pm. One hour for 4 sushi rolls.    As to the food, it's garbage. Stay away from this place if you prefer protein in your sushi rolls. There was very little salmon in these rolls, more rice and seaweed + cilantro than the raw fish we crave in sushi. They don't even have ginger, instead they give you this red stuff that looks like dyed dill, has no taste either. The soy sauce they give you is already infused with wasabi and looks like diluted mud, tastes weird too. If they want to consider themselves Asian Fusion they have failed miserably.  There is nothing Japanese about this place. It's very obvious who the owner of this establishment is, it's an obese white man who constantly walks from the front of the restaurant to the kitchen. You would think he was reaching a mile stone - he constantly walks back and forth and forth and back, over and over and over again. Every time his white girlfriend comes by he gives her a smooch, pretty pathetic and disgusting service and food. This is an insult to the great Japanese restaurants in the city. They should be sued for referring themselves as an authentic Japanese restaurant."	1star
I've dined here a two times and I really enjoyed this place. The interior has a very clean, simple look. Having all white wall, tables, and chairs. It definitely has a hipster vibe to it. The service is great too. Here is what I have tried from the menu so far: -Shrimp cocktail: very fresh and very filling. -Fish entree: so delicious  -Lambchop: spicy but very tasty -Crab tostada: it's ceviche style, so it's very salty -Rose wine: nice quality Would I dine here again? Of course. I just would try something new next time for an appetizer, but feel like I would get the fish entree again because it's just so darn tasty. Especially the buttery corn which perfectly compliments the dish. I would also try the bar next time since I haven't tried that yet. :)	4star
Great atmosphere and great food. WAIT: Came on a Sunday at 6:00 pm and there was still a 20 minute wait for 2 of us! The inside is pretty small so I could see why it would get really crowded. ATMOSPHERE: It feels like a small thai restaurant that's in Thailand because of the old Thai decor and lighting.  Very fun/festive and a good place to take a date or hang out with friends visiting.  It is small inside with only 1 large table and if you only have 2 then you'll be next to someone else with barely a few inches in between. FOOD: Small portions and they aren't cheap, if you're not that hungry it's good to share but one person may not be full with just one dish. RATCHABURI CRAB AND PORK NOODLES - get the house made noodles.  they are thin, curly egg noodles that are very chewy and fresh.  the sauce is slightly sweet but not overwhelming and a little spicy.  overall very good and tasty. CURRY PUFFS - taste kind of like samosas but the pastry was flaky and good.  it comes with 4 and is a good appetizer. Overall, I would recommend coming here to try their different thai dishes (other than the typical pad thai etc.) just be prepared to wait.	4star
We met up with some friends at Dutch Freds and I hadn't checked Yelp so I wasn't sure what we were getting ourselves into. It's a fun little bar with some really delicious food! The service was impeccable and I wish I could have remembered our server's name. We never had empty glasses, food was delivered quickly, but best of all, it tasted great! The ambience is nice and the lights weren't bright. Everyone in there seemed like they were having a good time. Our table of 5 definitely enjoyed our time there. Conveniently located, Dutch Freds was better than I could have anticipated.	5star
Don't listen to Guy Fieri, by far the worse tasting cuban food in NYC in my opinion. The food is tasteless, no flavor whatsoever, I had to add salt to all of the dishes ordered. I chicharon the pollo needed to be cooked more, it was a bit undercooked, the yuca had no taste, nobody even touched the beans, the rice with Black beans was also flavorless, the carne Frita was a fried mess. The atmosphere is pretty nice, they play nice music and the staff is very friendly and attentive.  I do not recommend the food, Guy Fieri is a liar, when have you ever heard him say that something was flavorless or not good on the show?	2star
Yes, food is great!! I gave a 3 star because the earliest reservation we could get was 8pm. So we arrived at 755. Few couples were standing inside and outside. No table was reserved for us. The walk-ins took priority and were seated. We were sat at 820pm. Waitress didn't get to our table until 10 minutes after that. It KILLED my mood and I actually became pretty upset. The place is small and packed in. I believe it was a brother and sister or husband and wife that own the place, Italian of course. Very very nice. Food was amazing. This family just needs to find a bigger building and more employees.	2star
Eataly has brought Italian style to the city. This branch consists of upscale grocery shopping, bakery, cafe, Venchi chocolate/desserts, fine dining, and a rooftop bar/ restaurant. The products are pricey but good. Most of them were imported from Italy, some are local specialties.	4star
This was my first time at traif and I have to say I'm unbelievably impressed. The ambience, food and service was wonderful. The best pulled short rib sliders I have ever had. The burrata and the spicy tuna tarter are must haves !! I did have the staple bacon doughnuts but I wasn't very impressed. Also, reservations are needed because it's usually busy. Highly highly recommend !!!	5star
Not many places in NYC can boast maintaining a 4 1/2 star raiting with 3,000+ reviews, so this place really caught my eye, and spoiler...it lived up to my expectations! But boy did things start off a little rocky. We were walk ins, so the wait was about 25 minutes, not bad...something to be expected as it was quite busy. But we waited about 35 minutes, went and asked the hostess and she said we should have gotten a text a while ago....think she forgot, because right after she said that and hit something on the iPad we got the text. Not the best of starts, but it's about how you close that really matters, and I have to say, this place is like the Mariano Rivera of restaurants. Menu is very simple, but I was told they expanded recently. You can get an individual burger, lobster roll, or lobster itself, but I recommend the Combo #2, 6 oz burger and lobster with fries/salad for $33! What is this gypsy magic that allows them to maitain a stable profit margin with the rents in Chelsea?! And it's not a dip in quality at all, the burger was well done with fresh veggies, a sesame topped bun, and savory beef. The fries were good since they weren't too potatoey, and dipping them in the lemon garlic butter sauce is the way to go! But the star of the show is of course the lobster! The remove the main body and give you the main meaty parts, two claws and a tail split into two to make you feel like you're getting a lot, which it is. A real embodiment of the surf n turn concept, and so well executed.  If you're on the fence at all of this place, believe the hype. At such a reasonable price for a fiest of a meal, this place delivers on all fronts except for maybe the wait time, but that's the only blemish I can think of.	5star
A great lunch, the Flat Iron sand which was very good, love the fries.  The service was excellent. Lisa had the fried chicken sandwich and also thought it to be excellent.  Thanks Brandon!	5star
"JoJu Banh Mi Fries $4.99 - by the looks of the pictures, I knew this was going to knock me out.. Mayo, special house sauce topped with carrots, picked daikon, chopped cilantro and jalapeños. Perfect for sharing. Beef Bulgogi Vietnamese sandwich $6.99 - I asked for spicy. Contents: sliced rib eye with kimchi on a toasted hero. First bite had me sold. I'm officially a fan of korean/Vietnamese fusion cuisine. Sandwich was filling. About 11-12"" long. That's what she said.  Kakuni Pork Belly Vietnamese sandwich $5.99 - the pork melts in your mouth! Fatty pieces of pork packed in this sandwich. So good.. Contents: Japanese slow braised pork belly. Also asked for spicy.  ^ both sandwiches were not as spicy as I thought they would be. It was more of medium hot taste.  Medium Vietnamese iced coffee $2.75 - needed this after finishing my meal. Nice strong blend that kept me up on my drive back to the city.  Medium Thai iced tea $2.75 - authentic Thai iced tea without a ton of sugar. Refreshing and great for a hot summer day.  Current promo get a stamp for every $10 you spend. After 10 stamps you're able to redeem an original banh mi, or fries, or drink with your loyalty card."	5star
This place is awesome. I had the crab roll and it was absolutely delicious. I would definitely get again but ugh super expensive. $11/$13 for a super small crab roll. Ugh wish they gave me $11 worth of crab roll but flavor wise this place is bomb.	4star
Gross. Disgusting. Overpriced. The only thing that was good was the Greek margarita.  The oysters had broken shells all inside. It was truly disappointing. Do yourself a favor and walk one more bock to taverna taverna kyclades if you want good food for half the price.	1star
We were pretty excited when we walked in. First night out in two months since having a baby! Drinks came slowly, cocktail was fine but the wine was whatever and the food was a joke. It wasn't bad. But in the end we looked at our entrees and remembered our appetizers and thought, why didn't we spend $190 on our baby instead of four carrots and a thick slice of celery root? See photo. They tell you they're special carrots but we get better ones from our CSA.  Service was friendly. I'm hungry now in the cab but wasn't about to give this place more money. If you were an actual nomad you'd find more food (and better) in the desert. Especially if you're a vegetarian.	2star
Stopped in with some friends last night. Service was so friendly : ) but my Cuban sandwich was to die for...just ate the other half for lunch and I am so content...like Winnie the Pooh after a jar of honey...holding piglet's hand. Drinks were fine-I've had better but they were solid, strong enough and on the larger side. Would certainly come back if in the neighborhood and craving deliciously greasy Cuban diner food !	4star
Beef rib ******* and really impressed with BBQ chicken . But the beef rib. That's their star. Expect a wait as the line took an hour to order on Saturday around 4:45pm but you get your food as soon as you order and seats open up pretty consistently. Worth the fatty nausea (as I'm not much of a red meat eater). Brisket was ok. Just have a beef rib and call it a day.	5star
"I was skeptical, but we needed somewhere in the theater district and convenient to a show and no chains or tourist traps. Put this place down as ""a find""! I had the goat cheese and asparagus ravioli and the osso bucco. It was amazing and beautifully presented.  A glass of the house prosecco was perfect and ice cold. We finished up with the ricotta cheesecake which I highly recommend. With coffees and everything else my check was just $100 for two people. The service and the cleanliness of the restaurant we're all outstanding as well."	5star
Food was amazingly delicious!! They had some dope classic hip hop playing in the background and a pretty extensive selection of Japanese beers.  I would have given them 5 stars if they weren't a cash only business and had such limited seating. Overall definitely somewhere I'd go back!!	4star
Simply put, Joe's Shanghai is expensive for what it is in terms of quality and portion size. The portions are smaller than your average dish in most restaurants in Chinatown. We ordered the crab meat xiao long bao, lo mein, sauteed rice cake, the cold beef appetizer, and a plate of veggies. One dish that we simply inquired about but did not order was added to our orders as well, which is not appreciated - make sure you are very clear with what you are ordering and what you are simply asking about. Most of the dishes were simply bland. A freshly sauteed rice cake was already getting cold and stiff. The crab meat xiao long bao is the most flavorful menu item we ordered and too heavy for my liking. Nonetheless, it was pretty good when eaten immediately (before the dough gets cold and stiff). The crab meat is not imitation crab but rather actual meat from a crab. As mentioned, the food here is very expensive when you can easily get something cheaper and tastier in Chinatown - comparable Shanghai restaurants are a few dollars less PER dish which can easily add up. Lastly, more non-locals visit this restaurant than locals themselves.  P.S. their vinegar dip for the xiao long baos is strong  ***Cash only!	2star
The best lobster roll I've ever had in New York!   Oh wait.  It's the only lobster roll I've had in New York! But still, I'm truly a fan.   At first, this place gave me the oh-my-god-I-must-be-in-sea-heaven feeling...with their buttery lobster roll, the savory crab roll, and peppery shrimp roll.  The Taste of Maine or Noah's Ark are perfect orders to try these mouthwatering rolls.  I certainly had the this-meal-hit-the-spot-and-I-will-have-to-come-back-for-more feeling.   So I did come back a year later to get that Holy-taste-of-Maine feeling again.  I had that same-happiness-from-three-half-rolls feeling during that visit.  But I also felt a little should've-ordered-their-lobster-bisque feeling...when my companions were gulping down their bowls.   Oh well, I know I'll be back for more.   See you next year, Luke!	4star
First time here, the owner was nice. The waitress was alright... seemed like she was in a rush when were the only ones there! The food... portion is TINY with that price! The black cod was served on a regular small plate the sauce was too salty... it was served on top of cabbage that was most likely pickled with lemons!! Cause those cabbages were sour!!!!! The teriyaki chicken wing, was not as great as other reviews... it was again too sour!!!! Overall, pricey and not good. Spent $100 to try it out... never going back again cause I'm still hungry after $100 worth of food!	1star
Over all ok experience but won't be coming back, the ceviche tasted more like cocktail sauce, the shrimp were rubbery and not so enjoyable, I did enjoy the garlic bread and the corn though.	3star
I can't believe I never reviewed this spot. It used to be my favorite restaurant in the whole City. I now have other favorites but this spot is definitely one you must try. It's sad that it's not my favorite restaurant anymore but here's why it once was: Food was once great and is still yummy. Portions are small-ish, in a good way. It's a great date spot. I recommend the ricotta which I believe is house made. The food has gone in a different direction lately and it kind of fell out of my favor. Service is OK. Not rude at all. If you come here for a business lunch or dinner, which I have, they very much respect your privacy and space. They do not rush you out, which I appreciate. Decor is EXCELLENT. Stunning. So much fun. Bathrooms are clean. Bar scene is happening. I would be remiss to omit mentioning, Locande Verde (with drinks) is expensive AF. It's worth it most of the time though.	3star
"They were more concerned in closing the restaurant and leaving than making us have a good experience. The waiter forgot one of our dishes and he came back saying the kitchen was now closed so there was nothing he could do. Not even ""I'm sorry"". He tried blaming us for arriving at the end of the night. We had to split the rest of the dishes between the group. Food was good, I've been here before and I like the place but it is sad when you can see that nobody there really cares. Ps: the place was empty..."	1star
I came to Uva with a party of 12 for a friend's birthday. Our server was attentive and gave us recommendations on what dishes to try.  For the table, we ordered Antipasto Mistro and Prosciutto & Mozzarella. THE CHEESES WERE SO GOOD. All 12 of us ordered various pasta dishes on the menu and none of us had any complaints about the dishes.  I really like how they were able to accommodate such a big party. Will definitely come back here next time I am going out with a big party again!	5star
Well, this isn't the best Italian food I've ever had, but it's definitely good for the price. It's family style, and you get unlimited plates. I always come here for my family dinners cause theres 20 of us... It does us well, we love the fried zucchini, and the cob salad is so good there. We also always get the rigatoni sausage pasta, and salmon and a few other orders. Then of course the creme brûlée, ugh so worth it. I definitely recommend this place if theres a lot of you, and you're hungry ! Great options, and variety.	4star
Soba-ya has a great interior and is actually a really nice dining environment. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the food as much as I enjoyed the restaurant decor. The food itself wasn't actually bad; it just wasn't especially memorable. I got cold soba noodles, and they were quite nice with the broth that accompanied it. However, my rating is a reflection of both the portion size and the price. I wasn't thrilled with how much I paid for how little I got, and ultimately, that was what left the greatest impression on me.  I ate with a party of 6 people, and none of us left feeling very full, so I don't believe I was the odd one out in this case. It's a nice dining experience, but it just didn't live up to high hopes I had.	3star
I had lunch here with a friend yesterday. I had always passed by the Umami Burger locations in California but I was never interested enough to stop by. I decided, on a whim, to give this one a try.  I don't know if they were understaffed but it wasn't packed and it took a while to get seated. Other groups of people had to wait longer than normal to be seated at the many empty tables.  We sat down and were overwhelmed by all the different burger options. We finally figured out what we wanted with the help of our server whose name I didn't catch. We ordered the brussels sprouts, cheesy tots, sunnyside and manly burgers.  The brussels sprouts were probably the best thing I had there. They were excellent and set the bar high for the rest of the food. The tots were average and disappointing. I only had one and didn't want anymore. My sunnyside burger was okay; I ordered medium but should've ordered medium-rare because it seemed more like medium-well. The burger was pretty bland aside from the parmesan and its only saving grace was the egg. My friend liked his manly burger which was also overcooked.  Side note: I know this isn't the restaurant's fault but when I went to the bathroom to wash my hands, this person couldn't stop knocking on my door or jiggling the door handle. Obviously if it doesn't open, it's occupied. I knocked back on the door and when I came out, this man made a very racist remark directed at me. Later, I saw him just walk out of the restaurant. I hadn't seen him eating there before and it seems he just walked into Umami Burger to use the restroom. This factored into my experience and I don't think I will be revisiting.  Overall, the food was overpriced and underwhelming. The service was okay, aside from getting nudged every so often from servers who were weaving in between tables. Host was nowhere to be found at times, so I'm not surprised they missed some random person coming in just to use the restroom. Ugh.	2star
Came here for a work dinner and I honestly have mix feelings about this place.  We were seated upstairs in the lounge area and had the whole space to ourselves. The servers, manager, bartender was amazing and that's the plus in my review. The bar upstairs is not as fully stocked as downstairs main bar but the bartender went out of her way to get me the wine I wanted.  The food? ugh... I don't even know where to start. The spaghetti was bland, the salmon and chicken was so dry. The pizza, risotto cheese balls and calamari were just ok. I've definitely had better. I'm really confused because other reviews for this place is pretty high in the 4-5 stars range. Maybe it's because it was served in a group/ private party setting so everything had to be made in bigger batches and sitting out for too long before eating? Not sure but my own experience here is a solid 2 star for what I ate.	2star
Came here for a drink during happy hour. Nothing particularly good or bad about it. It's a bit redundant for the area as there are several bars on 5th where you can get variations of classic cocktails. Personally, I found the drinks were fine, but nothing special (which is what I expect when a cocktail price hovers around $10). I've had better cocktails in the area and it seemed like whatever I had was trying a bit too hard to be unique.  The menu is placed inside a book, which I think gives you a good idea of the type of place you are dealing with: if you are looking for a place that has a self-aware amount of pretense, this might be the place for you. Otherwise, it might be best to explore some of the other options in the area.	3star
If I could give this 5 negative stars I would. Have been waiting years to go here for a special occasion. Came after I graduated college only to pay $370 to get food poisoning. Do not bother going here.	1star
Good food, nice location, upscale diner type of feeling to interior. Had ranchero scramble which was tasty, but portion size was small. When they open the glass up on nice days, it provides for nice and enjoyable inside and out ambience. Server was friendly, but service was slow. Restroom in basement smelled like rotting fish.	4star
Had a great time here celebrating my birthday a few weekends ago for brunch! The all you can drink menu was great, but the sangria were a bit too sweet. It's great for large parties as they have a back room with several groups of celebrations. We had reserved for the set menu, but they didn't put us down for it... Nor would they switch us over. That was kind of annoying. The food was good. Portions were very inconsistent. Some dishes were huge, some were small. Overall it was a great time. The drink pours came slower as the meal went on though.	4star
Went on a wed night and it was moderately busy but not packed. So it's not always a line up.  Coming from vancouver our soul food tends to be one off dishes at a higher end resto. With that said if I were doing a direct comparison of the food in that manner I would say this was lacking maybe 2/5. There is a heavy lean towards parboiling the meat without much of the grilled flavours. So the ribs didn't have the same level of quality. There's a chance a chicken was pre frozen the leg has a bit of a mushy texted while the breasts seemed fine. the batter for it was nice.   Apparently the mac and cheese was delicious.  I don't think it's fair to compare it that way. So instead I'll compare it to a diner/casual chain resto. On that front it was on par 3/5. I give it 3.5 stars as the service was courteous and friendly.  For people like me who come from cities that don't have soulfood diners it's a nice experience. And he wine is sooo cheap. $16 for a carafe and it turned out to be an XL carafe. For this price The red was actually drinkable so again win.	3star
"A and I visited Milk and Roses early last evening for a drink. Initially, we were having a pleasant time. The ambiance is great, books lining the walls, very old timey and romantic. We sat on the sofa directly across from the bar.  Our experience was marred by a man (who's name is Matteo, he proclaimed loudly and quite numerously) who came in with, who I assume is, his partner and child. They sat at the bar directly in front of us. Several minutes after they sat, the child starts fidgeting (as children do, no biggie). His partner says something to him about leaving as it is a bar and Matteo waves her concerns away and orders. She continues to talk to him and several moments later, she waves a hand in our general direction and says something along the lines of how they are bothering us. (I think she was just referring to her child becoming more fussy than anything else.) He then says very loudly and belligerently, ""Oh who cares what a couple of ch!nks think?!""  A's not one to hear something like that and let it slide so he leaned over to the couple and asked the man, ""What did you say?"" Matteo is suddenly mute and doesn't answer. So A repeats his question and Matteo's partner chimes in that yes, he is being offensive. (She seemed apologetic and embarrassed.) He then turns to us and says we misheard, he said JINX. J-I-N-X, he spells out to us. ""What are you gonna do about it,"" he asks? His partner grabs the child and tries to leave, he grabs her bag and they have a mini tug of war and she leaves. Props to A for not jumping up and punching him right there.  We had just gotten our drinks and not even our food at that point. We debate whether or not to leave and decide to stay and not let one man's actions ruin our night. Meanwhile, he walks out of the place then walks back in, starts walking around and talking loudly to other patrons, shaking hands and joking with the staff there. He sits back down and then turns to us and hands us a piece of paper that says JINX. ""That's what I said,"" he professes.  That was the last straw. We decided to pay and leave.  What irks me about this whole debacle besides the obvious, is that the whole time he was going about and shooting his mouth off, no one who works at this establishment did anything about it. Not even an acknowledgment of it. It was almost humorous how much they tried not to see it. Right after his partner walks out, our waitress asks him, ""would you like to order something to eat?"" And after his 'jinx' comment, she comes to us and asks, ""how is everything going?"" I understand it is an uncomfortable situation... But shouldn't someone from management do something? Say something? At least acknowledge how appalling this whole thing is to us if not to him? Maybe it's because he's a regular there (he was loudly telling his partner he goes there everyday when they first sat) or maybe they are just untrained on how to handle situations like this... But either way, our treatment by this man and this establishment left an unsavory taint on the evening and I can't say I'll be returning any time soon."	2star
"aaaa arghhh i am so torn over this place first off, cheers to the ladies up front who were flexible with my reservation for two (me ? ? eating with someone else ??? this feels like a first in many weeks). it seems thursdays at seven arent too bad to try to catch a table here im really pulling my hair out over this one and i know anyone who's reading this probably doesnt care about my reviewing process, but i want to be as honest and earnest and consistent as i have been for my previous reviews and theyre always lengthy so sigh. i'll have to settle with 3 stars. i still hope for the day yelp will let us do halfsies. the menu at pure thai cookhouse seems to me, yes, pure thai cookery. and as much as i would love to tout the title of thai tamer, i am humbly not. i have so much to learn about this amazing cuisine. but i digress. as you can tell from their online menu, expect beyond the pad see ew/kee moa/thai, kra pow gai, basil fried rice. at pure thai you come face to face with a menu that has been translated for easy comprehension just enough to whet the appetite, and then, again, subtitled and deconstructed into simple individual ingredients. but isnt it amazing? words never do justice the complexities of thai, and what you expect is always just a bit shy from the goodness it really is. i love the communal table they sat us at (rings of my experience at il corvo. sighs deeply). the server was probably pretty taken aback by my quick order of som tum (we were both starving), but the server was smiley, others hardworking, bustling about with a focus on delivering piping hot n spicy dishes as efficiently and safely as possible within the super tight confines. after deliberation my friend and i got the ratchaburi crap & pork dry noodles and nakorn-patom duck noodles soup. what beautiful names!! (also still dreaming of the day yelp always emojis in reviews) nothing could pull me away from the lump crab and egg noodles. i needed to find some peace in the latter half of the week. som tum was good--a tangy, sweet, crunchy heap of grated papaya, dried shrimp, chilis, and those precious peanuts. one of the better i've had recently, and thank goodness too, i was about to lose all interest in som tum had it not been for this redeeming experience. that should also read as: has a bad track record with papaya salad, pretty low expectations; always seeking to improve taste crab and pork noodles: in a word, sweet. gah i wish i could better word it but i can't. i dont know what the base of these noodles was but with the roasted pork it was just too sweet. excerpt time: next to us sat a family of five. the eldest boy was sitting diagonally from me, and, midway through our meal he very politely said, ""excuse me, i'm sorry to interrupt your meal, but would you mind telling me what it is you're eating?"" i was so taken aback by his formality, then to humor him and his family, proceeded to talk his ear off on how i felt about each component of the dish, probably a bit too candidly: the noodles are nice, good chew, lump crab absolutely tender, and with all of it together, good, but simply sweet. he seemed a bit surprised/thankful, and then the dad goes, ""ok son, i think i know which one it is on the menu, thanks."" duck noodles soup: my friend got thin rice noodles which was a nice choice for the broth. base also sweet, but i think it was manageable with the cilantro chucked in there. otherwise, something of a heavier beef pho on the tongue, but when first presented, incredibly herbal and medicinal in aroma. my friends and i were a bit stunned when it came out. she looked at me with a confused look and went, ""dude, do you smell han-yak (korean medicine)?"" and now, thinking back, it was reminiscent of our first and only time making little sheep hot pot in our apartment at school. dont ever do that in a poorly ventilated shared college apartment, kids. i only ended up having a bite of my friend's noodle soup since i didnt want to take too much from her experience. all in all, a cool change from the typical thai sprinkled about north nj, even though good god it was so hard to have a nice conversation over the power ballad pop jingles in the back corner haha is it my favorite thai stop-by? no--i have yet to explore enough to say where is. all i know is that, leaving pure thai, i was just roughly whelmed. i wish something shouted at me; theres nothing really ringing in my ear still. would i come back? i dont know. there are so many freakin thai places to try in the city now, i dont know if my wallet will smile on that. but if fate will have it, i'd like to try their rice dishes and more of their appetizers next time.  dont knock it til ya try it! i think pure thai has 1k+ reviews for a reason: a look-see into the wide, wide expanse of thailand's extravagant cuisine, a helping hand into a love affair youve always been waiting for. and so on, so forth."	3star
My expectations were pretty high for Menya Jiro because their ramen was really good at the annual Ramen festival. However, the newly opened store ramen was a far cry from their booth at the Ramen festival. Gone were the piece of salmon, and lettuce. At this store, a standard bowl of ramen only gave you 2 tiny pieces of chasu on top of noodles. Other than the chasu, there were only scallions and bean sprouts. The broth was also pretty bland - not thick or deep at all compared to Totto ramen. I had the spicy broth pork, and was quite disappointed with the broth. Dock one more point because it was expensive too. $14 for a basic bowl, and $15 for the spicy bowl. And the price was before-tax. Good thing this was set up like a fast food place so i didn't tip because it was too expensive.	2star
My mom and I came here after seeing Waitress (phenomenal show, btw) on a Wednesday for the matinee. We managed to get there quickly enough after the show let out to get spots at the bar for dinner. The dining room was completely booked with reservations, so if you have a large group or want to make sure you get a table, call ahead. The bartenders were very attentive and helpful. They recommended the lasagna of the day and I'm so happy I took their recommendation. It was sweet Italian sausage and ground veal with house made pasta. Delicious. They also recommended a wine to compliment the lasagna which was also great. For NYC the price was incredibly reasonable, which is always a plus. Definitely recommend!	5star
Kyclades is THE BEST restaurant in Asoria ! Always fun , great service and delicious food. Apostale is THE Best waiter ever !!	5star
Waited 2 hours for food before I finally walked out. Terrible experience and quite possibly worst customer service I've ever encountered. This was an overdue review from a few months ago.	1star
This place was GREAT. We were greeted by friendly hosts, presumably family members and immediately felt the great vibe the place had. I got the mushroom ravioli special with pistachio sauce and it was excellent. Other members of my party had chicken parm, a special pasta dish and a special salmon dish. All positive reviews ! We had a great experience and will definitely be back	5star
The food and the drinks were great. However, the service was subpar. Our waitress was extremely unfriendly, never checked in with us. It took at least 20 minutes to get a beer and longer to get the check. The service should be fixed because the food does not reflect the poor service.	3star
"First, I want to start off by saying that I enjoyed my meal here. Even though my mouth was on fire half the time, I liked the food. It was fragrant and flavorful. Their famous chicken wings didn't disappoint at all. We got them spicy but it didn't feel that spicy at all - at least not compared to the vermicelli noodles we had. I would've gladly returned just for those wings!  ""So why the one star?"", you ask? Well...there were three of us and we ordered a plate of chicken wings and three dishes with rice each. The dishes don't look like much, but they're pretty filling with only three people. So my cousin took the leftovers home. The next day, when she was eating the leftovers for lunch, she found an earring in her vermicelli noodles. AN EARRING.  You might be asking, ""Was it her own that just fell in?"". No, no it wasn't. It was a cross stud earring. My cousin doesn't wear cross jewelry and neither me or her boyfriend have our ears pierced. It definitely did not come from us. So it had to have came from either the kitchen or our waitress. We're lucky we didn't accidentally swallow it. Super disappointed cause I actually wanted to come back and try more things. But never again."	1star
"I was really, really excited to try Korzo. We live a block away and had been wanting to have brunch at Korzo for a while...  Take my advice. Stay home.  First of all, the portion size and food quality was poor, especially for the price. The latke was described as a ""poor excuse for a latke"". The strip steak was not cooked correctly was small for the $21 price tag. But all of the food came out of the kitchen so late that we were starving enough to wolf it all down. The worst part of our experience was the service, which was inexcusably terrible. Not only did our waiter have almost no idea what was going on, but he didn't seem to know how to communicate at all. I have a food allergy, which I explained to the waiter when he came to take our order. When I ordered my meal, the waiter told me that I wouldn't be able to eat the side that came with it and I would have to have spinach as the side. (I don't really like spinach... so when I asked if there were any other options, he looked like a deer in the headlights. He didn't even answer the question... just looked blankly at me until I agreed to the spinach.) Our food took over 45 minutes to come out of the kitchen and instead of coming to the table to let us know why our food was taking so long... the waiter instead hung out by the heat lamps waiting for our orders to come up. When it did arrive at the table, the waiter hands me my food... with no side. Apparently, the kitchen is out of spinach but instead of COMING TO TELL ME THIS, he just took it upon himself to make the salad that already came with it, a little bigger. When a kitchen runs out of a certain ingredient - it is incumbent upon them to inform their guest. Is that a crazy notion? You can't assume that a substitution is fine with a guest unless you ASK them. ESPECIALLY when we are dealing with food allergies. Also, it's just rude. I'm sorry, I hate rambling narrative-style Yelp Reviews as much as the next guy... but this experience was so specific and so terrible that there was no way I could let this terrible service slide. New York offers thousands of brunches every weekend. Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else for brunch."	1star
Great space and backyard! Had brunch and got the burger with sweet potato fries. Food was good, would be curious to try to non-brunch menu.	3star
My dinner (skirt steak) was ok, but the dessert was delicious! I ordered the pistachio and chocolate semifreddo - one of the best desserts I've ever had. Would definitely order it again-	5star
"The food here is bad! Yes it's a neighborhood spot so I want to support it, but the truth is it taste bad. Many people say the food is Jamaican, but I disagree with that, for $6/$7 I have had delicious Jamaican food from little stores near by. The food is ""Caribbean"", that's about all I can say. The music is Jamaican, the staff is ok, nothing too over the top. Will not go back."	1star
Long wait even on a weeknight but I had a great meal here! Two friends and I shared: + crab cakes + tuna tartare + scallop of the day + sea urchin + fettuccine with clams + ceviche The fettuccine and crab cakes were my favorites, though the scallops were also excellent. Only thing I didn't really care for was the sea urchin - we all agreed that it tasted kind of off. Anyway, overall a wonderful experience and I loved that the menu is all seafood. Free cake for dessert is a nice touch!	4star
Late night bar and take out. Food is whatever not good but when you can't find anything where else serving at 2:30am, ok. Drinks were strong but nothing special. Crowd was annoying young hipsters. There was this one really loud girl that voice hurt my ears.	2star
Terrible service it took forever! We ordered tapas and they were serving us one dish at at time we had to ask for them to bring out a few at once because we all ordered different things... the food was ok not great! Sangria is said to be award winning and it was terrible! Juicy juice.... terrible! Dessert comes and we order two of the same drinks one neat and one on the rocks and the neat was almost empty, granted it's not supposed to be a full glass but not a drop, at least put it in a different glass of you want to give such a small amount! We asked the bartender w the long hair how is this amount correct! Sooooo nasty they are such cocky servers and bar staff!!! Well there's my first 1 star review on yelp terrible	1star
Always great food. But this new manager at night shift was very rude to us. I came here before it gets busy for dinner time bc they don't take reservation. Lunch time meter D told me I was on the list for next table. Then night shift hostess didn't know. Now manger told me we have to wait for table for a while. We sat at the corner of the bar smells like a bleach. My cocktail doesn't taste well in front of that section. Now I have to eat at the bar. Asked them if I can move to the middle of the bar but this manager told me they have to sit 3 ppl but they sat 2 ppl instead of 3. I was a meter D for large restaurant. I know it was their mistakes but manager didn't come to me to apologize. Very disappointed. But great food.	1star
Over the weekend I had plans to do the Holiday Train down on 2nd Avenue, however, the Holiday Special Express broke down to our dismay, leaving us to cancel our dinner reservations in Long Island City. After a few drinks we decided to grab Filipino food and don't ask how derailed we got. My buddy saw the sign that happy hour was still going on. Had no idea Upstate did their happy hour on weekends. We also lucked out and that as we checked how long the wait was they had just cleared a table for four and were immediately ready to seat us. Score! It's a tiny restaurant and normally the wait is at least an hour or so.  Now, don't get me wrong, I love oysters. The only problem is that if I eat a lot of them I have weird stomach issues. It apparently happens to a lot of folks. The first time I had oysters I pretty much had to be airlifted home by my boyfriend at the time and he made me eat half a bottle of tums to make me stop crying. I've been fairly aware of this and have abstained from eating more than 2-3 in one sitting since then. These oysters were freaking delicious. You can eat them plain or with the accompanying trays of horseradish and cocktail sauces with freshly squeezed lemon. But they are good enough on their own. The happy hour special is until 7pm and you get a half dozen oysters of your choice along with any beer on their menu for only $12. We allowed the waiter to do the picking of what he thought was the best. Great deal for probably the best oysters I've had aside from Blue Ribbon. Was I in pain later that night? You betchya. Was it worth it? Darn tooting it was.  Entree I had was the Fettuccine with clams. Really great sauce. It's not like gloppy alfredo sauce but with fresh parmesan and butter. I almost licked the bowl it was so phenomenal. All perfectly paired well with a Fire Island Sea Salt Ale. Additional nice gesture the restaurant offers is complimentary pound cake soaked in I believe whiskey. It was a very nice sweet finish to the night. Definitely a splurge of a meal this weekend but a great deal and worth every penny.	5star
Have visited Ippudo's Tokyo and East Village locations, and this one didn't disappoint. Three of us came here on a Saturday around 3pm and were told there was a 30 minute wait, but we were actually seated after about 10 minutes. The tables are a little tight here, but we were lucky enough to get a booth. In general, it helps to come at an off time since there are no reservations. The pork and/or chicken buns are always must-haves, but this time we shared the fries (perfectly thin with unique seasoning) and the tori karaage (boneless fried chicken with spicy mayo). Both appetizers came out steaming hot, perfectly crispy and delectable. Of course, the main event is the ramen, and Ippudo's broth is the best - deeply flavorful and silky, and you can empty the bowl without feeling weighed down. The karakamen is a favorite (although I don't actually find it very spicy), but you can't go wrong with the classic or really any of the choices. Bonus points for having vegetarian broth options. Whatever you choose, make sure to add a seasoned soft-boiled egg (nitamago) if it doesn't already come with it. Or honestly just get an extra egg, they're so good. Service here was wonderful too. Hype aside, Ippudo never disappoints.	5star
Food is amazing!! Authenthic and original thai and malasian food. Finally found a place that I can say is good!!	5star
Ended up here on a whim Not really impressed. Mediocre food. Service less than mediocre...seated at the smallest table possible. No one ever checked on us...my big thing is refills on water, waiter/waitress should continuously refill water. Had to seek out waitress anytime we need something.	1star
Came here for a quick dinner and drinks before a Yelp event. The food was pretty gross. So gross that we actually only stayed at the Yelp event for 5 minutes because we both felt sick. I think now I hold an extra grudge against them. The pad Thai was edible though they deconstructed it making it hard to get a balance of flavor and the tofu was rubbury. The biggest offender was the salmon fried rice. Avoid at all costs. It's one of the driest things ever. Service was attentive but we felt packed in like sardines at this place.	2star
Great staff, drinks, and unique twist to standard dishes you'll see around town. Staff is amazing, and yes, do expect a bit of a wait for your meal (we went for Sunday early afternoon dinner) -- but I promise the food is worth it! Docking 1 star because portions are smaller than what I would have liked for a dinner meal, but I'm sure would be great as appetizers / casual get-together bite.	4star
One of the best and essential restaurants in Williamsburg. Been here multiple times, but there are 2-3 dishes I always order. The strawberry baby back ribs are incredible, and the bacon doughnuts are probably my favorite dessert in the entire city. That being said, every dish I've ever had there was incredible, not just those two. Those are the two that are insanely good though. Can get a little hectic on the weekends, I'd recommend going on a weeknight when it's less cramped and more chill.	5star
Watered down sangria with a teeny tiny bit of alcohol. Extremely overpriced and the food is mediocre. Not authentic. You can do better	2star
The wait wasn't bad, came here Christmas eve for a quick dinner with my sister. We waited around 10 minutes to be seated. The staff here is busy, I get that, but our server in particular, seemed to be forgetful. After asking three times for iced water (he even brought over our thai iced teas after we asked for the water and placed our orders) I wasn't happy with the constant flagging down servers for something so simple like water. Heck even our appetizers came out before we could get our water. (Hence the two stars, instead of a three) The appetizer we got were Chiang Mai fries, which was served very nicely, and on a plate that resembles a tree trunk. The fries are basically fried vegetables, but the sauces that came with it made this a delicious plate. My sister ordered the original authentic pad thai and I went with the chef's special, crispy papaya pad thai. The original pad thai was all right, the crispy papaya pad thai was something else. Although I'm usually a big advocate for fried food, I just couldn't finish that dish. It's interesting, the texture with the sauce, but in the end, it wasn't for me. The thai iced tea was spectacular though.	2star
I ate at Marmar last week.  The place is fairly new, and needs some tweaking.  The service was terrible.  Ordered several appetizers to share, and a dinner to share.  No sooner the appetizer were served, dinner came 2 minutes later.  Not enough time to enjoy the appetizers. Although the food was tasty and fresh.  I give it three stars for now.	3star
The food was okay, the service was okay and the decor was okay.  Just nothing outstanding.  It seemed crowded so may have been an off day.	3star
hands down the best taco joint i have probably ever been to. it's a bit easy to miss if you're relying on google maps to get here, though. i came here for lunch with a couple of my coworkers. we arrived just before noon and definitely beat the lunch rush. this place can get huge lines in seconds, but that just indicates how worth it the tacos are. they make amazing food and are super efficient. something i would recommend, though, is for the staff to maybe articulate better on how to actually order your food. for noobs like i was, you have to order your food & pay first. then they give you a ticket with your order on it and you can proceed to give it to one of the chefs who will then receive your order and make it for you. just so y'all know.  this place is delicious and definitely worth it, but make sure you beat the rush if you don't like standing in long lines! this place is poppin	5star
Take reservation which is a huge plus in the city. Ordered vanilla French toast, salmon benedict and Jane Benedict. right portion size for girls brunch.	4star
Great food, service and ambiance. I had such a positive experience here. The Mac & cheese was delicious, as was the beet salad. Gorgeous view of the city right outside the front door! Perfect place for a date.	5star
I came here as a group for brunch. For the price, you are definitely paying for the ambience and space above all else. I had the Jane Burger since I was craving something meatier. I'll be honest, I wasn't a fan. It's a solid burger. The patty was on the saltier, fattier side, and the cheese and bacon, while appreciated, didn't help provide the desired balance. Compared to other burgers in NYC, for $18, I'd opt for other burgers. The lightly pickled tomato was pleasant, however. The rosemary fries were unique and well made. White peach Bellini was okay. Had a strange artificial after taste (I was hoping for a more natural puree peach flavor as advertised on the menu). The service was good, with a chattier and friendly Asian waitress among the several who served our table. -- Perhaps I ordered the wrong dish, or my tastes aren't suited to Jane's menu, but I wasn't impressed by my first visit.	3star
"Unfortunately this time around we didn't have a great experience.  I came last year for my birthday and it was pretty good but service failed this year.  The entire experience felt rushed and we kept wondering if perhaps now things are always this crazy.  The 2 stars reflects the crevice not the food which was pretty good. When we were first asked if we were ready to order we were not bc we had just sat down.  When we were ready he was no where to be found and took a long time to ask us for our food.  Thankfully once we ordered it came out pretty quickly. The last 15 min were very rushed since a private party booked the room where we were eating.  We were asked if we wanted coffee. We said YES. We then were asked if we wanted desert. We said YES. We answered yes without knowing the urgency in our departure. Once the coffee and desert came the bill came and the waiter asked me 2x if I had placed my card inside yet with the bill. I answered no bc we had just started our coffee and dessert and didn't get a chance to. He got frazzled and nervous and when I turned around, the party was standing outside watching us eat waiting for us to leave. It was very uncomfortable.   My mom asked ""what's the problem? Are you kicking us out?"" And eventually the waiter upset everyone in my party because he began to say things like ""it's not my fault you can't get mad at me"" and then ""oh well you can complain to the manager, I can go get her"" and ""by the way you arrived 7 minutes late so it's your fault.""  I work in customer service and as an employee I'm trained to do anything and everything to solve the problem before I even bring up the manager and be sure to do everything in my power to alleviate the situation, which he didn't attempt at all. It was all very shocking and uncomfortable.   Once we left the manager (or perhaps asst manager - not sure her role) followed us outside and said apologetically ""would you like to come back in and have a free coffee on us?""  A free coffee? A $300 bill and we get a free coffee? How about making your waiter apologize to us? How about giving us a voucher for a next visit? How about crediting my moms cost of her dish since her birthday was ruined? My mom on her way out told him ""you know, this ruined my birthday, thanks"" and his response was ""your welcome."" In my store we do everything we can to make the clients happy so no one walks out upset enough to leave a bad review. Yet here I am. This review doesn't reflect the great food. But what's good food worth with bad service???"	2star
Really cute place with ok food and nice drinks . Monday bartender was great , today's bartender not so much . Instead of honoring happy hour prices plus up charge for tito's he disregarded the happy hour price all together and then up charged regardless .	3star
Great ambiance but the waiter was very rude and not flexible at all. Very limited menu choices and no customization at all. Drinks were not good either. Overall this is a highly rated but below average restaurant.	1star
So if no stars were an option, that's what I'd give this place. My party of 2 were waiting for our meals for an hour and a half.  Minimal check ins. No complimentary snacks for the wait and no apology.  The waitress claimed that there was a technical difficulty in the kitchen with the tickets.  No idea how the service could be so bad when the restaurant was half empty.	1star
Came here on a Monday night at around 8 pm. I was visiting NY for work and was by myself but still had to wait about 20-30 minutes. I decided to wait because of how many reviews this place has gotten. As a side note, you can order drinks from the bar while you wait to be seated, which is nice. Once I got sat down at the bar, I knew I wanted ramen but looked to see what else I wanted to order. They have specials but I wasn't interested in their special at the time. I also decided to order wings and the pork belly skewer.  The pork belly skewer came out first and it was delicious! Such thick cuts of pork belly cooked to perfection and it didn't feel oily or too much. Then the wings came out which had such a good flavor on it's own, I probably could've just ordered wings all night and been good. Then the ramen came out which really topped off the whole meal. The broth was perfect and went well with all the ingredients in the soup itself.  I'm happy to say I walked away happy and satisfied and definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who is in or visits New York!	5star
Woorijip = Korean Whole Foods. There's a cafeteria style line with hot and cold food bar. Around 20-25 different food selections are available to you to assemble your meal. You weigh your smorgasbord creation at the cashier and pay a price of $8.99 per pound. There are also pre-packaged meals set at different price points. With a plethora of choices, there is something for everyone.	3star
What I had: Short rib sliders: add an extra slider for $5. pass. It was mediocre and I didn't care for this at all. Hoisin sauce wings: sweet and tangy. It was okay. I felt weird asking for hot sauce to eat my wings with. Foie gras over potatoes and a fried egg: it was.... Really rich. I've had foie gras served multiple times before but never fried. It was a little much for me. Bacon donuts: it was not fluffy and amazing but more dense and chewy (not in the good way) Service was great! Just wish the food was as great. Traif did not live up to my expectations.	2star
We ordered 2 meals from the most popular items on the menu and we were so disappointed. The pulled pork and the fried chicken were soggy and cold. The corn bread was soggy and cold. The mac n cheese was so bland. Delivery took an hour and I live .3 miles away. Never again.	1star
ATMOSPHERE: Lots of seating. Open floor plan, with a decent sized bar on the left side when you walk in. There is outdoor seating as well for the summertime. However, every time I have gone there has been a short wait, and the last time I went was only on a Wednesday night!  FOOD: I always get the wings! I believe they are smoked, not fried, so I find them to be, well, smokier in flavor, and am a big fan.  DRINKS: They have happy hour and some drink specials, but full bar. I think I got a wheat beer last time, so didn't venture into anything too crazy, but have had their cocktails before and give a thumbs up.  OVERALL: If you're in the neighborhood and coming back from drinks, stop on in.	3star
Four of us were walking on the upper west side last night looking for a place to eat.  We ended up going to Tessa because its décor was welcoming enough and they could seat us right away.  Our hostess found us a very nice table.  Unfortunately, our chairs were some of the most uncomfortable chairs I have ever experienced in a restaurant.  We ordered appetizers and entrees.  Here's our combined take away:  The kale Caesar salad had no taste, the crispy pork belly was not crispy served in disgusting apple butter that was not very disappointing.  The Tuna Tartar was totally bland and included some funky avocado sorbet that was ghastly.  I had the Long Island Duck with purple barley which was just uneatable.  The duck didn't taste like duck.   We also ordered the Hanger steak which was ok, but covered in overpoweringly pungent Chimichurri.  The one saving grace where the delicious French fries and the custom ketchup. After such a disappointing meal, we did not want to risk ordering desert, mostly because our behind were in too much pain. Finally, this restaurant was so repressively noisy that we could not hear ourselves think.  Overall a very disappointing evening.  I would not recommend eating at Tessa.  There are too many good restaurants in this neighborhood.	1star
On Monday, I dined at Buddakan with loved ones. The experience was phenomenal!! The ambulance is the first thing that hits you; huge ceilings, sleek wall cut outs, huge artwork and decor, and a gigantic deeply sunken dinning room. Chef Zach Taylor wowed us with over 20 course of his finest creations. Our waiter, Kevin, and the services staff could not have been more attentive, entertaining and welcoming. Hands down, best meal I have ever been served. Highly recommended for a top notice NYC dinning experience.	5star
I took the family to Rocco's for dinner. We ordered burritos, nachos and I ordered a taco burger. The burger was cooked as requested but had a sour taste. I ate 1/3 of the burger and no fries and got very sick. The manager walked by and looked at my family's cleaned off plates (their food was great) and my practically untouched meal and completely turn around and started walking away. I called him over and gave him my credit card to pay the meal, I mentioned my dissatisfaction in Rocco's. It didn't turn out as expected. So I left.  (((( buyer beware of the Burgers, go next door to Shake Shack.  )))) * btw, the waitress was great. I also told the manager I would leave negative feedback on yelp. I would have liked to handle this in the store.	1star
Pictures look great, reviews awesome... I travel a ton for work so I rely on yelp. Walked quite a few blocks at 9:45 at night to get to this place only to be told that their times on Yelp is incorrect ... and some knew about it?  Horrible and inconsiderate of peoples time. Now I have 30min to talk around to find something before everything closes  Would've given a 0 star for this one, but thanks to the Yelp God's they default to 1.	1star
Awesome beer selection. The food is OK - I only have snak-type bar food here as I don't care too much for the rest of their food It can get VERY noisy here, so if you're looking to have a conversation this probably isn't the best choice.	3star
Great spot for a pleasing bowl of katsudon on a blustery night. The katsu was moist and tender, and the eggers were also perfectly cooked and almost a little runny which is the goal for these bowls. I also had this pickled vegetable appetizer plate that was kind of forgettable and some of my friends tuna tataki which came with a pleasing amount of heat.	4star
Novel menu with nice ambience. Pork Soup dumplings were different. Main courses were deceptive- large portions, looked great but were really laden with oil so made it very heavy and rich. Large Chinese clientele so must be doing something right...	3star
Today was my second trip to Sweet Chick. My first time was last week in Williamsburg. I enjoyed the food so much I invited a friend to try the one in my old neighborhood of Park Slope. Just like last week we had a good experience, until... We got our checks and when we laid our credit cards down the waitress asked us for I.D.  I know this is very customary but I noticed that no other customers before us was approached or asked for I.D. I found it insulting due to the fact that I witnessed 3 separate guests before us pay by credit card and she didn't ask any of them. My friend and I  were so upset by this we did something I never do, we decided to not leave a tip. I am a known big tipper so for me to not leave one was tough, but necessary.	2star
This was by far the worst lunch experience I had since working in the area (been here a while). Forget that the food was awful (threw that  right in the trash)... the customer service is even worse. I ordered two rolls - one chicken, one beef. So far so good. After waiting for 20+ mins I walked up to them to have them tell me there's no beef. Smh - had I known from the start I wouldn't have ordered it. No information and I would have at least given them another chance had the wait been worth it.  P.s. talked to a coworker who got food poisoning there the last time she ate here. So yes definitely not coming back. I hate leaving negative reviews but wow does this place deserve it	1star
I almost feel bad rating this place because I'm no meat aficionado, but then again, anyone who eats the brisket from here should automatically be considered an expert by affiliation. Brisket is usually pretty fatty and can be chewy, this was everything but that. Literally cut it with our plastic fork and tried both BBQ sauces. Pulled pork and Spare ribs were also excellent. Brisket definitely the hero though. Sides we opted for Queso Mac and Cheese, Collards, Potato salad and Cornbread. Needless to say the two of us walked with doggy bags but well worth it and the vibe is so cool. Grab a local beer while you wait in line to place your order. The line is welcome too because it takes a little while to narrow down what you'd choose from a menu on which everything sounds good. This is the best BBQ we've had in the NY metro area. You must go!!!!	5star
Came here on a Friday night with a girlfriend of mine and got seated in the back terrace with the skylight. Love the interior design of this place - the lights right below the skylight makes the atmosphere of the restaurant a lot more intimate. After we got seated, the waiter brought over a basket of bread and some spreads. The bread was so nice and warm - the butter that they gave us reminded me of the Icelandic butter i had in Iceland, in which it was so good that the proportion of the butter to bread averaged out to be 10:1. Anyways, we both ordered a glass of wine to pair with our dish. I got a sea bass and my friend got a pasta. They were both very delicious. The fish I got had a really crispy skin but the sauce was a bit on the salty side. The presentation was good and the side veggies that came with the fish made the dish very summer appropriate. I am not sure how they made their pasta, but I always say I can't tell the difference between the $2/box of pasta I get from Trader Joe's and the restaurant kind - well, this place certainly proved me wrong! You can still smell and taste a little bit of the freshness of the pasta and I loved it!  Overall I had a good dining experience here and it's good for small family gathering and date night.	4star
"That was a bummer.   A double whami, just tonight: We had ordered an $85 ""special"" lamb for two:  lamb neck or shank. And  We got the strong eye-browed hipster waiter, again.   I thought to ask that we not be put at his tables, again.  But thought surely the place is quiet tonight, we won't end up on his side of the room...sure enough, we did end up there. So we got the waiter that does not serve, and sure enough, he didn't ask, but brought us out the neck.   For $85.  Which was slightly dry and so I asked for more jus and yogurt sauce.   He finally, asked how we were and I commented that he did not ask shank or neck, but just brought what the kitchen had.  And that it was dry.  For $85.   He gave us $10 worth of dessert ""on the house."" It was far, far from $85 worth of braised lamb.   Sad to see the love leave a beloved spot. ;("	2star
My spot for my very hot fried chicken. I can't find that heat anywhere else. My drink of choice is lightening. It has blueberries, bourbon, lemonade, and mint! Bartender is great. She made me a hot toddie that was awesome!	5star
This place is so fn good. So rarely do I find a place that really nails the triumvirate of restaurant excellence: service, atmosphere, and FOOD! A few friends of mine who live in FiDi showed me this place a few months ago and we had an absolute blast. Service: the staff was helpful and funny to boot. We also got a bunch of free shots at the end of our meal! Ambience: not too crowded, but everyone in the place was having a good time. Definitely a place for young professionals after hard day of work to slug a few beers down. The Food: umami-centric! Yeah, it was essentially fancy americanized Chinese food, but every single dish we had was incredibly savory and left you truly wanting for more. I almost didn't want to write this review so that others don't notice this place on Yelp and ruin it, but my Yelptegrity forced my hand. A really fun time; I will be coming back again and again and again.	5star
Awesome. 1 order of chicken pharm. Split between the 2 of us. The waitress warned us not to order anything else. So glad I listened. They sat the two of us so quick. The place was so packed. Awesome dates night in NYC. Thank you Carmine's	5star
- Went there for lunch, Dec 16, given holiday lunches in full swing, not many people. - Quiet place, good for conversation. - Food was usual - Staff was friendly - Good view of Freedom tower and world financial center - reason for 3 star would be limited generic menu for an upscale restaurant	3star
"From the menu and the photos posted on Yelp I really expected more than what I found during my visit to Distilled. First of all, the decor looks unfinished. It's almost as though the owner(s) ran out of money when they were designing it, and just decided to throw up huge gray panels on every wall with only a couple of tiny pictures. The chairs were also really rickety and uncomfortable, and could have used a cushion of some sort.  My boyfriend and I got there before they were seating for dinner, so we opted to relax at the bar with a cocktail while we waited. I ordered the Fine Balance (Ron Zacapa 23, Amaro Averna, Smith & Cross Rum, Orange Oil) and he ordered the Mead Americano (Mead Honey Wine, Carpano Antica, Campari, Grapefruit, Rhubarb Bitters, Charged in House). I felt mine did live up to its name, but was incredibly strong. Maybe I'm just a weakingly, but I couldn't sip it with out making a face. My boyfriend and I both hoped that the sweetness of mead would be leveled out with the bitter additions in the Mead Americano. It definitely was cloying, but was unfortunately so bitter we were barely able to choke it down. Being that it was premixed and individually bottled, I have to wonder who tasted the batch and actually said, ""This is great!"" Bitter is a flavor best administered with subtlety, not with aggression.  The food did help gain the restaurant back some stars. The beef tongue was very tender, and well paired with the mole, and the pate had a nice creamy texture and was just a touch too livery for my taste. The whipped hone that was lightly charred like a marshmallow was a playful touch to the dish, and added a pleasant sweetness. The highlight of the meal, oddly enough, was the complimentary popcorn with ""magic dust."" I'm guessing it's tossed in salt, chili powder, and nutritional yeast, and it's absolutely delicious. We went through 3 bowls in a hurry, and I could have eaten more.  In the end, I left with a buzz and curious if I could recreate the complimentary popcorn at home. Overall, not the worst restaurant experience I've ever had, but not even close to the best."	2star
First time at Ootoya Chelsea with a group of 6. Based on the amazing reviews, we were really looking forward to it. The food was pretty good, nothing spectacular especially given the price. Maybe we didn't order the right dishes? We had about a 20 minute wait before we were seated. Our server was not very helpful, not very friendly and seemed to be in a rush to get our orders out of the way. It also didn't help that we couldn't hear her over the noise in the restaurant. The restaurant itself was beautifully decorated, but was very loud. It was difficult to carry on a conversation with each other. I'm willing to give it another go given the great reviews, maybe it was an off night?	2star
Lots of great Greek food in Astoria but TK is the Mecca of Greek seafood.  Let me start off by saying you WILL wait a while most days and nights of the week to eat here, so don't get all bent out of shape when you get there and have to wait. BUT it's totally worth it so just plan accordingly.  I'll make this review simple and just list the best things to get: Spanakopita Peasant salad Grilled octopus Greek style shrimp Broiled scallops Grilled swordfish  Rice and lemon potatoes	5star
This is my second time coming to Amelie and all I have to say is WOW. My boyfriend and I came here with another couple and we were thoroughly impressed by the food and service yet again and we had so much fun, I had to bump up my previous review another star. The atmosphere here is fun and exciting - perfect for a dinner on a Friday or Saturday night before going out. That is, if you make it out because the waitstaff here are having such a good time that you might never want to leave. We were joking around with our waiter the whole night, and he even gave us a complementary shot. Our party split two bottles of wine, which even my friend who's a bit of a wine snob found extraordinary. The crab cakes might have been some of the best crab cakes I've ever had and the charcuterie board (which we asked our waiter to put together at his discretion) was a great start to the meal. My boyfriend ordered the steak, which I had ordered last time at Amelie and had been disappointed. However, after tasting my boyfriend's again, I thought the dish was great - I must have gotten a piece that had been overzealously seasoned last time. I opted for the scallops special, which was light and delicious. If you are looking for a place to have a great time	5star
We had a wonderful experience at this Asian fusion restaurant! The inside is nicely decorated with trendy accents. It is super busy so be sure to call ahead for a reservation. They have happy hour throughout the restaurant until 7 which was a wonderful surprise. We started off with the pork belly, spring rolls and the sugar cane spare ribs. Every starter was delicious but the pork belly was incredible. They were well seasoned, crispy and super tasty.  For entrees our table ordered the pho, pan fried noodles, pad Thai noodles, fish in clay pot and flank steak dishes. Every dish was awesome. The pho had a wonderful broth, both noodle dishes were excellent as well. The flank steak was tender and oh so flavorful and the fish was fresh and delicious. We loved the restaurant overall. The service was on point and the drinks were strong.	5star
I was so disappointed by brunch at Clover Club, especially after having read such good reviews. We arrived at 11:30 am and there were many open tables.  We ordered three entrees - the chorizo omelette, the Huevos rancheros, and the baked eggs with truffle and leeks. On the side, we had potato latkes with truffle aioli.  The food took an unbelievably long time, especially when the restaurant was not even remotely full. It eventually arrived after 40 minutes. I broke into my baked eggs and they were rock hard! I was so disappointed-all I wanted was runny soft eggs and I had waited so long for nothing.  Our waitress was really very nice and took them back to the kitchen, got me a new order and took the dish off our bill. I really appreciate that so much. Sadly, it took about 30 minutes for my re-made eggs to arrive. By this time of course everyone else was long done with their own plates and itching to go. Just an unfortunate experience. And incredibly expensive! I would not come for brunch again but I appreciate how nice they were about the mishap.	2star
I don't want to review this place only because I feel like my words won't do L'Artusi justice. I went to another Epicurean group restaurant, L'Apicio, a few years back for Valentine's Day and remember loving the food so this restaurant has been on my hit-list for quite sometime. I made a reservation exactly a month in advance for my 21st birthday (you don't have to make a reservation THAT early, I just got too excited. Also, you can get prime right-in-front-of-kitchen seating with a 5:30 walk-in) and honestly, coming from a person who goes out to eat way too often, this is the best restaurant I have ever had the privilege to eat at. Currently waiting for my next big paycheck to go back. Service: STELLAR. So sweet, knowledgeable, and friendly. My boyfriend told our waiter that we were celebrating my 21st birthday, and the staff was more than accommodating. I was recommended an amazing bottle of red (Barbera D'Alba 2013) wine for a steal price, and given a complimentary pasta dish (absolutely delicious) from the chef and a raspberry sorbet with a candle during dessert. Appetizers: Roasted Mushrooms (came with a fried egg on top) - I'm drooling trying to think about and describe this dish at the same time. Umm, let's just say amazing and my favorite appetizer ever. Cooked to perfection-- the thinly-sliced ricotta + runny yolk really compliments the meatiness of the mushrooms + pancetta. Wagyu Beef Tartare (special of the day) - I'm a big seafood tartare person, but never tried beef tartare before, so this was a treat. First of all, they give you two really generous slices of crisp toast with a hefty layer of beef tartare on top. Each bite was so good, I never wanted it to end. Great crunch on the bread and the tartare was PACKED with flavor. Main: Tagliatelle - Best I've ever had, but I'm assuming whatever pasta dish I get here I'd say the same exact thing. One of L'Artusi's signature dishes, according to the recommendations from our waiter. What distinguishes this dish from other bolognese pastas is that they use a white sauce as opposed to traditional tomato sauce. Really enhances the flavor of the meat! Branzino Filet - Crisp. Fresh. Generous portion. An authentic Italian fish plate that's simple yet beautiful executed. Dessert: Finally. The review we've all been waiting for, or at least the section that I'm really excited to write about. I'd like to preface this by saying I have the biggest sweet-tooth and am a dessert-hunting savage, and again, L'Artusi lives up to every hype there ever is/was. Olive Oil Cake - If I could eat this for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and as a snack in-between, I truly would. This cake is so simple yet so rich with flavor that I didn't know what to do with myself. Super moist cake (and only for food I say this word is acceptable/appropriate to use) and the mousse on the side is like this buttery, salty concoction that compliments so well... ugh.  Hazelnut Chocolate Torta - Another popular and recommended dish. If you love chocolate and don't have a nut allergy, you totally need to get this. Really, REALLY yummy with a nice crunch from the praline layer on the bottom of the cake. Loved the textures of this dessert!	5star
Changed dessert menu - No more baked Alaska.  Service was attentive and food was good. We found street parking - had an early dinner.	4star
"Ok, I am sorry to write this review because I thought I would be giving this place at least 4 stars. I lived in the Lower East Side my entire life, yes 30+ years and I have never been to this place or heard of it until recently. I know the current owner who is in his 30/40s has been marketing this place well recently, so kudos to him! As a dim sum lover, this place ranks low for food quality and on par for service. We went on a Wednesday night, so the line was not especially long. We waited about 10 mins before getting seated. Once seated, I took a look around, and this place was filled with non-Asians, which I didn't think much of until I started eating. I order the sticky rice, the plain rice rolls, shrimp rice roll, their Original ""OG"" Roll, Turnip Cake and Pan-fried Dumplings from the dim sum menu. Also ordered their Egg-Fried rice and Chinese Broccoli. Of all of this, their turnip cake was the best and their OG roll was the worst. The rest of was okay, but definitely below standard of an authentic dim sum restaurant.  Their turnip cake boosts a good amount of turnip and flour balance. It is pan-fried nicely on both side, but a bit on the greasy side.  I do not know who created the OG roll, but it was just flour dough with canned corned and some weird chicken based sauce. A fast food Chinese restaurant's egg roll tastes much better.  The service was really poor. The guys and gals just throws your meal by the edge of the table and walks always. It appears that they cook everything in batches, so all the fried rice comes out and its distributed. Great operation. I also ordered Oolong tea but it never came, which we didn't care to follow up after tasting our food. Most other dim sum/Chinese restaurants offer tea for free.  Overall, if you are a fool to pay these prices, then props to you. If you want authentic dim sum, take a pass and find another place. Again, this place have two things that is going for them, 1) great management that promotes this place in all the local media and 2) located in a unique alley -- that was once home to gangs and drugs.  I also would give a worthy mention that their décor was unique and the diner feel was nice. I am rating this place for food and service and it is well below par."	1star
Read reviews about racial profiling and sub par service and was skeptical to try it, but it led up to expectations... food was pretty good, but from the moment my boyfriend and I walked in we were brushed aside- the host walked by us to seat the man behind us in a tux (we had been waiting patiently for 15 minutes). After we sat down the waitress was slightly rude but I didn't think much of it; but after we ordered I noticed the waitress kindly explaining all the specials to the table next to us when we had not heard a single special. I would have loved to order the duck special, but was never given the chance. I said something to the waitress, but was not taken very seriously. Such a disappointment for a restaurant that could have potential. Tip: try Rucola or Aurora for similar atmosphere, better ingredients, and far better trained staff!!	1star
"The pizza ""Bianca"" is so good! It has two different cheeses, mozzarella and ricotta. The ricotta cheese is really good and fresh. I decided to just add arugula as a topping to keep it simple; and I'm trying to eat a little healthier... It's like eating a salad on an edible plate. I think I'll be ordering this pizza again and just try different toppings because the ricotta cheese is so good. I think I'm going to want ricotta cheese on every pizza from now on. The dough was also soft and not chewy. It was light and not too thin and not too thick. I usually don't eat the crust but I did this time. Delivery was quick, and I think the pizza was $20. Can't wait to re-order with different toppings and try different pizzas. I definitely recommend this place if you're in the neighborhood."	4star
To me this is the original Grimaldi pizzeria, even though it has been renamed to Juliana's. As a pizza connoisseur, I can tell you that this is fantastic brick oven pizza, no matter what toppings you order. Pies are huge (medium is plenty for 2 hungry adults). The selection of wines is very nice. What I found silly is that they artificially maintain the line outside. When we were seated inside, there were plenty of available tables, yet there was still a line outside. :)	4star
When my friend Jimmy L suggested this restaurant, I was excited to try it. A husband and wife team running a small business and making home cooked meals really touched me. The Good: + Food entrees have a creative spin such as the steak and eggs and fish n chips (I say creative in a non conventional way; see photos). + Wise use of a small space with a comfortable feel. + The bathroom (see photos). The toilet paper dispenser is cool. The Bad: - Restaurant is small so make sure to make reservations. - Red Hook is far way for me to travel. - Dumplings were ok, but not something to boast about. The Ugly: -- In professional wrestling terms, the Good Fork is really a jobber with a good gimmick. There is no substance. The food is good but its not transcendent for me (average at best) to return to Red Hook again. IFHTP 1	3star
"Food: slightly above average only because (only) certain dishes are so very delicious. Service: comes with a large side of attitude There are so many great restaurants in the West Village that are welcoming and of course offer excellent food; we typically (happily) eat at the same restaurants every few weeks.  With the recent closing of a favorite restaurant (Monument Lane), hubby and I are on the hunt to fill the spot.  I thought Extra Virgin could be the one, after a positive first experience where carnivore husband went bananas over the turkey burger.    On our second attempt to visit the restaurant, I made a reservation for 2 on OpenTable, specifying that we wanted a table by the window as it was a sunny day.  When I got there, we saw at least one table by the window.  The host, however, refused to seat us at an available table by the window. The reason he cited did not make sense and he basically said to either take a table at the back of the restaurant, or else.  OK, fine, so we left and went to another place nearby, where they had no problems giving me a table by the window and the food was at least as good as Extra Virgin.  Then I received an email from OpenTable saying that I was a no show for this reservation.  I popped back to Extra Virgin after my pleasant meal at the other restaurant and thought to clear this up.  When I got Extra Virgin, there was a line of people waiting to be seated, but no host or hostess in sight.  I asked the bartender if I can speak to the manager and had to wait for someone.  The manager came out eventually, and defended her colleague in not changing the reservation to ""cancelled"" after I declined his not-so-gracious offer to seat us at the back of the restaurant when tables were available by the window.  Due to consideration for diners who are waiting patiently to be seated, I decided not to engage further with the manager.   Not travel worthy, but not friendly enough to be a neighborhood joint."	2star
"If you are with a group of businessmen or more cookie cutter/homogenous crowd, you should not read this review since you will most definitely have a decent experience, but if you plan to go here with a less homogenous group along with people of color and non-businessmen type I would definitely consider going someplace else.   Basically, If i could give this place 0 stars because of the racist pricks that worked there, I would. Maybe it was a bad night and the eastern European, white female server and supposed Irish accented ""owner""  felt threatened by a group of Pakistani and Iranian - Americans too close to the financial district. Or maybe they assumed we were part of the occupy wall street protest across the street (which we did participate). REGARDLESS, we came into a bar with open tables all over the place and a back room with a few people hanging out.   But when I came in with my friend to meet up with his friends on a Friday, we sat down and were told to move and that the space was reserved.  We moved someplace else and then the server told us with an attitude the same thing instead of just directing us to a non-""reserved"" table.  We stayed for a few minutes at the table anyways to finish our drinks so that we could leave, because they kept moving us around the empty place.  But the server then went to her boss or the supposed ""owner"" and talked to him about us (im assuming) and he came over and claimed that the third place we were sitting was also reserved even when most of  the place was empty. He repeated that the space was reserved then instead of offering us another table, he proceeded to go on a tirade and claim that he is not a racist, even though none of us said anything to that respect. But by making that statement, he clearly showed his intentions and guilt of being racist.   Of course, I was the most vocal about the issue and argued with him about why it looks suspect to me when other people around us were at other tables and there was a nearly empty backroom and a nearly empty front, yet he wanted us to essentially leave or not sit at a table.  Well, after we had a heated chat, where he asked me why my friends didn't speak up for themselves.  He said I needed to leave. Apparently,  he couldn't handle the thought of a woman arguing with him instead of the guys I was with, but he said that my friends could stay. Aside from the fact that he was ignorant and arrogant to assume that we would continue drinking and supporting ""his"" racist establishment, we were planning to leave anyways because of their BS and because we were only going to be there for one drink. He changed his mind a few minutes later and said that not just me but everyone needs to leave. (The exchange I had with the supposed owner was a lot more detail, but the gist is in this review.) It was my 1st and last time here.  There are hundreds of cool bars and restaurants to go to in NYC. It is not even worth stepping in here if you have a hunch that this may happen to you.  We ended up at a nice irish pub down the street a few blocks were the booze was cheap and the servers and bartenders were normal.   Negative10 for SERVICE 0 for drinks cuz I wasn't served and the bartender ignored me 4 for ambiance (because it was big and a decent space)"	1star
Usually my favorite noodle restaurant in Chinatown but this Sunday, every dish we ordered was so salty we could barely eat it. Has the chef changed? The tiger salad was inedible it was so salty. We asked to have the salad remade but the staff was rude and when they did finally do it there was no improvement. We will try it one more time because I used to love this noodle place and if it improves we can change this review. So unfortunate!	1star
The food was terrible but the service was worst. As soon as we walked in the waitress started telling us everything we couldn't  do at the restaurant and apparently one of those things was order. When she finally came by 20 minutes later we were blocks of ice because  there was no heat. We placed our order and waited for our drinks. And waited and waited. Finally the food came out. The waitress had gotten one of the orders wrong but rather than wait longer,y friend juat ate what ahe got. My eggs benedict were cold, and bland. The French fries were soggy and greasy. Eat ANYWHERE  else in boerum hill!	1star
"This was THE most horrible experience my husband have ever had. We made reservations for this place  few weeks in advance for my birthday. When we got to the place they didn't ask us what we were celebrating but asked all the tables around us if they were celebrating anything. We asked to sit at the table by the window as the table was empty with no ""reserved"" sign, and they said no. 20 min later they moved a DIFFERENT party who was across from us to that same table we requested after they had ordered their food. Who does that? The food was not good at all. My husband and I wanted to leave. Due to $125 CANCELATION FEE EACH we decided to stay and pay the $130 FIXED PRICE MEAL. I was extremely disappointed on how they treated us and the food quality. If I could request a refund I would."	1star
If you love wine, or want to try a bunch of different wines at a relatively reasonable price, then I highly recommend you make your way to Amelie. This place is perfect for date night, girls night, or perfect for anyone looking for a quick drink. I highly suggest making a reservation, as this place gets packed easily. There's plenty of seats at the bar and high top tables alongside the bar. For something more cozy and relaxed there's plenty of tables towards the back (Make a reservation!!) My friend and I shared all of their crostini's, which were delicious BTW. Sadly, I wasn't too happy with their steak tartare. Presentation was beautiful but it was a little too sweet for my taste.  Overall I would definitely return and would definitely recommend this place. CHECK this place OUT if you're in the West Village. You'll thank me later...	5star
Insane food. Immpecable service. This place is an institution and for good reason.  Drinks were incredible. The Brooklyn green is a must try.  We had Hannah as our server and she crushed it.  Go here for a special occasion. Or not. You'll be happy either way.	5star
Must stop by when you're in the area! Spectacular, authentic family trattoria. Food like my Nana use to make. Gnocchi alla Boscaiola and Veal Saltimbocca delectable. We were a family gathering of 24....the family style appetizers were mouth watering and abundant. The staff were warm, friendly, beyond efficient and anticipated every need. Thanks, Alfonso, for creating a special menu for our event. Thanks, Marco, for taking such good care of us. Highly recommend. We felt like family!	5star
Pretty good. Didn't have any flaws I disliked about it. The bread complimented the lobster exquisitely and I would definitely come back again for these lobster rolls!	4star
Good:  Mojitos were excellent.  They serve a lot of Jerk Chicken (8pcs) and they're not scant with the seasoning.  Sweet plantains were tasty.  Servers were very attentive and polite Bad:  Nothing particularly special about their entrees.  The ones we ordered (steak, pulled pork / steak?, chicharones) were a bit overseasoned (too salty).  Price was way too much.  Not a very good place to dine in if you're looking for value for your money *Read that their lunch specials are way more affordable so might need to try that next time... if we ever decide to eat here again	3star
Unfortunately the service has gone downhill here. I came into tonight for a quick burger and beer but was just told the place is closing. Bad.	2star
Came for Sunday brunch for 4 - we had a late reservation at 230p. The restaurant is actually quite large and has a fun vibe. I got the Pollo Ranchero, which was mediocre. What people really come here for is the unlimited sangria refills - Havana Banana is the best sangria as it's light, so it is easy to consume. Make sure you double check with your waiter when last call is though - our waiter came to us frequently to ask if we wanted more sangria, but did not actually tell us when last call was.. this was pretty unfortunate.  Ah well, we were all very tipsy at the end of the meal, made our way to National History Museum afterward and stumbled around. Good times.	4star
"I'm from South Carolina, so I have high standards for bbq. Hometown hit the spot. Good bbq is SO hard to find in NYC, so after this place kept popping up on foodie blogs and such, I put it on my list of places to try. My boyfriend and I were planning a trip to Ikea today, so it was the perfect time to go to Hometown for lunch!  It's a very spacious restaurant, with two large seating areas, two bars, and a stage for live music in one of them.  The line moves super quickly. You give the first person your meat order, and the second person serves up the sides and rings you up. Both of the people we interacted with were friendly and efficient. Our total was about $40 for the pulled pork sandwich, brisket sandwich, medium side of mac and cheese, and medium side of collard greens.  Both of the sandwiches had excellent flavor! They were super juicy and the meat was very tender. I liked the pulled pork better because it had ""hometown slaw"" on it and a bolder flavor. They really didn't need any extra sauce or anything though. They have two types of sauce-one is a bit spicy and the other is sweet. The bread on each was great too, and the meat didn't make it soggy.  The sides were amazing. The mac and cheese had roasted chiles in it and a distinct, delicious flavor. The texture was perfect-not overly saturated with melted cheese, but not hard and dry either. The collard greens were so full of flavor! They had smoked pork shoulder bits in them. I've eaten a lot of mac and cheese and collard greens, and these were definitely some of the best I've had.  Don't let the trip to Red Hook deter you-it's an easy walk from the F and G trains, and lots of other great bars and restaurants in the area!"	5star
Cool bar area, reasonably priced beers but I honestly expected a lot more from this place. I guess I set the bar high because it is located so close to me and so desperately wanted to be a regular  But the food is ok and rather expensive, and every time I wonder why I don't go there as often as I thought I would I just eat there again and am reminded I definitely do not want to deter anyone from going there with this review. I think that they have a wide following and the staff is very nice. I personally like it more for drinking than eating  I will be back and I will find something on the menu that will keep me coming back	3star
"Came here for a spur of the moment karaoke fix with my coworkers and while I had a great time, there are definitely better places in the city. It's located on the 5th floor of a building that looks like an office building from the outside. Once you get off the elevator, you see the restaurant seating and then the karaoke rooms are off to the back. The small 10person room was $80/hr and the bigger one was a little over $100 I believe. Tad bit expensive in my opinion, especially since we had issues with the mics when we first got there. However, once that was fixed it was a fun karaoke experience.  I did find their selection pretty limited to other places I've gone, they had no biggie or lauryn hill (What?!). Also, the book was mostly Korean with limited ""pop"" selection in the back. I really hope they upgrade the music and also add some more material. The food was the best part, specifically the soy garlic wings.  Overall, I prob would skip this place for karaoke but come back and eat wings in the dining area"	3star
Another thing I wanted to eat while in NY was proper soul food. I did a little research and although Marcus Samuelsson's Redbird was tempting, I wanted something more old school. Amy Ruth's popped up, so on this day, we took an Uber from our hotel in Central Park up to Harlem. We arrived just as it started getting dark. There were already many people inside the restaurant. The front dining room was about full, so we opted to sit in the back room. We ordered a bunch of things to share. Fried Chicken -- really moist on the inside and juicy! The skin was perfectly crispy too. I don't think I can eat at Roscoe's ever again. Fried Whiting -- even better than the chicken. The corn meal coating was crispy and when you break into the fish, it was flaky and steaming hot. We had a bunch of sides to share: collard greens, red beans and rice (I like that it was dry and not wet and mushy), black eyed peas, green beans (a little tasteless). It was rather tasty and I won't hesitate to come back again when craving soul food.	4star
"UPDATE! This place... I do not recommend it. The server (""bartender"") Edward was the rudest staff I've ever met and I work in a restaurant too! I expected more from this place. As a fellow yelper, I read what others said before making my way over. I came in and I was impressed with the beauty of the restaurant. I was definitely in love with the ambiance and couldn't wait to try the food. We were taken to a small table and asked if we could sit at the next table or even the patio.  Edward said he has to check the screen and then declined to do so. Hey no problem, but turns out we were allowed to sit at the patio with no problem! Some one else seated us outside so I guess he was irritated that other staff members did not acknowledge him that outside seating was permitted and he decided to take it out on two girls? So we sat at the patio, turns out, he was our server. His attitude towards us was already rude - we were ticked off. If you're not happy, why bring our mood down? I think you can see the picture here. He kept up that attitude when he served us. It was the start of the worst dinner service. I ordered 1 xiao long bao, and he did not inform us that he had no idea what we meant. Things took a complicated turn and when I confirmed the order he proceeded to argue about how how he isn't Asian and that He is Korean. (Literally face palm). My expression was that as a server who works there, at least know the menu and the Chinese name! It is a Chinese restaurant! He should at least know the Chinese name of the most popular dumpling in New York! He proceeded to give me more attitude and I felt almost belittled by him. At this time, I tried to calm the situation by being a little light hearted and making a joke with him but he just kept being rude. My friend came shortly to change the order and I felt that he was frustrated with us. There was Chinese words on the menu and we were just reiterating it. He just kept up with his attitude and truth be told, I felt like leaving. There's more to the story but to cut straight to the point, we asked for another server and a strong drink, I definitely lost my appetite for this place and honestly, I will not EVER return. I have an extremely sour taste for this place. I asked one of the staff if Edward was new as I would be able to understand and let my anger subside with a reasonable explanation as to why we had to be given a hard time over something small. Turns out, he has been there for a while and even the staff responded that it was just Edward's personality and they understood what I meant. Why would a restaurant keep him when he drives customers away with a bad mood. Ling was the new server that took over so I feel a little better but once you have a strong discomfort at your local Asian hot spot- your mood is highly disappointed. Food itself was alright and was not enticing. The crystal shrimp dumplings was very sticky (stuck to my chopsticks and plate). I could not taste much. The xlb was probably much better but nothing curb my appetite anymore. My friend was also in the same boat- disappointed. China blue, you have such a beautiful restaurant and such an amazing location but to be ruined by a bad apple..... not sure why.  This place definitely made an impression on me- a sour one. UPDATE: the problem was not about the language as I speak English as well. It was about the server's attitude. See, the name of the dumpling was only a small part of the problem but it was the way the server handled the situation! Please try and understand from our side of the story as well! How would you feel if you pointed out the order and your server came to you with and angry personality and belittle you? That's the problem. I work in the restaurant industry too and no matter how upset I get with my customers, I have always tried to make the best out of every situation by being polite and nice."	1star
This place was always on my list before I moved to NY. It used to be a good spot for friends reunion or quick dinner. Couple days ago, when my friend and I decided to have some quality food without heavy sauces in the area, we picked this long time loved BBQ place. And it completely ruin our expectations. Here it goes. My friend were there around 5:20pm, before they opened. So she got a seat immediately. When the waiter knew I will be late around 10mins, they gave her two choices. Either seat over there and finish our dinner in one hour, or wait for me until I am there. My friend decided to pick the first option. That's how and where the nightmare begun.  After I left my office and arrived there on time, they gave us the menus and asked what we'd like to have without enough time to go through the menus. Then the dishes came in a really slow way, however, they intended to let us finish those dishes quickly. Literally checked our table in every 3mins. Yes, every. It's totally unpleasant and uncomfortable. My friend and me definitely knew we have to finish the meal and forward the table to the other party, but I don't think check every 3mins after a long waiting dish comes is a professional way to deal the restaurant business.  Lucky enough, we were able to finish our meal within the frame of time. Then it comes to get our check. They gave us the check when we were still working on our dessert. Since there were 20mins left, we thought at least we could finish our last part of this meal in a good way. No. Totally wrong. They came back and checked whether we put our cards or not..... Besides all the bad services, the food is not ok as well. The chicken skin skewers are not fully cooked as before. The signature salad is not dressing at all so we have to ask the dressing. The inside of mushroom skewers are still raw. The $10 each beef skewers are tooooo well done, tasted like a bad cooked chicken breast. The beef tongue are way TOO fresh it means they didn't season and cook in a right way.  Overall, this was definitely a horrible experience I could ever expect. This place used to my to go place for four years. My friend also a big fan of this place after we moved to NY two years ago. I didn't write anything about it before as I'd like to keep this secret but popular spot for my friends and myself (selfish way lol). However, this time visiting gave me a totally negative impression from the food and service both sides. They may change the management team, they may change the chefs, it doesn't matter for any client. The only thing matters is they have to keep their customers happy and respect them because the food also the service. They failed both.   PS: Due to we ate those not proper cooked food in a harsh way, my friend and me felt uncomfortable these days.	1star
Don't be discouraged by the waiting crowd outside the door - authentic ramen and sizzling don are worth your wait.  I came here with a friend around 6:30PM and had to wait around 15min to get seated because of the gathering crowd - it is obviously a popular spot in the neighborhood. We got a tsukemen (dipping noodle) and a chasiu bap (chasiu korean hot stone rice with Chinese honey glazed pork) along with kanuni bun and pickled napa cabbage: 1) Tsukemen is really good! The serving is big - comes with dry noodle and dipping soup - rich tonkatsu soup. Noodle is chewy and soup is rich and thick, I've tried ones in Japan and this one is as close as it can be!  2) Chasiu bap is a fusion creation between Chinese, Japanese and Korean cuisine. It came as rice with chasiu in a sizzling stone bowl and server will pour soy sauce in the bowl to further cook with the rice. Unlike some bimbimbap I had before which tend to always be overcooked, this one was just right in terms of heat and the tastes of everything (veggie, meat and soy sauce) blend in together really well. 3) Kakuni bun - standard, good appetizer to start the feast. 4) Napa cabbage - a fusion between Korean kimchi and Japanese bonito flake. Very refreshing but a bit too spicy with the yellow mustard... The service is also decent - despite the busy time, the server kept giving us water and responded very quickly upon our request.  Like other ramen place, this place doesn't squander space so be ready to restrain yourself and your belongings in a very small area. This place doesn't take reservation so come early to secure your spot!	4star
I completely agree that this place is overrated! The pizza was not at all worth the price or the raving reviews that people give it! I have eaten way better pizza than this! The pizza crust tasted undercooked and it was just a huge mess of disappointment. Trust me I don't know what people are raving about but please go else's where! Pizza in Italy taste better than this!	1star
This little gastropub is tucked away in the side streets of Sunnyside. While this place is easily missed their little lights outside will draw you in.  The bartenders and waitstaff at this place will invite in like an old friend inviting you to his backyard party -- it's a laid back atmosphere with good food, drinks, and vibes. Feel free to ask one of the bartenders to recommend a drink, they'll be happy to tell you their story. Did I mention this is an educational gastropub? So, come here with an open mind and empty belly.  If you're here to nibble and have a few drinks, try their truffle fries. If you're hungry and want something to hold you down for the day get their Alcove Burger it comes with an adorable  quail egg. If you want something to share, well tacos are sharable right? This place understands the subtleties of sweet, salty, fat, and gooey, so bring your tastebud too! Tip: Don't come with a fur coat 'cause their kitchen smoke tends to float up to the dining and bar area. You'll have to febreze your furry friend the day after but it's worth it.  Bon Appetit!	5star
The space is beautiful. The service is was horrendous and the food is meh. Out of everything we ordered the chive cake was the only thing worth eating. I can get that at Corthaiyou along with great food and service. Mondayoff is just not worth the time or money.	2star
Got seated next to the kitchen after the hostess said it was booked up it was uncomfortably hot so I was about to leave when the waiter showed up.  I told him it's too hot and I was going to leave and he's like no no no pleas stay I'll move you so we wait and then the hostess comes 10 mins later like no we're not moving you which was fine like I just wanted to leave anyways  So we left then the manager comes and chases us out and was like no let's seat you somewhere else so we're like okay fine. Sits us at the bar it's okay then they squish another person in so it's uncomfortable and the girl next to me has her hair in my food and every time I tried to cut something or eat we'd bump elbows.  I wish I just left when I had the chance--- and didn't eat the woman's hair. It just seemed weird that she wanted us to stay, sat us, then added more people to the point where we all were very uncomfortably squished. Anything for an extra dollar right? Ps did I mention it was 6 30 pm and the place at 70% capacity.	1star
"This place is laughable. I ordered the ribeye, which looked like a chef from ""Worst Cooks in America"" boiled it in a pan and forgot seasoning. Fries were crinkle cut, Oida at best. Shockingly disappointed."	1star
Had dinner there last night, the place is definitely interesting, love the decorations.  Food is just alright, guess it is been overrated. And the hostess was cold and snooty, I asked her for the direction of the restroom, she rolled her eyes and pointed it to me.	3star
"False advertisement on ""all you can eat mussels"". Sign says ""all day monday"" but it's only available until 7pm (at the bar). I guess it was a blessing in disguise because I ended up ordering the regular mussels and it was overcooked, old and not good. Definitely would not have had a second plate. Friend ordered gnocchi and it was overly sour. Food is not worth the price!"	2star
Great spot found on July 4th! I live in Manhattan so it was friends that guided me here and I'm happy the did. The food was amazing and the staff were super sweet! I'd eat a truck load of truffle fries given half the chance!! We did apps and burritos and everything was yum and their selection of beers was great. I don't drink beer so had a cider. Magners! Hooray! If you're out sunnyside way I'd highly recommend checking this cute little place out.	5star
Food was really over priced. The portions were much smaller than I expected and they removed the dark lighting they had a few years ago.  I had decided to close a night of drinking here, but had total regrets after the prices were rape and the food was mediocre. I guess this is location is a lot more family oriented now and attracts less of a hip crowd. The music was set at an all time low which was so hard to hear and it was most likely k-pop.	3star
With all the hype about this place (saw it on 2 different food shows in last week) I was expecting to be mind blown, suffice to say mind is still quite intact. Now I may be just a white boy but Im a white boy thats been eating dim sum since I could walk. Eating at Golden Palace and the other big one, unicorn something. Anyway I know my dim sum and this was average at best dim sum.  The place is pretty cool looking with its 50s decor but that quickly fades as you look around and see not a single Asian person (non employees) but a bunch of bearded grubby looking 20 something hipsters who of course INVENTED dim sum so they know.     The service was gruff ( Move your bag! was barked at Alex so they could squeeze yet another skinny jean wearer next to her) they brought our dessert sesame taro balls out first which made no sense. As for the good the crab claw was very good, when my sister and I were little this was one of our favorite things, like a crab lollipop. The version here was done very well. The lil garlic spare ribs were also very good but I can get the same ones from a spot in my hood (Bensonhurst) for a buck. Same goes for the Pork Bao which in my opinion the one here was too heavy. Same goes for the Har Gao which usually has this delicate casing, the one here was way too thick and the shrimp inside wasnt as sweet as it usually is. The Shu Mai also was just average. The stuffed eggplant was too oily and bland. The 20 yr old tea was good. The prices are way too much for dim sum but when your clientelle is tourists and hipsters burning daddys allowance I guess its fine. If youre going to go for history (pell and Doyers is such an interesting block) go here but a better touristy Dim Sum spot is Dim Sum Go GO.	2star
For the price point - one would have higher expectations of the quality and selection.  Maybe it's one of those - where we didn't order the right items.   Salmon sashimi Lure maki roll  Crispy calamari Chilled seafood salad Spicy tuna on crunchy rice Branzino with cous cous Think we were craving Japanese - hence most the above item.  Their sushi items definitely were the lowlights of our meal.  It was average at best and PRICEY.   The crispy calamari was overly crispy coated in a thick tangy mild spicy barbeque spice sauce.  The best part of the meal was the branzino - nicely cooked and well seasoned.  The server was thoughtful to split the entrée for us (we didn't ask).  The server assistants were top notched - delivering the dishes, clearing and making sure our water glass were always filled.	3star
From the food to the revitalizing interior design, Atrium is the perfect spot for an energizing brunch.  Deviled Eggs - relish,​ bacon & smoked paprika, would order again Cobb Salad - it's a Cobb Salad, well-made Ricotta Crostini - drizzled with balsamic and honey, topped with prosciutto, definitely the star of the meal Umph, delicious.	5star
So whoever goes to this place and say this is the best spanish food or sangria they ever had no.1 never been in spain or had regular or semi regular spanish food and sangria. Im giving it 2 stars because the place its indeed pretty. And smells like the beautiful imported flowers they have there. So you will have a beautiful candle light dinner that you wont enjoy. Thats the main reason why I dont trust reviews here no more. Like you are more impressed with how the food or place looks than service or if THE ACTUAL FOOD  its even good. Idk about you but since I still go to restaurants to eat. This was a huge dissapointment. First off their sangria was a red wine with liquor. And not even apple liquor which is the one that will give it the taste of sangria. So it tasted like a bad old vinegared wine. I couldnt finish it no matter how badly I wanted a drink that night. I ordered the pulpo con palomitas. It was at most average. Very well presented but not good. It only tasted like salt. We ordered the paella. Which was a platter of yellow rice(not even made with azafran that gives the paella it typical taste) and all it had was chicken and fish. They give you 2 pieces of shrimp and squid with it... Lol 2 pieces. And the place was ridiculously expensive also. THIS WAS THE WORST PAELLA I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. but you can feel free of go and try it by yourself if you feeling like expending some hundred dollars in food you'll hate.	2star
Brussel sprouts and chicken sandwich were good, veggie burger was awful.  It had no flavor and was falling apart.  Then the side salad had no dressing on it.  I'd come back and try other things because it's a cute place and prices are very reasonable, but they should work on that recipe.	3star
I am sorry to say that I did not have a good time here. Perhaps it was an off night but too many things misaligned, resulting in a negative experience. Understandably, the restaurant was busy as it's the week before Christmas and was doing their best to seat and serve everyone promptly. That being said, the maitre-d' was very brusque and unfriendly. We felt like cattle being herded into a corner. The table we were placed at was claustrophobic, in a cramped corner--so much so that we had to move the table to maneuver and sit down (and we're average sized people). It was physically uncomfortable. The server was distracted and less than attentive.  All of this could have been made up for by stunning food. I'm sad to say that the food below average. It came out shockingly fast--almost too fast, like they were rushing. And it was evident when we tasted the food that it had indeed been rushed--the Pappardelle ragout was beyond al dente--it was mostly raw, stiff, and stuck in a mass to my plate. My boyfriend had the squid ink ravioli special, and tasting it, I noticed the same thing. Desserts were very nice, to be fair. There are too many other phenomenal Italian restaurants citywide to tempt me into coming back here.	2star
Bad experience here. For a nice place... Their food is good but service is terrible. I had an incident with my food it spilled on the floor and they charged me for a second dish. The manager really has no idea what he's doing. I wouldn't recommend going here if you are looking for a place with good vibes	1star
I'm a huge pasta lover and I can honestly say that the scarpetta signature spaghetti dish may be the best pasta I have ever had, better than the pasta in Italy. Absolutely delicious, i did not want it to end. Our waitress Lilly was wonderful, so friendly and agreeable. She recommended a delicious wine to pair with the pasta, it was also perfect. Bread was fantastic.  4 different kinds and they bring extra if you want.  Entire staff was great, the manager, busboys, etc.  If I'm ever on death row, bring me here for my last meal!!!	5star
We came here after a bit of wandering around Carroll Gardens on a saturday night and being told Frankies 457 was going to be over an hour wait. I'm a Manhattan gal so we just yelped to see what popped up and that's how we ended up at Fragole.  My friend and I both had specials of the day me: the gnocci (I can't resist) with a simple tomato sauce and chunks of melty mozzarella him: the ravioli (I can't quite recall what was in it) We both enjoyed our dishes (which were decently sized, nothing too crazy) and were impressed that all pastas (I think) were freshly made in-house. But I wish I had racked my head a little harder (and been a bit better with my Brooklyn geography) and remembered that I had been in Carroll Gardens before and to another Italian joint at that because I really like Savoia's food better (and ambiance I might add) but the bread and olive (?) dipping sauce we were given was my dinner highlight. It was mighty tasty.  Didn't glance at the wine-list but all in all, it was a good experience and the music wasn't too oppressively loud (could easily talk over it without having much trouble) and the service was great (never had to ask for a water refill once).	3star

Horrible service from the young lady at the register .... had an attitude as soon as I started to order as if I was bothering her .... loaded fried with salmon cost 7.49 loaded fries with shrimps cost 7.99 I asked for loaded fries with both she asked for $23 idk where tf she learn math from but it was a horrible experience of customer service.... in the only one in the restaurant and it took forever to come	1star
Stopped in without a reservation at 2:00 pm today It was a zoo and a circus combined!  Nasty and rude host! Lived in nyc and never made it in and now as a visitor I made an attempt! Meant to be....

"I've been patronizing black swan for years. Always a  great experience. This evening I had one of the poorest levels of customer service at restaurant.  First, an order was placed for a Bellini and an earl grey tea and an order of wings for appetizer. 20 mins passes by and the waitress brings a Bellini and ""breakfast tea"" stating there was no earl grey tea so she made a decision to bring her choice. Imo if someone requests something and you don't have it you inform them so the person paying can make the decision on what they'd like to digest! So the server brings over green tea. Cool.  More time passes and its about an hr and 30 mins now no wings. No communication from the server. So i inquire about the wait. An unapologetic ""manager"" states "" a waitstaff left early"" giving no sincerity for the lack of customer service. Telling a patron the waitstaff left early  sounds like a personal problem. I came to spend money in an establishment and a  level of service is expected. Im all for waiting, but courtesy is informing me sorry for the wait etc. The ""manager"" becomes combative like restaurant staffing is somehow out of her control. The most unprofessional experience at BLACK SWAN EVER!  After waiting over an hr for an order of wings. The ""manager"" brings 1 plate of eggs Benedict and states to the person im dining with "" Do you want it"" After waiting over a fucking hour youd think yes the food is needed. She then goes back and forth with the person I was dining with stating she did not know we were waiting this long. The server then brings my meal which was wrong and apologizes for the mistake and tells me she will place another order to fix it. At this point I was beyond hungry and upset; would've just changed my order to add sweet potato fries and be good but the attitude of the ""manager"" was a complete turn off. I informed my server we would be leaving and asked for the check for the tea and Bellini. The server was more apologetic than the snooty ""manager"" . I told her it was ok.  I understand being understaffed can be overwhelming in the restaurant business and trying your best. If I was new to black swan ok i wouldn't have been so turned off. But as much as i frequent this restaurant and recommend it to others and the person i was dining with !! This was unacceptable. This ""manager"" needs managerial training because she's making this establishment look Bad!"	1star
This is one of my favorite tourist destinations in NYC!  They serve family style Italian.  Every dish is meant for 4 people.  We ordered the Chicken Parmesan and Escarole.  It was all delicious.  The only reason it is not 5 stars is because we went close to closing and our waitress was obviously ready to leave.  She asked to take all of our salt, pepper etc before we were done eating.   We had a 10:30 reservation and they closed at 11.  We were even early.	4star
My husband and I love this place. It's always laid back and has great music. We usually order a lobster roll, lobster dinner but on this particular visit we were lucky enough to make it in for HH and I had $1 oysters. The oysters were so fresh and tasty. We ordered the lobster mac and cheese and the lobster fries. We shared that. I would order both again but not simultaneously. It was just too much cheese for two people in one sitting lol. I mean I love cheese but we got full and fast. Both dishes had a more than satisfying helping of lobster in each. They didn't skimp on the lobster. Service is always great. I will continue to be loyal to the red hook lobster pound.	5star
I got the Luke's trio like I always do whenever I go to a Luke's lobster. The shrimp was actually the best of three. The crab didn't have much flavor and there was too much lobster claw meet in the lobster roll that made it too gooey. Hopefully they'll have fresher crab and better portion distribution in the lobster roll!	3star
"When Garage closed last year I was crushed. It was the perfect mix of late night jazz, sophisticated cocktails and food. But when I realized a traditional French restaurant had replaced Garage I was relieved and anxious for a taste. The taste only made me miss Garage more. On a positive note, the renovations are genius. The space has been beautifully optimized. Said renovations, however, create certain expectations for guests. Especially when you take a glance at the menu and realize you are paying for the new decor. When I saw favorites on the menu I initially had no issue with the mild sticker shock. Ooh la la, I mused. I couldn't resist ordering the mousse de foie gras for my appetizer. Indeed, it was the high point of my meal. The flavors were perfectly balanced with a slightly acidic but still savory green salad with caramelized onions. The bread that accompanied the duck liver was well seasoned and toasted. Even the extra bread my friend requested came with a beautiful side of assorted olives and a healthy side of prosciutto. It seemed, at first, that our money would be well spent on a fantastic dining experience. And then the entrées arrived.  At first I believed I had just chosen wrong. I'd ordered the Cavatelli au lapin. Lapin is a favorite of mine, typically served either in a stew over rich mashed potatoes or as a shank alongside them with another sweet side (carrots, perhaps?) to offset the saltiness of the rabbit. This ricotta cavatelli appeared to be served in no more than a marinara sauce, topped with shredded rabbit and an odd sprinkling of almonds. Yet despite the unfavorable flavor combination, it somehow managed to be bland! The innate flavor of the rabbit was lost, buried in an unpleasantly tangy bowl of dull consistency.  I found myself looking longingly over at my friend's saumon à l'unilateral, only to discover when he cut me a forkful that the salmon was equally bland. The cut was large and visually impeccable, but tasted more of water than it did fish. I found the flavor of the fingerling potatoes to be equally muted, redeemed only by the occasional brightness of the leek fondue. When dessert menus were offered we ordered the tarte tartin. I cannot comment on the taste of the tarte tartin. Not because I didn't have any, but because it was smothered in such a rich caramel sauce that to taste anything but was impossible. The sauce was reminiscent of an over-sweet, butterscotch candy - there's a reason those are made to be only but so big. Perhaps the flavorless poof of cream on the plate was meant to temper the overwhelming sweetness of the caramel. Unfortunately the plate was literally swimming in it, rendering even the smallest of bites inedible. As a result the small chocolate twig meant as a garnish, the only thing out of the sauce's reach, was the only palatable thing on the plate. I didn't feel that the service was terrible. It wasn't terrible. However, I can understand the displeasure as the decor sets high expectations. I'll give them this - the service is a unique kind of bad. A creative kind. It isn't that we weren't checked on and tended to. We were. And it isn't that the servers were so attentive that they were overbearing and we had to start clicking out private conversations with our silverware in Morse code. The flaws were not so obvious. It was the interactions themselves that seemed inexplicably brusque since the place wasn't packed. Our server nearly pushed my wine glass clean off the table and onto my white coat, for instance, when trying to make room for a plate. (Who pushes a wine glass?) The dessert menu was quickly snatched from in front of me once my friend ordered a dessert for us to share, which is a shame because I had every intention of ordering a nightcap. And then there's the annoying question of why she didn't ask? Because I was a woman? Because I didn't speak French? Because the owners spent too much money on the fancy white floor to train her properly? Because turning to someone and asking, ""and for you?"" or just a simple, ""anything else?"" is beyond basic. You get that at a Burger King drive through at 3am - is it really too much to ask as I order my overpriced food? And speaking of overpriced... The butcher bar. Not to say it is unheard of to spend these amounts on an exquisite cut of meat in a very good restaurant. But appearance alone does not make a restaurant exceptional and coming from the same kitchen that managed to mess up a salmon I fear an order of anything from the butcher bar would only yield further disappointment.  Lastly, I do not have it out for this restaurant, but I do believe in fine cuisine and if you dress yourself up as the type of restaurant that can offer such an experience, you owe it. Which reminds me - presentation? Sloppy. I do hope that Boucherie manages to live up to its fancy renovations soon. The space is sentimental to me and I really want to like it there.  With better food I just might."	2star
It's the famous Ipudo, 40min wait, that's how much time you should anticipate as an average diner.  It's not too bad if you are a ramen lover. I tried out two things, maguro tartare and the seasonal shoyu ramen.  It's a specialized taste not and completely memorable.  The tartare has a bitter and alcoholic and strong taste, its salty with that strange twist.  Whereas the shoyu ramen, as advertised, has some vertical depth to it, in the first sip you'd taste shoyu then the oysterish seafood flavor, very unique for the US customers.  The things that I'd wish to be different for a five star rating, both orders are too salty.  And the atmosphere has lost the ramen ruggedness feel to it, the dinnerware, the lack of spices at table ... It's the famous Ipudo.	4star
Went inside and stood at the entrance for 5 whole minutes and no one even entertained us. One of the staff was on her break eating and noticed but still continued eating. So my friends and I just walked out and went to the restaurant adjacent to it.	1star
We just happened upon this little place when exploring West Village. We were originally only looking for a place to have a glass of wine, but when they sat us down ahead of larger groups with reservations, we felt obligated to order something off the menu to share.  The restaurant was tiny, with two rooms and a bar. It is lit by candlelight, making it a great place for a date. I'm almost certain that my friend and I were the only two tourists in the place, as there were large parties there for birthdays, anniversaries, etc.  We both had a glass of Pinot Grigio for $8, the cheapest drink on the menu. We then ordered the Smoked Bacon Wrapped Scallops appetizer to share. My friend had never had scallops before, but she loved them just as much as I did! They were truly fantastic! Bacon, of course, is always good, but it gave the scallops a lovely smokey flavor. There were only 3 scallops, but they were served over horseradish mashed potatoes, which were excellent and a small salad with red wine/balsamic vinaigrette with grapes.  We can only imagine that the food was just as fantastic! Highly recommended!	4star
"It's one thing to be told to wait at the bar, it's another thing to have the bartender then kick you out of the area to the other waiting area. I arrived before my friend and asked how long the wait would be. I gave them the benefit of the doubt when they told me that all they had was  ""one table outside"" despite a nearly empty inside (could be reservations, it's cool) and they told me to wait at the bar and gestures to the one in the front. I go and sit but then, since I wasn't ordering a drink, the bartender rudely tells me to go to the other bar (as if I knew where that was). It's not like there was that many people coming to the bar anyways but that's ok, I would rather spend my money in a place that treats its potential customers better."	1star
Yelp let me down on this one.  Stuffy. Not my crowd. Not a place for a girls night out. Food was mediocre so I have no idea how this got a Michelin star. It seriously makes no sense. The tuna tartare was dry and absolutely forgettable and so was the ceviche. The branzino was underwhelming at best. The duck was  the only saving grace. Pork was okay.  Nothing special. Lamb was decent.  What an overpriced meal.  Even the dessert was ridiculous. We got 2 ice cream but they were very tiny. The chocolate cake was way too sweet you can't survive more than 3 bites. Our server did not even smile at all. It felt like he hated his job so much he couldn't even hide it for a second.	3star

Their reputation for their soup dumplings stay strong. And they know that. Once your party has been seated down, the waiter immediately asks what soup dumplings you would like, already assuming that you came here with that sole purpose, which I am not going to lie -- that was my only purpose. I ordered the pork and crab soup dumplings and they arrived at my table in a piping hot bamboo steamer. I was so happy when I picked one of the soup dumplings up to see how plump it was, indicating how filled the dough is with the meaty broth. Now you have been warned to be careful with these intricate and delicate dumplings as they do break easily when they're hot (which was a problem for me because I just couldn't WAIT to eat it) and since it was heavier than most dumplings in terms of the filling and the soup. The pork meatball inside the soup dumpling was very tender and well marinated. You can just tell that they mixed all the ingredients very well. The most complicated part of the soup dumpling is the soup. It is actually a super gelatinous stock that has been cooled and cut into cubes and put inside the dough. The stock was very rich in flavor and it had bits and pieces of aromatics. Joe's Shanghai has definitely mastered the complicated dim sum staple. Every time I have their freshly made to order soup dumplings, my heart actually feels content. It just brings back memories from childhood.	5star
I was in town for the weekend, and absolutely had to have a taste of New York pizza! This place was perfect!  They serve by the slice until 5 PM so if you are not in the mood for a whole pizza or do not have a huge group I would definitely recommend getting there before then. We tried to come here one night and it was over an hour wait, but we were able to get in right away the next morning for lunch. Great waitstaff, great menu, great atmosphere. Overall wonderful experience.	5star
Thumbs up for taking reservations because c'mon, who wants to wait to eat on a Sunday morning? I want good coffee and food now! I tried the sicilian baked eggs, the short rib hash, and the benedict johnny here.  - The benedict johnny is so interesting as the chef swapped out the english muffin for cheddar corn bread. I think it's a much better vehicle for the poached eggs and hollandaise, as english muffins are not so good soggy whereas the cornbread mops up all that yolk and sauce and becomes even more flavorful.  - The short rib hash is good, but I wished the shoe string potatoes would be crispy for textural contrasts. Every bite was creamy and meaty. While good, I became a little bored halfway in and wanted a different texture.  - The sicilian baked eggs seems unassuming, but the artichokes are delicious and the spicy tomato sauce actually has a subtle heat that pairs really well with the creamy yolk and the burrata. This is a dish that will warm up your core and help you in the recovery process after a late night out. Tip: If you come on Sunday mornings, you get a free drink with an order of breakfast! It's written across the top, but our party TOTALLY missed it last time we came. I only found out about it today because the waitress pointed it out to us.	4star

I thought L'artusi was amazing until I came here. dishes eaten: -Baby Wild Arugula -Black Spaghetti w/ Rock Shrimp, Spicy Salami Calabrese & Green Chilies -Gnocchi w/ Braised Oxtail wow is all I have to say. the two pasta dishes were so good it felt like my mouth was on xanax; the flavors combining and everything melting in my mouth at once. It took the waiter a while to come take our orders/bring oil for the bread/refill water, which is my only complaint because we sat at 6pm and Babbo had yet to be poppin' off with a full dining room. 10/10 will go back.	5star

"I have nothing against Park Avenue Tavern, it's perfectly adequate as a post-work happy hour spot (but with no real ""happy hour""). It's easy to get to from GC, and it has a good crowd of suit-wearing professionals (mostly dudes) after work. You can make rezzies online. There's decent food selection, consistent with midtown prices-- expensive. $13 for stale flatbread (the flatbread was stiff and chewy, and the fried tomato one was odd). The $15 tuscan kale salad was a little gritty and over dressed. You could get a better salad at sweetgreen for less than that, but that's not the point... I know, I know. Hey, the $12 cheese curds were good! They had a few options for glasses of wine for $12. Service was great. Upstairs was incredibly loud and it impossible to hear my friend across the table. It might be a better experience to sit downstairs next time, and maybe not during happy hour time?"	3star

Pros: Unique atmosphere with a big table in the middle surrounding the bar Cons: Drinks were unmemorable. The cocktails were all too sweet. The happy hour was good-ish, but can definitely find better deals in the neighborhood.	3star
Tucked away in New York's Chinatown is this little place where you can find the famous soup dumpling. The place is small and the service is not the fastest but the food is pretty good. We ordered the pork and crab soup dumplings and they were delicious!! The onion pancake was pretty good. We also ordered the noodles with meat sauce. While I enjoyed the udon like noodles themselves, I wasn't a huge fan of the flavoring of the sauce. Giving this place 3.5 stars because mostly everything was pretty good. And the prices weren't very expensive when compared to other parts of the city.  Follow me on my way to foodietown! 	3star
"Frequent visitor to the district tap house, but will no longer recommend this spot to anyone. I came to this bar on April 1st, 2017 between 9PM and 11PM and had a terrible experience with the hostess. I should've got her name, she is by far the worst hostess I have met at any restaurant. I wouldn't let her host my worst enemy.  As I was waiting to get seated, I saw the hostess eating a burger with her friends and chatting with them, as me and my friend waited to be seated. I point to her, and ask my friend ""Is that the hostess?""  Upon her seeing us, and seeing that we had been waiting for her, she said to us: ""well, its my dinner time too."" I don't care....do your job. I mentioned to her that we wanted to grab a bite and wanted to grab a table. Note: if you look behind us there are 75% of tables that are free. She says to us ""I will need the table back by 11PM."" Ridiculous!! I mention to her that we are happy to leave if they need the table, and she obliges.  As we get seated, she mentions to me and my guest ""please do eat, we aren't allowed to give a table otherwise."" What type of nonsense is this! We had full intention for eating, I don't need you to remind me. Me and my guest had good beers an good food, and good service from the waitress, but I would highly recommend  management figuring out who this person is and  setting her straight."	1star
Great Food, Service and views!!!! :) Their pasta, pizza and appetizers are to die for!	5star
Zero stars for my experience tonight.  I ordered the filet of sole, which I ate. It was moderately fishy and extremely dry. So I asked the waiter what I ordered and he came back with a snarky response. I then asked for the check. Then he called me rude. Then, I DID say an expletive because I was soooo frustrated and then he told me to get out!   I then tried took my check to the bartender and paid him. This was, by far, the worst dining experience I've  had in over 20 years! Will never be back...	1star
"The extent to which Katz' operates with this annoying ""we're where a famous movie scene was filmed"" swagger which hasn't aged well, especially since an entire generation has been born and grown up not knowing or caring who Billy Crystal or Meg Ryan are, nor do they care how ""I'll have what she's having"" became such a widespread saying. So to dine at Katz's~ where the staff is brusque, where getting a pastrami sandwich takes a stupidly long time, and where the set-up of the place seems purposely confusing~ knowing that a famous movie was filmed here really doesn't do it for me like perhaps it would for someone of my parent's generation. I don't care much for the attitude and ""fumes of nostalgia"" arrogance with which it carries itself. I think they purposely make the ordering and paying process confusing and time-consuming, as part of keeping its no-nonsense old-school Lower East Side deli vibe... which is fine, if you weren't so eagerly content to live off of your fame and place a sign over the table where ""Harry met Sally"". Which do you want~ the old-school neighborhood deli or the famous tourist destination? Having both takes away from the charm and makes the place feel rather exploited more than iconic. Yeah, you guys had ""cutting stations"" back in the beginning when you weren't as famous, where a worker would make you a sandwich right in front of you while making small talk. But now that you're famous and you have ridiculously long lines, maybe you don't have to do it that way anymore, especially since your cutters these days (at least the one that did my sandwich) aren't that down for banter and small talk with the customers anyway (though they do ostentatiously place their tip buckets right in front of them as they're cutting). Oh yes, and if want a side of something, they can't put the order in for you; you have to get in yet another long line yourself. Great. So why 3 stars instead of something lower? Well, the PASTRAMI'S actually quite good haha. Curing meats is no joke, and they do a really good job. I just don't care for any of the nonsense that comes with being a customer of this place."	3star
usually this place gets top marks from me but i got takeout last week and instead of a sausage quesadilla they gave me a sausage torta and the egg and beans mushy quesadilla and an extra taco. they got the order completely wrong and the mushy quesadilla was inedible and it costed me $25. do better please.	1star
I ordered the crispy pork with Chinese broccoli . The meat wasn't  crispy at all !!!! Papaya salad wasn't that good either .	2star
I made the reservation about 3 weeks ago and they called 2 days prior to confirm it. A good restaurant host would offer early patrons to sit at the bar to generate more income for the business but I guess Peter Luger is making so much money that they didn't care; instead, everyone jam packed the entrance area to wait for their tables.   We sat on the right-hand side of the restaurant, a corner table against the window, it has a slight old house mildew odor coming from the wall or the window. Our server was on the slow side because he was busy with a larger group, not a big deal.  He was friendly and attentive. Bread came but it was COLD!! We ordered - 2 pieces of bacon ($5.95 each) - a must have, really good. Steak for Two ($107.90) - we wanted medium well but our waiter suggested medium, it turned out to be a bit too rare for us but the plate was piping hot so we literally cooked all the raw parts on it.  The steak crust is delicious, savory and full of flavor but the inside is tasteless, I guess that's why they give you steak sauce. Creamed spinach for 2 ($11.95) - creamy but a bit on the salty side. 2 sodas ($3.95 each) - bottled, not canned. For a $177 lunch, my expectation was on the high side.  I had better steak elsewhere with much cheaper price. I almost forgot to mention there was an annoying fly hovering the steak during our meal.	3star
Difficult review,as the food was very good, but the service following was lacking at best. We set up some time for a meeting there, and had the worst time getting accurate billing following.  If accuracy and timely responses are important to you, Amali is NOT the place to go.	2star
We went to New York for vacation and I found this restaurant by reviews on yelp. This is a great restaurant on time square. The experience was amazing. We stared with a sea food soup and then a linguini Monsignor bottle of chianti. Everything was amazing. The Venezuelan server was great. I will come back every time I visit New York. I definitely recommend this place.	5star
Been about 30 minutes since our order for lobster roll and fish n chips...hmmm...while I like the drink I nursed,this is unacceptable....any restaurant that makes you feel less than specical for  20$ lobster roll should rethink the prices... Will I ever...EVER ..come back......plain and simple..NO. Go cross the bridge to Manhattan,I say. They did try and redeem themselves with a smile and a dessert (on the house) when our lunch was done. This made the walk to Manhattan over the Brooklyn bridge sweet.... :)	3star
I visited Atrium Dumbo with my girlfriend a few weeks ago for Saturday Brunch. I made reservations in advance but saw that it wasn't needed seeing how spacious this place was. We were seated on the upper level, away from some of the noise downstairs, which was nice. The place was dimly lit with natural light coming in from outside, creating a great atmosphere. She got the omelette and I got the flank steak. The omelette was cooked well, and tasted good but not great when taking price into consideration ($14). The gruyere has a very prominent taste that cheese lovers may enjoy. My girlfriend found the dish a little too salty for her taste. The flank steak was cooked to perfection, as well as the green beans, grits and eggs that came along with it. I would definitely go back for this one! This dish was a bit salty for me as well but not enough for it to bother me. Overall this place is great, within walking distance of great coffee shops and Brooklyn Bridge Park.	4star
We had a graduation party for 13. I ordered  the 6 course prix fixe of the duck for the party. Also wanted a sampling of the rib eye as well. My family loves food, so I was bit concerned if we would have enough food hence ordering the extra plate of beef.  The courses before the duck were so awesome. Small portions, that that was fine.  Then comes the duck and the beef. Omg. The portions were huge!!!  And sooo good!  We had way too much food at this point. But fortunately we had locals and ourselves so we packed up the leftovers for home.  This is a great place for a gathering with the prix fixe selection option. Lots of food. And they put us in the back room with other large parties. I was able to arrange this all through email for the most part. Highly recommended. And great food!  Thanks to Gabrielle and the staff at Momofuku Ssam!	5star
"Staff was nice. Food was OK. Came here for brunch on Sunday at 3pm.  I ordered the Eggs Benedict with the $25 prix fixe, I should've taken I picture of it but it was pretty sad looking.  The first course was a plate of ""savory"" items that honestly looked like it came out of a box at the grocery store.  The yogurt and fresh fruit was delicious though.  Entree was decent,  nothing extraordinary.. probably won't order this again.  My friend and I never received our ""sweet"" course (I'm guessing because we had brought a cake for a birthday? Regardless, the ""sweet"" course should've been brought out because we paid for it.) Pros: tasty bread basket for the table, there's a shuttle service for local residents (call to ask if you're within the vicinity), clean atmosphere,  good for large parties,  $15 bottomless drink specials, friendly staff Cons: food was underwhelming.. my boyfriend's turkey burger had a burnt bun that was inedible. Prix fixe brunch is a rip off,  stick to the regular menu items. Pretty disappointed after seeing such great reviews on Yelp. Also, at the end of our meal the staff (about 6 people) surrounded our table. We thought they did that because they were closed, turns out they weren't. The entire restaurant was empty so it wasn't like they needed the table either.  Very awkward and rude."	2star
I came here to celebrate a special event with my parents, but we left sorely disappointed. The ambience of the restaurant is lovely, but it did not make up for the food nor the service.  We ordered the SHELLFISH PLATEAUX ROYALE, which in retrospect did not seem worth as it was over-priced, and although the seafood was fresh, it did not seem high quality.  We also had the CIOPPINO, a striped bass dish, and the NORI CRUSTED TUNA. The cioppino tasted a little off and was very very bitter. There were no complaints about the bass dish, and lastly although the flavor of the tuna was good, I think having the nori crust ruins the texture of the tuna and was overall not a very good dish.  As for the service, I was really disappointed for how we were treated by our waiter. I'm not sure if we had too many questions about the menu or what, but I could see our waiter visibly deflate whenever we called him over. If you don't like a table, then fine, but try not to show it at least.  Overall, I had a bad experience, bad enough where I will not be coming back or recommending this restaurant to anyone I know.	2star
Ordered delivery of their lunch special (3 different dishes for 3 people). We got curries and pineapple fried rice. Curries were super runny, no flavor and straight up not edible! I've never had a curry that bad in my life. Ended up throwing it out. Pineapple fried rice was very mediocre. Not as bad as the curries but not delicious like it normally is pretty much anywhere. Appetizers that came with the lunch special were soggy small portions of dumplings that were on par with bad cafeteria food. Super disappointing! Not ordering again.	1star
This Place is you need to experience soup dumplings at. Their food is full of flavor and as authentic as I could assume the real thing is. Just try it and you will not be disappointed. Straight up amazing. I judged my review on the Y1, Y3, S2,S5,B1, and more to come	5star
came here with my GF for an event. The location was a walk away from the trains, but it wasn't terrible. The decor falls in line with the typical chic ambiance--and I get the feeling that they're going for in terms of service, but it seemed as though the staff was new. That isn't to say service was bad by any stretch, but they seemed a bit green. I wont go through all that we ordered because we definitely ordered more than we could handle, but I will say my GF who doesn't drink seemed to enjoy the cocktails, and the food wasn't much to her liking(she tends to be a picky eater) but seeing as I ate to the point of pain, I think it's not a bad idea to try at least once if you're in the area.	4star
I'd heard great things about Cookshop and was super excited to check it out for breakfast. Came here on a random weekday morning right when it opened so it wasn't crowded, but throughout the breakfast, lots of people started showing up. Loved the decor. It has this simple, modern vibe and the floor to ceiling windows, with all the lovely sunshine coming through, were wonderful.  I ordered the Cold Pressed Green Juice and Spinach & Cheddar Scramble. The juice was on point! Tasty and full of good stuff. The scramble was also delicious. The eggs were nice and fluffy, the onions beautifully caramelized, and all the ratios were spot on. It was also way too much food! I could barely finish my eggs and had only a few bites of the scone, which was a shame because it was good. It was a big, hearty, Southern-style scone, warm and crumbly. I personally like scones with a little more flavor, but this one was tasty too. Service was nice and I had a great time. Would definitely come back!	4star
We went here for some Ramen because Ippudo which is half a block away had a 3 hr wait. Oh god, I could make better ramen at home. No, thank you!	2star
I would never had given this place a chance if it were not for my significant other wanting to try Cuban food. I was afraid this would be a fast food Chinese restaurant in disguise. & Chinese food is alright, but not when we were trying to celebrate a birthday. From the time we finally made the decision to give this place a shot, we were glad. We had private seating in the higher level- giving us view to the large part of the restaurant. Our waiter (Max) was so delightful. He explained everything and was so helpful. It is about a week later and we cannot stop talking about the Char Sui Pork. For me the batata was the deal sealer. The pork was so tender and the dipping sauces for the yucca fries were tangy/unique. That meal was A+. I had the Cuban spring rolls too, but those weren't 'woah' for me. This restaurant will do well in this area but they should consider having more drink specials (as their mixed drinks were over $15 each.) Overall, great above and beyond staff and good food.	4star
"The night was storybook, borne by pure literary fiction. There weren't any sci-fi menu choices (sans the ""bone marrow butter""), zombified monotone specials-spitting waiters, gun-twirling, drink-lassoing barmen, edge-of-your-seat breaths between bites, nor any exceedingly syrupy hyperbolic restaurant-related dinner moments. The Jacob's Pickles experience was exactly how someone would have written it in a novel. I'll admit I had a specific imaginary vision of Jacob's Pickles; I pictured white walls with center-of-the-sea-blue decorative accents, plastic Sheraton chairs, a menu written in monochromatic chalk, waiters donning paper hats, etc. I cannot tell you from where this imaginary mishmosh came, but while I stood outside a hip, shadowy restaurant lit only by light cast from glinting mason jar-ed tea candles trimming the walls, I realized my delusion was far from the Jacob's Pickles in this universe. Exposed brick walls and deep, muted rosewood accents in the main dining area and bar carried into a tucked away dining area where we were seated in a cozy nook. A soft, rufescent glow imbued the room, haloing faces and conversations. Tables were lined with requisite mason jar candles, waiters carried chipper smiles, and while the music was perhaps overbearing and mismatched in both volume and genre (i.e. Spotify's Workout Twerkout Playlist), it consumed each party in an orb of seclusion wherein the interstice between one another was left purely for personal conversation. It is not often that a restaurant can be symmetrically romantic and lively, as well as offer a luscious menu. I ordered the Rosemary Lemonade Vodka adorned with a sprig of rosemary so long I could have used it as a stirrer, waved it around my apartment to ward off unwanted spirits, or pocketed it for cooking in the near future. From that drink began an evening as pure as any fabled summertime night. In the words of the omnipotent Samuel Beckett, ""You're on Earth. There's no cure for that."" But there is a cure, and I've found it; it's the biscuits and fixins at JP. Served with otherworldly fixins including butters, honey, and fruit preserves, the biscuits are on the cusp of creating their own gravitational force. One cannot imagine the breadth of unrealness contained in the two butters (salt and maple), not to mention the epitomically subtle orange preserves. The last line of James Joyce's short story ""The Dead"" is considered the most subtle sentence in the English language (if you didn't think I would squeeze in another literary reference you were wrong); if Joyce was alive today he'd fib and say the orange preserves were the original point of inspiration for that famously subtle line. There's an unspoken life bylaw that states ""If a restaurant is named after a food item or contains a food item in its name, the food item must be ordered and eaten."" It's hard to find the right selection of words to adequately describe the eponymous pickles, other than: ""the restaurant is named after them for a reason."" One of the night's many specials was chicken parmigiana mac and cheese. If there was even an ounce of delusion in the night, it was contained beneath the layers of mac, cheese, and chicken of the dish. It's hard to imagine a more delicious concoction that borders on being real. To quote Charles Bukowski, ""You have to die a few times before you can really live."" I'd like to add an asterisk after the word ""die"" to include ""and eat at Jacob's Pickles."""	5star
I love coming here. Can get crowded but food usually comes out quick, the drinks are delicious. They're open late and have nice, chill outdoor seating. No table service as far as I know, so pay attention to your number getting called. They also have other events for families and adults so check out their calendar.	4star
Came with a party of 4 and got the smoked ribs, whole roasted fish, 28 day dry aged striploin, and rotisserie duck. Everything was delicious and well made. The duck rotisserie itself could feed 3 people easily. The Duck Duck Suze cocktail was $20 and it was questionable at best considering it was the most expensive cocktail. It came in a small glass - no garnish, nothing and the flavor was not spectacular so minus 1 star for that. Service was great- we were given new plates and utensils after every course and our water glasses were always full. The waitress notified our party that the rotisserie duck would take 50 minutes, however it actually took about 1.5 hours to get to the table.	4star
The place is beautiful but.... service is horrible. My friend almost ended up in the hospital because they mixed all of our vegetables together even after stating that she was allergic to mushrooms. The server was very unapologetic and didn't do a thing to fix it. Also, they only take a max of two credit cards so good luck splitting the bill.  Go to another Korean BBQ.. better yet try flushing, queens!	1star
Great ambiance. My first time here and I enjoyed the people and atmosphere. They have a great bar area with side tables for the spillover crowd. The music level is perfect as you navigate between it and the crowd noise. There is also outdoor seating that was popping when I went with good people and good weather  My reason for 3 stars is the food I ate. While the cornbread was delicious, the other side we ordered were not worth the cost. $9 for a small order of French fries, and the wild winds were not tasty at all. The mac and greens were good but only a handful for the price. The bottom line is that it is a great place to go with friends after work but I would eat elsewhere if you are just coming to hang. I'll add that I did not have the entrees which looked good, so my food comments are directed toward the appetizers and cost of them.  I will definitely return.	3star
A cute little place for brunch. Drinks aren't bad and food is decent. My complaint is that the yolk wasn't that runny with my waffle benedict. Overall an average brunch place, would recommend if you haven't tried but probably would not return.	3star
"I just had the worst experience ordering food I've ever had in NY.  I used Uber Eats to order the rice & beans, empanadas, chopped salad and milkshake. I requested no egg in the salad (which could be seen on the notes of my order in Uber Eats) However the salad had a large fried egg. I called the restaurant to let them know about the mistake and the manager was very rude. The minute I described the order she said that ""it's Uber's problem because we did not have that note."" I asked to exchange the order and she said there's nothing that she could do. I called back again and she talked over me the entire time and we got into a shouting match so I hung up. I called again hoping to get a different manager but it was her again. Sense I couldn't reason with her over the phone, I went to the restaurant to hopefully talk to another manager or at least reason with her in person. The manager showed me that the restaurant didn't receive the No Egg note (but did get the dressing on the side message, which seems weird- I'm assuming Uber has a major glitch) and proceeded to argue with me for a full 7 minutes about how the restaurant shouldn't have to ""pay for the mistake of Uber.""  She kept asking me to report it to the app (which I am did but I knew that by the time I did that and possibly waited for a new salad to be delivered, it would have been after midnight - possibly closer to 1am) The whole situation didn't make sense. Her customer service skills were extremely lacking. Literally all I wanted was just an even exchange for a salad without egg but she felt it was more important to tell me about how ""I need to understand how things work"" and ""it's not our responsibility to pay for a mistake we didn't make."" After another 5 minutes of cutting me off and arguing I pointed out that the problem could've been solved a while ago, and that she was creating a bad dining experience for everyone at the counter not just me. I said that she just wanted to argue, to which She replied ""I just need you to understand that this is wrong. Don't do it again!"" (as if I caused this problem on purpose or wanted this issue to deal with!) and then she walked away (to get the salad fixed).  I just feel like this whole situation could've been handled better by her. She felt it was more important to shame me and hurt my feelings and prove that she was right, rather than concede sooner so the customer could have a better experience. ( Also beware of Uber Eats glitches)"	2star
This is probably my least favorite place I have ever been to ever. To get in they act like it's Studio 54, to have your order served you better count on dying first, and to get good food you better believe in miracles. I serve people for a living, I don't fault the establishment for the outcome I fault the individuals. Unfortunately in this case, I couldn't even tell you who those individuals we're. If it wasn't for my date my butt would be in bed in my 7th dream, but because I'm not and I'm subjected to this nonsense I'm bitter and upset. Are you leaving the club and hungry? Well then good luck to you and, don't look to Coppelia. I can't speak to any other hour or meal, but my 5am experience left much to be desired and I regret staring down the bouncer to get it.	1star
"We had a reservation for 4 people for 7:30pm on a Friday evening in August. When we arrived, we were told that we had to take  table for 3. (They said, ""Oh, that's a table for 5""). Well, not in my world. Not only was it a table for 3, but it was right in front of the door and was squished up against the bar, where others were seated. There were several empty tables for 4 available and when we asked for one of those we were told they could seat us at the community table. So, we left and to a perfectly customer friendly restaurant nearby of which there are dozens... The four of us will not be going back again to be treated like second class citizens...so beware if you still decide to go."	1star

This place is AH-MAZ-ING!!! I freaking love everything about it. First of all, this magical land is hidden behind an ugly graffiti drawn red door on a semi deserted street in Brooklyn. Behind that red door, you will find the BEST PIZZA YOU HAVE EVER TASTED!  The wait was about 40 minutes for a table of two. The dining room is small and they have a large community table, but it was totally worth the wait. While we were waiting, we went outside to their tented, heated, super hipster tiki bar. It was the perfect day to try their spiked bourbon hot cider. The tiki bar has really unique decorations including a deer head with a glow necklace. They also have Super Nintendo to play while you wait.  So if you don't want to wait for a table, you can go to the tiki bar and order pizza To go at the to go Roberta's next door and then eat it at the tiki bar. We saw some people doing this and they got their pizza within 15 minutes.  The pizza was fresh and light and crispy. The crust was thin and fluffy and the toppings were top quality and I believe the mozzarella is made in house. My recommendation: GET THE BEE STING!!	5star
Came here with my girlfriend, her little brother and her mother. This place opened up in forest hills only a few blocks away from my girlfriends house so we decided to give it a try. This place is usually pretty packed but has a lot of seating and a bar to sit at too. Very nice dim lit place to eat. They have benches or chairs to sit on but the benches were quite uncomfortable. This is a good place to get comfort food and they menu is very unique. Menu items were named after different neighborhoods in queens. We ordered the chicken pizza, salmon, half rack of ribs and salad. Having a little bit of everything made us feel like we had a taste of what Queens Bully has to offer. This is probably the most popular restaurant in forest hills now and I dont think the momentum will stop anytime soon	4star
They employees they have an attitude and very rude is good but nah!!!!  Been there twice same thing is like they doing you a favor I'm in the restaurant business. Is a thing call customer service no matter what you sale be nice and polite	1star
The concept is great however the service or I should say the quality of the food is poor. Management lacks engagement with public to truly understand the need.  Serving uncooked chicken ( blood running out) that are supposedly doubled fried.  I ordered burritos to be delivered and all I received was a burrito of rice and beans.  No meat.  When I called and spoke with management.  They told me I must pay for extra meat.  So I basically bought a meat less burrito.  Again. Customer service is not their strongest area.	1star
I've wanted to come here forever and for the most part it didn't disappoint. Our grilled dorade was amazing. The fish was super fresh and the char on the skin was excellent. The gigantes and lemon potatoes were also quite good. I'm usually not a fan of lemon potatoes but these ones didn't go too hard on the lemon and had some crispy edges. Sadly the grilled octopus was below average and overcooked leaving the meat kind of mushy and the skin totally desiccated. I saw other people get it and there's didn't look as bad so not sure what happened. Note that on a weekend, the wait can be for hours but if you got on a weeknight you can kinda just go in. The hostess told me that if you must go on a weekend, go at like 2:30 if you're trying to dodge the wait.	4star
Decent Old Fashion, half pepperoni, half Margherita. Margherita side needed more flavor in the sauce and cheese. Pepperoni was good and salty. Sicilian with thin crust, plenty of cheese.  Fresh Caesar salad on the side. Needed some ruffage to cut through the richness.  It IS the Financial District so take the train or cab to get there.	3star
"Wow, that was some POOR service. The waiter was completely inattentive and we had to ask to order, ask for water multiple times, ask for condiments to go with our food, etc. At times it felt as if we were being ""punked"" for a television show.  The food was fine.  We are extremely regular restaurant goers, however none of us will be back to this one."	1star

My friend and I went to PnT for late dinner last night. We arrived at 11:07 PM and ordered 2 fried chicken boxes at 11:15 PM. The dining experience was HORRENDOUS.  Took about an HOUR to get our food. Turns out the waiter did not place our order at all. But the host gave us some bullshit explanation that our order was delayed because I requested all dark meat. Meanwhile, all the customers seated after us had finished their meals and left the restaurant.  The chicken we attempted to eat was stale and tasted rubbery. Plus, they ran out of biscuits and gave us dry and hard cornbread instead.  The bill was $ 15.78 for inedible food. I should have left a 25 cent tip, but my friend suggested $ 3.	1star
I hate to start the new year with a sour review but, I just had to.  I came here last week for dinner with my family. We were seated for a party of 5 and we quickly ordered several dishes to and also ordered rice. The service is extremely slow! After 20 minutes we didn't get our food at all. We ordered food which wasn't what we asked for and they wanted us to pay for. We refused to do that since it wasn't our error. After a while of arguing they brought back the old dish and replaced with a new one. Towards the end of the meal, we still haven't received our rice and appetizers. We asked for the check and saw they had it on the bill, so we told them and then they wanted to bring it back out. We wanted it taken off the bill and they were giving a hard time when we clearly finished the meal. After some time they removed it from the bill.  The service was extremely poor and the food was mediocre. They ignored us several times and they didn't care that we weren't satisfied. Originally they walked away when we told them there was an error on the bill. All in all, such a terrible experience in a long time. I am definitely not coming back.	1star
Noodle village is great! Appears to be very authentic and where the locals go. Crowd is primarily Asians in their mid 20s n some slighty older couples, so if they(foodies) are here you know its good. I had their vegetable pan fried noodles and they were excellent. Full of flavor with the greens, sauce and mushrooms which carried the flavor and definitely worth it to return. It definitely fits meat eaters better than veggies as you will get strange looks if you ask for dishes and substitute tofu or have a veggie option. Ramen is good as well although tofu flavor did not give a good taste to the broth.	4star

I'm upset, and I'm hoping to receive an apology, and to see a change in policy with regard to boat rental during times of potential inclement weather. I had a horrifying experience yesterday, July 3rd 2017, while renting a rowboat. We had rowed to the far end of the lake (Northwest corner), when a thunderstorm rolled in. We had not been warned of any thunderstorm when we rented the boat. I can only assume that had we checked the weather we would have seen some t-storm chance percentage, but silly us, we did not look before we rented the boat. Long story short, we ended up in a frightening situation where we were in the middle of the lake during thunder, lightening, and rain so hard and cold and painful that it felt like we were being pelted with hail. We had no shelter, and feared being hit by lightening. Water accumulated quickly in the boat, which made me nervous, and also created a disgusting environment: garbage from previous boaters was floating around our ankles, tissues and hair, we had no place to escape the filth. The rain did not let up and we spent nearly a 1/2 hr trying to get back to land. It was dangerous, exhausting, and I am still recovering from the fright. I felt very unsafe, and walked away wondering why the Boat House would not have warned us of rain, or told us what we could do to keep safe in the event of inclement weather. Boat at your own risk, because there is clearly no one running the show here.	1star
This place was an experience - I did not say a good experience.  Fresh fish with an awful atmosphere.  LOUD, slow, too crowed.  Impossible to enjoy your tasty fresh meal with people hanging right over you.  Side dishes will catch up with the meal as if it is OK to pretend it is a desert because that is when they will remember to serve it to you. The are no hints posted of choice of cooking options or how their system works.  They expect a customer to know how to navigate the mysteries of this off beat place - is is really a major flaw.  Having had the experience I can not recommend this place unless you go very early in the day to avoid the crushing crowd.  There is fresh fish elsewhere.	1star
Ambiance = 4 Sexiness = 5 Food = 3 Service = 5 I came to the restaurant for my anniversary. I love the hostess stand at the entrance, the trendy vibe as you enter, and the attentive staff. The 'library', which is where we were seated, is off the main dining area, and is quiet and intimate. I was impressed by the waitress (Erin) and her extensive knowledge of the menu. Unfortunately, the food is good, but not amazing. As a vegetarian, there were only about 5 options, all of which seemed so lackluster.  All in all, a cute date spot.	4star
I came here yesterday for Mother's Day. The reviews on yelp were pretty good, so I was looking forward to eating here. After taking our drink order and delivering our drinks, we had to wait several minutes for the waiter to take our food order. I ordered the omelette. The omelette was mushroom and ricotta, it sounded a strange combo, but I have had stranger omelettes that were amazing. This one came and it was completely inedible. It was a plain eggs, no seasonings, the mushrooms were gigantic, unseasoned, and just globs of ricotta. There was no flavor in any of it. I honestly did not eat the omelette, and had to pick food up on my way home from here. Also, it was Mother's Day, and not one person in the restaurant wished my mother a Happy Mother's Day.	2star
Came here during for the lunch special during 12-3pm with my coworkers $9 entrees with an appetizer. We made it here before it started to get packed - yay us. We immediately got seated in the upper area, they gave us a small table for the three of us which I did not like so we grabbed another small table to make it more comfortable for us. After the waitress took our order, she told us that there will be a party of 8 sitting next to us and they need the table for them so she moved the table back. The waitress should not have seated us there because their party was ended up to be more than 8 people - there was plenty of seating in the lower area where we could have been seated more comfortably.  Anyway, for appetizers we got the grilled eggplant, fried dumplings and tom yum soup and for entrées - Basil Fried Rice, Shrimp Pad Thai (unable to substitute protein because of lunch special), and Pho Bo. Grilled eggplant was okay, I thought that it didn't have much flavor even with the sauce that it came with, Tom Yum was flavorful and not too spicy, Fried Dumplings were also good with the sweet chili sauce that it came with. Pho Bo was sooo good!! The broth was full of flavor, it's not watered down like some other place that I went to recently. The pho was simple and not too much ingredients which I like, sometimes too much ingredients are overwhelming for me. Shrimp Pad Thai - they did not skimp out on the shrimp, flavorful and yummy. Basil Fried Rice - fragrant with big chunks of sweet bell peppers, also delicious. Service - 7/10, servers were not tentative - we waited at least 5 minutes for them to notice us and to get us our check. Food - 10/10 Definitely will be returning for the Pho Bo, it's perfect for this time of the year!	4star
I think this is the best place to eat near the South Street Seaport. It is a little tucked away but it is well worth the visit.  Order from the Asian fusion menu and you will be pleasantly surprised. The sea bass steak is to die for! Also has great deals on Lobsters and oysters, which tasted fresh as well. Chicken wings and fired rice were very good too.  Highly recommend if you are visiting South Street Seaport.	5star
Just moved into the neighborhood and this place was highly recommend. I'm baffled. Maybe it was an off day. Maybe no one in Brooklyn knows anything about southern food. Maybe I'm cursed.  My food was disgusting. I had the chicken dinner. The most enjoyable part was the pre-packaged dinner roll (delicious). My chicken was over salted, greasy, & either fried twice or fired in dirty oil. The potato salad was bland and had a spongey texture that only comes from spending to many days cooked in a refrigerator.  The mac and cheese tasted like a salt lick topped with cheap margarine and stale Panko. It was completely inedible. I threw it out after two bites. I never throw away mac & cheese.  The meal in it's entirety left me dehydrated and nauseous.	1star
Never again!! Horrible service,  the host have a horrible  attitude,  my first time here and I had such bad experience , I know is a long wait most of the times according  the other reviews, but if you come in put your name down to wait and then get a text about  your table being ready, you come back to the restaurant  to expect  a ready table, I stand there for a good 20 minutes  3 more parties  came after me and were sit first than me. I ask the host  that I was first than everyone else that just came in, to answer me back with an attitud and with a I KNOW!  and that there was a table for me in the back, and that I requested a table. well were did everyone else sit down a table!!didn't  they.End up leaving, never again.  Oh let me not forget  about  the host cursing  out and gossiping  about other  employees in front of the customers waiting	1star
I walk by this place every day on my commute to work, and there is always an aroma of fish outside. I know that sounds bad, but  hear me out: I'm not a fish person, but I always find myself craving fish when I walk by. I finally tried this place out, and it was awesome. The pasta dishes were amazing. As were the meatball, and bruschetta appetizers. I have yet to try the fish, but i hear it's also delicious. Definitely adds a little variety to the pretty limited selection of restaurants in Dumbo. Just beware, this place is a CASH ONLY spot.	5star
+++ - Loved hummus platter. All that bread can be very filling tho ++ - Environment is very hip and cool - I enjoyed the lamb tangine with casablanca   lamb tangine better than chicken tangine + - Servings are pretty big - tangine with charmoulla was alright	4star
So delicious! Burgers and lobster, two of my favorite things! I got the combo option for 1. It was delicious. Next time I come back, I will probably stick to the lobster. It is just so good I can't say no to it. Our server was also fantastic. Great guy, very personable. If you are in the area, definitely come here!	5star
Went here today and my friend had a surprise birthday dinner for me and I enjoyed myself like never before. Staff is super friendly the food is sooooo tasty. They sang happy birthday to me and made my night so special. My only complaint is that when you sit by the kitchen it gets too hot while eating your ramen but it's expected. Besides that I had a great time.	4star
"Wish I could rate this place a zero stars. I used to live above this place and tried to set up an event. The owner was nice and first and said sure. I told her it was an open mic. When I got there right on time with about 15 other people, I asked when could I set up? And the bartender said ""when there done"" in a RUDE SNAPPY voice. I was with my boss, co-workers, and full band. Then the owner comes up to me and says, ""sorry we didn't know there would be instruments, you can't have your open mic here"" after a month of setting everything up, and knowing FULL WELL they have open mics with music every Wednesday- I thought wtf. I was mad, and I expressed it. She was a bitch back. Luckily the LOVELY establishment around the block Juke Bar allowed us to have our open mic there.  After I apologized to her and she was ""blown away that I would be that rude to her at HER restaurant"" first of all bitch, YOU cancelled on me. How rude, I apologized and she didn't apologize back for cancelling last second and being completely rude to me. Anyways, what I'm trying to say is avoid this place, the owners think their shit doesn't stink.  Trust me, I'm not one to write something like this, never have before but damn are they rude and pretentious as fuck."	1star
Me & my friend came here for dinner. Before we went I called the restaurant to make sure theirs room for us on a thursday night. I got there & the place is spacious, elegant & romantic.  They sat us in a nice booth area. Our waitress explains everything about the menu & very helpful in suggesting some food that my friend might want because shes very strict about her diet.  To start off, they gave us a complimentary bread with coconut spread. It was okay. Not that tasty because the coconut tasted so plain.  Appetizer: charred octopus- yukon potatoes, olive tapenade. It was crispy exterior bits while the interior is tender. It has its unique flavor that I like. The potatoes on the side makes it more delicious.  Food: Market green salad w/chicken--beets, radish, pear, papitas, cabernet vinaigrette. This is my friend's food. I don't usually eat salad for my main course but I tried a little of this & it was great! The chicken was very flavorful & all of the ingredients was fresh & crispy. Squid ink linguinne w/prawns-- so this is my food. Wow! I'm impressed. Big serving of food & all in this plate is delicious! The pasta is perfectly cooked & the sauce is spicy that it adds flavor to the meal. Delicious! Overall, it was a great dinner with nice ambiance, quiet place good for dates with nice decor!	4star
Although I'm usually leery of restaurants in the midtown/Times Square area, this place was super chill especially to grab a bite to eat and some drinks with friends. Interior is sleekly decorated and the music was pretty solid. Started with a brown eyed girl which was served in a copper cup with lots of ice...honestly was a little disappointed by the strength as it was a little watered down in my book. Switched to beer after this which was a good decision considering their extensive list of beers on tap.  As for food, the fried eggplant chips are a MUST: slightly sweet (even more so if you dip them in the honey) and fried perfectly. The pork nachos and hummus appetizer were also tasty, though not spectacular. Overall, a place I would go back to if in the area.	4star
Was here yesterday for food and drink. Location is nice and a unique spot on the water to grab oysters and drinks. Others have noted it can get pretty rocky. The oysters were fine as was the soft-shelled crab. Not the best cocktails in the city, but ur paying for the views. Massively let down by the service. The server basically didn't want to serve us for some reason. We sat for about 10 minutes without anyone coming to the table. Then had to ask 5 times if we could order (twice to the bus boy and three times to the assistant server). Each time they said they would get our server, but dude never came.  He'd serve two other tables that sat after us but didn't acknowledge our table. Then finally after about 20 minutes the assistant server took pity on us and took our order (and we got the sense she wasn't actually supposed to). Hats off to her. Other staff were friendly. This is probably a weird one-off incident since other reviewers seem to love this place. But overall, I had a pretty piss poor experience.	2star
We were surprised to find out that there was Chinese and Cuban fusion food so close to our bus stop when we arrived in New York City. Overall, we had a fantastic time catching up with some old friends and enjoyed some great appetizers. We came here just in time for happy hour, and tried some drinks. I really enjoyed the margarita, it was not water down and a nice flavor. The one dollar oysters for happy hour were also a very great find. The garnish that came with the oysters was flavorful, and I think we all agreed oysters very tasty.  It would've been nice to have some space to garnish for the oysters as well, but definitely not a dealbreaker. Speaking of spicy, the shrimp crackers we're very flavorful and the dry spicy salty flakes added a nice kick. For the main course, we had three dishes: The goat Neck, chicken with rice, and duck with rice. All three dishes satisfied our desires of eating tasty food which is also flavorful, and we were happy that the rice was made very well. I would definitely want to get the goat again for sure. The service was very good too, everyone was very attentive and we did not wait for our food for a long time at all.	5star
From the plates to the decor, this is one of the cutest places I've been too. The staff was super friendly and so patient with my indecisiveness. I ordered the waffle Benedict, which came with a side salad and two pieces of God sent bacon. My eggs were a bit over cooked, but the waffles were delicious. The spiked fresh lemonade was freaking good, I would recommend getting it with the peach vodka!	4star
Tried this place because I want to try new things and saw the reviews on Yelp. Came here with a friend for brunch 1 day and I ordered the Lasagna. It was interesting got it because it was a brunch item. Food was good, service was good. Would prob come back again.	3star
This is about as hole-in-the-wall as you can get. It's a tiny little restaurant that's a bit dirty, but I feel like that gives it a kind of authentic and rustic edge.  You're paying $5-6 for a decent-sized bowl of handmade noodles, so don't expect great service - had to wave down a waitress to get her attention and make my order, but my meal was ready in less than 5 minutes.  The broth for the vegetable soup isn't anything special but you can adjust the seasoning at the table, and the noodles are divine. I don't recommend the preserved vegetables with the veggie noodles, but they may be good with the beef noodle soup.  TL; DR: Good, cheap, quick, fresh, and authentic. Don't expect great service.	4star
"I've always heard a ton of great things about the food and drinks in this nifty neighborhood of Brooklyn and was pretty excited to try out what they had to offer! Wife and I ventured out...  Their menu size is perfect - not too cluttered, not too lacking. Often times we would look at two things on the menu and wish that they had particular items that you could mix and match from, but here, I think the pairing done in the kitchen was great.  Everybody seemed to rave about the fried chicken and waffles - you look left, look right, everybody had ordered this. Unfortunately, I wasn't really in a fried food mood and opted out, and went with the salmon dish which was cooked perfectly and their house sauce complimented the dish very well. Could the portion size have been a little bigger? Sure.  Their beer menu is quite extensive as well; however I wish the organization made more sense on the menu, it was all scattered; maybe this was intentional? I ordered ""the uglyduckling"" and by far has to be one of my favorite beers of all time!  Overall, the decor was nice and the price was reasonable; great place to bring a date, especially because there are a ton of dessert places around (or movie theater down the block) to extend your date! I'd definitely come back if in the area to try the fried chicken and beer."	5star
Nice ambience, very helpful bar staff - but the food is a little uneven. Enjoyed crostini with ricotta and honey, but Lamb ribs very overdone - not much edible meat. Brussels sprouts salad nice.	3star
I'm sad to write a two star review for this spot, as I was very excited to go here. There were four of us in the group and we all got the pasta tasting menu.  One of my friends couldn't eat beef for religious purposes and we were shocked that it couldn't be easily accommodated. At first we were told that only one of the dishes can be replaced (even though at least two of them had beef).  After a little more pushing, they finally agreed to give her a beef free tasting, which basically just ended up being completely vegetarian.  Putting that aside, none of us were impressed by the food, we had a lot better in many other Italian spots in the city.  We basically  felt terrible for dropping that much money on this meal and won't be giving it another try.	2star
My friend and I split the ribs from Fletcher's Brooklyn BBQ. For $16 for 4 pieces this was definitely a must avoid. The pieces were dry and I had to keep dipping the ribs in the BBQ sauce to keep it wet.  The ribs were not fall off the bone and I suspect the ribs have been sitting for awhile because there wasn't really a crowd or demand for this here.  The hall as a whole was kind of cool with couple of interesting options. Would try something else next time.	2star
2000+ reviews but there are 545 reviews filtered at the time of this review. Statically these are poor ratios. Why such odd numbers? over 25% I was confused so I visited on a Saturday afternoon to try their lunch. Bottom line, cool decor so-so food. If you are turned on by the boat in the pond you'll love this place andwill not notice to average to low quality food.  The food lack much in terms of Thai flavors. The pad Thai was to over sweeten. The little crispy rolls were lacked substance like taste. I also ordered to whole fish and it came out looking good but was bland and the skin was not clean properly. The top, bottom, around the tail and head of the fish was obviously not cleaned of fish scales. I asked the waiter about it who then went to look for the manager. The manager said sorry but did not offer to cook a new fish or take the dish off the bill. There are so many real Thai restaurant in Queens with much better food.... unless you are just looking for your boat in a pond.	2star
Cheap, fast, authentic, delicious! Enough said! Really tiny place that you could easily miss. They make their signature handpulled noodles and dumplings where you can easily see them. If you're craving beef noodle soup... COME HERE! Come ready with cash. Otherwise, they'll send you over to some random ATM machine across the street.	5star
Really good thin crust pizza, like some of the best Ive had, and a good place to rest tired feet after a long walk. Was kind of disappointed by the lack of air conditioning on such a hot humid summer's day-and the flies which worried me a bit. Nevertheless, the food was great and will definitely return. Ive read that there is usually a long line, but we were seated immediately, maybe because of the broken ac.	4star
My boyfriend and I recommend the Chicken and Rice dish and the 5-Spice Steak Flank! It was a very delicious meal and the atmosphere was very pleasant and romantic. Our server Marvin is funny and very friendly. Definitely come check this place out.	5star
Came here with friends. The outdoor space is nicely designed and adds a great different touch to Astoria. The plates were great for sharing. The burrata was so soft and delicious it deserves separate mention. The other tartine worth to try is the manchengo and shrimp. It is worth a try.	4star
This restaurant is one of the worst Thai restaurant in the city. Not only they don't speak English, they don't even have peanut sauce. The food is sour and tasteless. When we ask to replace one of the tasteless food, they did not replace it. Don't go to this restaurant.	1star
Lively ! Amazing sea food at best rates. Good for people who love spicy food. Great Korean food.  Must try : cheese cake (please see pic)	4star
This is one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. The ambiance, service, and food all get 5 stars from me. The food is always hot and delicious. I'm really picky about saltiness and sweetness, but they always seem to get it right every time. My sister hosted my niece's 100th day celebration here, and we had the upstairs to ourselves--- it was simply amazing! The staff was always coming to check in if we had everything we needed, came to clear our plates and serve us more drinks whenever they saw empty glasses. Five stars well deserved!	5star
"HAIR IN MY SOUP DUMPLINGS. I found this place after I googled ""Best Soup Dumplings in NYC."" I was forced to try this because my favorite soup dumpling spot on Lafayette closed. Which truly breaks my heart. Anyway Shanghai Asian Manor was recommended and I decided to give it a shot, I ordered to go. The dumplings were decent, but there was hair in one of my dumplings and in the dipping sauce. PIECES OF HAIR. Needless this will be the last time I eat there.  Hopefully in the future the hygiene will improve."	2star
Absolutely underwhelming. Took my mom there last night and was so surprised by our experience based on the reviews.  1. Mango salad had such a sour taste. I'm assuming the dressing had too much zest. 2. Calamari and chili sauce was actually great! Kudos there.! 3. Thai Tea had too much milk in it. But the flavor was nice 4. Red snapper in coconut curry sauce. I was so excited to indulge in this. Boy was I disappointed. Snapper had little to no flavor and tasted a little undercooked. The skin was nice though. The coconut curry sauce was just okay. Nothing spectacular. Not much flavor. The vegetables and peppers in the noodles were pretty good EXCEPT for the eggplant. I love eggplant but the eggplant at Joya was simply disgusting. Not to be too gruesome but I immediately regurgitated the eggplant after one bite. I'm not sure if it was frozen for too long or what but it was horrid. 5. Salmon Salad was extremely dry. No real flavor.  6. When we asked for a to go container the waiter gave us a Chinese take out container which could not possibly hold a whole snapper. (I didn't eat much of it so I had a lot of leftovers). I told him it was not large enough so he literally gave me a paper bag as an option to put the food in. Wth. We went back and forth with the waiter for almost 3 minutes trying to convince him to give us an appropriate container. He then spoke to his manager to ask if he could give us a proper container who finally said yes. Why should I ever have to do that? Why does the waiter have to ask for permission to give a container? Ridiculous customer service.  I drove 30 minutes to get to this place and I can confidently say I won't recommend anyone going out of their way to go to Joya. Beautiful decor though. Decent place if you just want quick bites with no flavor. If you're a lover of amazing food, keep searching.	1star
The wait for Ippudo was about 2 hours so we had to settle for this place.  We were a little confused because there are two Totto Ramens right next to each other (I'm not even sure if I'm reviewing the right one).  According to the guy outside  One served tonkotsu ramen and the other served ramen with a chicken broth base.  We decided to go with the tonkotsu since that's what we were all used to and the wait was much shorter. I stuck with the basic tonkotsu ramen, which wasn't bad but I was a little annoyed because it had way too much bean sprouts and green onions.  The broth was a little too salty for my liking but it wasn't too heavy.  You get three thick and fatty pieces of pork which the torch beforehand. The restaurant is pretty small, probably fits about 18 people, so it's pretty hard not to get someone's attention if you need something.	3star
We were looking for a thicker style pizza in NY and came across this place and let me just tell you - this is the best pizza in the city!  It comes as a rectangular pie with square slices.  You can customize the pizza with half red sauce and half white.  If you're in the area - this is a must have!	5star
Mamasita's is pretty small. Happy hour is great for trying all the unique margaritas. Food is decent but nothing to write about. I'd definitely come back to try some more margaritas.	3star

"While I usually stick to places a bit closer to the beaten path, Falansai was chosen by the group I was dining with and I tried to adopt a ""why not?"" attitude.  Getting there from Midtown on a weeknight was surprisingly painless.  Getting back to the Upper East Side afterwards was quicker than I expected it to be.  So far so good.  Getting off the subway in Bushwick, and on the walk down the block to the restaurant I was greeted by a smell that I can only describe as ""fish and garbage"" and then by a huge rat that was not at all afraid of me.  I arrived second in my party and we joked about how I sidestepped that rat like a champ and also how disturbingly normal the fish/garbage smell.  Obviously, these things are not the fault of Falansai, but still not contributing anything positive to my experience. The four of us go inside and are seated right away.  We had a reservation, but even so the place was mostly empty.  We got there just in time for the last 20 minutes of ""happiness hour"".  Not kidding - that's what it said on the menu.  We ordered some drinks (limited beer selection but some strong contenders), summer rolls, imperial rolls, and green papaya salad.  We went on to order a few different kinds of pho as well as the lemongrass tofu as entrees.  My wife got the curry-coconut pho, our friends got the beef and the mole poblano.  I got the lemongrass tofu.  We shared all the apps.  Nothing was spectacular.   The summer rolls were my favorite out of the bunch and I really only ate 1 of them anyway.  Imperial rolls and green papaya salad were forgettable.  Nobody in my party was blown away, but none of us complained that the food was necessarily bad either.  The lemongrass tofu was decent, but very soggy, like the tofu wasn't pressed properly and/or was fried in cold oil.  Very faint lemongrass flavor.  Came with rice, which was a pro.  The pho was super bland.  Those who got the added flavoring were much better off than my friend who the beef.  Everyone agreed that the added flavoring was the *only* flavor in the dish.  None of the food was unpleasant to eat, but it wasn't good either.   The restaurant itself seemed clean and generally put together.  Our server was nice, if a little bit of a mess (couldn't properly stack plates and bowls to carry,etc).  Food wasn't expensive at all.  They played weird fashion movies, projected onto a wall, the entire time we were there. Would I go again?  No.  Am I going to go out of my way to warn people against Falansai?  No.  Leftover feeling: Indifference."	2star
"First, let me start by saying we loved this place when the new ownership took it  over from Locale. Most of the lovely servers from the old guard stayed on, and the ingredients and menu improved, the new owners were there often and attentive and friendly. And there weren't odd rules about reservations or waiting for a table.  Lately this place is just ridiculous. We've lived in the neighborhood since before it opened and have always been satisfied regular patrons. But now ANY time we try to go, the extremely RUDE host/manager (guy with dark hair and glasses) is guarding the door and snarkily asks how many, then we tell him. Then he basically says something along the lines of ""reservation, right?"" (when more than half of the tables appear open) and if we say no he just tosses the menus away and shoots a glare as if we are peons that he can't help. If we ask how long it might be to wait otherwise he rolls his eyes and points at the bar as if it is a dentention center and tells us it's an option. Then turns on his heel and dismisses us.  SERIOUSLY. It is SO disappointing. Everyone here was always so nice and there was never a reservations only policy. If we go now, we make a point to drop in when that guy isn't running the door because it feels like a kick in the gut every time. I've worked in bars and restaurants for many years. This table nazi stuff is such a turn off. Be gracious and sympathetic about it at least if you seriously are so piled up with reservations that there's no way in for a decade. Which come on, I highly doubt is always the case. This isn't the Four Seasons here. This new level of pretentiousness is truly befuddling at this point in the game. This is a neighborhood restaurant. Anyways, still lovers of the food and service otherwise, we went ahead and made a reservation this week. Greeted by the same rude as ever staffer (maybe manager? hard to tell...) again, we say yup, reservation this time (the place was packed as it was Saturday night, so made sense this time) and the only tables open are one right by the door in the middle of the room and two others up in the elevated section. He shows us the worst table (so much for the privilege of making a reservation) and when we ask if we can sit up in the other section he says it's for larger parties. Can't win. So we settle otherwise for the high top bar tables (aka- see above: detention center for folks made to feel dumb for not making a reservation). Fine. The service was great at first, waitress was lovely and friendly and attentive. We ordered. Then a group of people (not a larger party than us) are led to a table we had previously requested and were denied. We wait, and wait, and wait for our food. Nobody coming by to see if we need... um... food we ordered. But meanwhile several items (including menu items that were in our order) are promptly delivered to the table seated after us. Host dude hovering over them, etc...Look, I get it. I've served friends and VIPs at restaurants too. But try not to make it so obvious that service at other tables suffer as a result. Especially when in plain view.  So we wait. Then we ask a very helpful server (not ours, couldn't find her) if the food is coming, she helps, some food comes, other server and good service kick back in again- all great. We finish, plates are slowly cleared. Then nothing. No offer for additional drinks or dessert (they always do here)... No check drop. Nothing. Server is MIA... We turtle neck around the place for about 20 minutes as the host rushes around avoiding eye contact... finally one of us catches him and he drops the check.  What's the deal here? Legit annoyed at the recent changes here. We're loyal, friendly, easy to please, well tipping customers. But seems like a tone is being set- mainly by door guy host manager fella that is just setting up each experience for failure. Ever meet someone who you knew was just looking for a fight? Yeah. Like that.  Meanwhile, we had brunch at a nearby French place on 36th Ave earlier in the day and even in tightly packed quarters with rapidly demanded orders and a BARELY there mess up with a menu item mixed up that took about 20 seconds to correct, and one chef making allll of the orders, the hostess and server were highly attentive, greeted us with friendly attitudes, let us WAIT for a table to open up, and comped some brunch drinks to make up for the slight wait on the item mix up. So now I'm off to write them a glowing 5 star yelp review. UPDATE: Restaurant manager (host referenced above) wrote back a private message defending himself. Apologetic yet unsurprisingly abrasive- Did not address service issues. Not going back, will speak to the owner."	3star
During a 4 day trip to the East Coast this past week, I tried several lobster rolls in Newport, RI and New Haven, CT. Our last stop before jumping on a plane back to Kansas City, we were below the Brooklyn Bridge and stumbled on to Luke's. I ordered the Lobster Roll. The bread was perfectly toasted. There was plenty of lobster meat and it was seasoned to perfection! This was by far the best lobster roll I had!  I don't think there is anything that I would change. Luke's is the real deal!	5star
This is definitely my favorite ramen spot.  Don't come here hungry because depending on the time you go, there is at least a 30-45+ wait. My bf and I came here on a Friday night at around 8:30pm and the place was filled with people - at least 3 groups of 2 already waiting on the benches they have by the windows. We were told that there will be a 45 minute wait so we decided to go to the bar next door and have a drink; came back around 45 minutes later and we were seated.  We decided to try the U&I - I'm not a big fan of uni but this dish was amazing. We were told to eat it like an ice cream and to not mix it. All the flavors went well together.  Their soups are so flavorful and is not packed with msg which makes me chug a cup of water every time I take a bite of my soup and ramen - it's refreshing and tastes very hearty. Only thing is there isn't much protein that comes with it but it's okay because the broth makes up for it. Parking is a little hard to find but it's doable and also very convenient if you take the train.	5star
Cute add to the area and a nice change of pace from the bodegas and fast food abundant strip, and serving up Shanghai street food. There are 4 vegetarian options here: vegetarian steamed dumplings, fried rice, a noodle soup and entree N8. Crispy noodles with vegetables.  I found the dumplings missing that burst of flavor and the dough a bit too heavy and overpowering the filling. The fried rice is tasty but has been salty on the last two occasions.  N8 seems to be my dish since I'm a sucker for crispy noodles. The first time around ordering it, I found it too salty and drowning in sauce and losing all of that crispy noodle goodness. I did want to give it a second try, so I ordered it on my recent visit and asked them to separate the sauce from the noodles leaving me room to control the sauce to noodle ratio. It was so much better. I used less than half of the sauce and it makes for a dish true to the name, crispy!	4star
No longer the restaurant it used to be. I have no idea why it retract all the Xiao Long Bao on the menu. The price goes insane. And the service is absolutely horrible. Worse than the worst you can expect from a Chinese restaurant.	1star
Loved the atmosphere and where our reserved table was when we walked in. Definitely a great little place to have brunch in Dumbo. The staff was super friendly and quick to serve.	4star
Really enjoyed this place. Decent wine selection. Very lovely atmosphere. It wasn't too stuffy. Very chill so it was easy to enjoy ourselves. I can see why many reviews recommend this place for a romantic date. Can be very intimate. The service was nice and attentive. For apps, we ordered the goat cheese sprinkled with black pepper. It was creamy and perfectly flavored. My friend and I ordered the pappardelle al ragu di vitello. Tasted very good. Fresh. I was worried because, when you order meat with your pasta, sometimes it comes out overcooked and dry. The meat was cooked perfectly. I would definitely come here again for a casual dinner to try other things on the menu. (I recommend making a reservation if you are going after 6:00pm. It definitely gets super busy around then.)	5star
Came here last Friday evening for a date night dinner.. I have been here in the past and loved it, but this was not the same experience. Aside from the wait being 40+ minutes at around 8pm, the food we ordered was subpar and so was the service. We ordered the eggplant appetizer, there was barely anything to it and the goat cheese didn't taste fresh. The chicken dinner was more like chicken bruschetta and that's not what it was supposed to be. Our waiter basically pushed us out once he put the check down when we were just having a nice conversation trying to enjoy the remainder of our dinner date. I was disappointed since this place is always awesome, maybe just hit it on a bad night, at least I hope!	3star
BEST. LOBSTER. ROLL. EVER! I fell in love with lobster rolls after coming here and every time I eat there I order 2 or 3 lobsters rolls, lemonade, and chips. Pretty fast, clean but there's not a lot of seating and the lobster rolls are expensive for the little bit.... but it's worth it.	5star
It's just past the fringes of the more popular Park Slope establishments closer to Flatbush, but Seed was a solid, quieter option past the masses. I will say it exceeded my expectations from what I expected, but it did fall under another solid restaurant amongst the multitudes that seem to be popping up in this area and city as our palates become more refined. I will give a shoutout to the large mixed mezze platter which I ordered as a way to be healthy. From the light creamy beets, to the eggplant, carrot salad, sweet rice or pilaf, and the currant stuffed grape leaves (I'm forgetting a couple) ... it was a really great choice that was filling yet not heavy.  If you're in the area, definitely come check it out, because I think lunch here with some specials could be a solid decision.	3star
Food was meh.. they don't offer  ice water or bottled. There's a jug of what looks like 5 day old cucumber water in the front that you have to get yourself. The cups are dirty and the water stunk. It's hot as all hell in here.  I wasn't asked how I wanted my burger cooked  so I bit into it and it was damn near raw.  I called the waiter over to fix the issue. He didn't come directly over he just yelled across from the bar.  He came over and took my plate back to the kitchen. Shortly after he brought it back(mind you I took a bite out of this burger)  they either nuked it in the microwave or took the burger and egg off put them back on the grill then back on the bun.... so now my egg is over cooked and the burger is just gross. I was over it at this point. I'm sitting by here now waiting to leave  told him to split the check. Put her order on her  card then I will pay cash for my order. Waiter couldn't comprehend that. I will not be coming back. Never again.. Update 7 days later.  That food made me and my cousin sick.  My stomach is just now getting back to normal. Definitely do not recommend.	1star
Cool atmosphere but on the pricey side for what you get - desserts was definitely one of the best things here.	4star
"Do not go here. This was the worst restaurant we've been to, from waiting over an hour from appetizer to main dish, to the rudest waitress and manager I've ever interacted with.  My husband ordered plain grilled filet of sole, prepared with olive oil and seasonings.  Instead, he received a dish swimming in a red scampi sauce, topped with mounds of breadcrumbs.  He told the waitress who responded that ""that's the way we do it here"".  Except that's not what we ordered!! She insisted  that he should have told her he didn't want sauce or breadcrumbs, since she didn't know that he didn't.  Yet, what was he point of him ordering what he wanted, isn't that the idea??? That you order he dish the way you want it and that's how you get it!  We asked for manager who told us the same thing and added that we were aggressive and difficult people... because we wanted what we ordered??? No apology and if this is the way they treat people, do not go there.  As well, the noise level is so high you can barely hear yourself speak much less your dining companion.  Repeat, save yourself the trip and Do Not go!!"	1star
"I hate to repeat what many Yelpers say, but I REALLY wanted to love this place. Interesting concept (Korean tapas with a modern twist) at affordable prices... what more can you ask for? Instead, the cuisine here although interesting on paper is rather disappointing. As we say in Italy, ""all smoke, but no roast"".  Make sure to go early, because they don't take reservations. We went on a Saturday afternoon 20 minutes before opening time, and were the first in line. The decor is nice, with plenty of tables for two. A good date spot.  After a quick look at their menu, we realized that they took off their most important item: the eel tacos - pretty much the reason we came here. They ""forgot"" to update their website. The pork belly tacos are also out. Not a good start.  Gnocchi: 9 gnocchi in a sea of boring and overly sweet sauce; spicy. Keep the leftover sauce for the crispy chicken, if you're planning to order it (you'll learn why if you keep reading...).  Edamame dumplings: delicious. By far the ONLY outstanding dish of the meal.  Steak: the meat was very good, but the kale too sour and the grits too bland.  Crispy chicken: not that crispy... the batter was soft and didn't have a particularly tasty flavor. Boring.  Matcha bread pudding: very tasty, although very little serving for $9.  Overall, the place is overrated, with lots of kids overly excited about a quality that simply isn't there.  Our waitress was a tad pretentious, but present. She ""suggested"" that we should order all plates quickly at once, ""because the kitchen gets backed up"", while the only reason is they want you out of there as soon as possible. Instead, we took our sweet time ordering only a couple of dishes at the time, and they ALL came pretty quickly. I want to eat what I order warm, so please don't bs me."	3star
Probably the worst Chinese food experience I've had in awhile. We ordered the crispy fish and two orders of soup dumplings. When you think crispy fish in a chinese restaurant, you don't think breaded and fried fish sticks. Which is basically what we got. The soup dumplings were alright, but nothing to write home about.	1star
Ate in the sister restaurant Maison Pickles, given the recent fire at Jacob's.  Our party of 2 arrived at 11:50 and got seated in 20 min. The service was great, and our waiter was very sweet and checked in on us regularly. The food was INCREDIBLE. We each got our own biscuit sandwiches (I got the honey chicken) with cheesy grits and shared a mac and cheese. The chicken was juicy, the cheesy grits were delicious, the pickles were delightfully tangy and crispy. The mac and cheese was to die for. FYI -- it was definitely too much food for us (the biscuit portion is huge -- the waiter misrepresented that) but I didn't mind because it meant I had delicious leftovers later that day. It was about $28 per person, which is a bit pricey, but the food was incredible. Will definitely be coming back again and again! -- and I do not say this often. Definitely adding this to my go-to list.	5star
Best kept secret of the financial district, apparently. The service here was great! When we both ordered a Guiness on a cold day, the manager himself ensured that they weren't flat. The food was solid and it wasn't too crowded.	4star
Luke's (Brooklyn) bests Red Hook Lobster Pound. 1. Roll is not drowned in 'buttah' 2. Meat was tastier 3. Cheaper by $3  Sorry, RHLP - hello Luke's :)	5star
I haven't had Xiao Long Bao for a while and went on a quest to find some in Chinatown.  I got the Pork ones and they were soo good.  The skin is thin and only a couple had leaks in it.  The broth was very flavorful without being salty.  I also picked up some scallion pancakes and they were thin and crispy. I mean very crispy.  One of the crispiest I've eaten without being burnt.  The restaurant is very roomy and I wouldn't consider it a hole in the wall, but it had prices of it.  I would go back to try their other dishes.	4star
Pig and Khao is a unique Filipino fusion restaurant with influences of Thai and Vietnamese cuisine. It is located in LES, surrounded by various hipster restaurants and cafes, so, in honesty, can be overlooked. However, I am in the quest of trying out as much Filipino spots as possible; I was happy to find Pig and Khao.  I first came here on a Friday night to meet up a friend. This place is not entirely great for deep convos as the ambience is very loud and the music can overshadow voices. It can definitely build the mood of a fun weekend out in the city.  Food is great: not too heavy on the menu with super Pinot foods, but sisig is a definite number one here as this restaurant is made for both first-timers and those already familiar with this Southeast Asian cuisine. Pig and Khao incorporates additional ethnic dishes such as Thai and Vietnamese. Don't expect too much comfort foods if you are expecting mama's home cooking. They also serve desserts like typical halo halo, etc. Definitely a great spot if you feel like showing off your people's food or bringing a date. ;) By the way- ube!  Prices are reasonable for the location which is similar to places like Maharlika, Jeepney, etc. I enjoyed their cocktails here in which they incorporated some SEA flavors too. However, whenever I come here, I will usually opt for a Red Horse!  Space in here can get cramped. I actually enjoy it as it gives the place a casual intimacy. Decor is cute and lighting is super dim. The bathrooms are pretty spacious and clean but there is only one, which maybe a bad thing as you may wait on a line for a couple of minutes! Accepts card and open late. Service is good and quick. Doooooope!	4star
Super surprised this place has four stars.  It's exceptionally bad. We got drinks there.  Margaritas and mojitos to be specific.  And they were so sugary, and so cheaply made.  They were markedly bad. We then sat down to dinner.  The food's pretty decent, but SUPER overpriced for what they serve.  Save yourself the trouble of an annoying night and go elsewhere.	2star
"Melba's definitely has it going on more for dinner than for brunch - at least as far as the eggnog waffles and turkey sausage goes. Had brunch with the wife today and was looking forward to the eggnog waffle and turkey sausage. The wife had the omelet special which for today happened to be the collard green omelet which came with potatoes. The verdict on the waffle is that while it had the flavor of eggnog present, the consistency of the waffle's texture was more dense than I'd prefer. Combined with the artificial syrup (some came heated, the remaining syrup didn't), the waffle required additional syrup to keep from turning into a dense dough ball in my mouth. I only finished 3/4 of the waffle. For an established restaurant looking to feature waffles (and pancakes too), real maple syrup goes a long way (their strawberry butter takes the dish halfway (maybe even 2/3 way) there). The turkey sausage was not much better. it was one dry link cut lengthwise. Period. My wife described her omelet as follows, ""it was what you'd expect. The collard flavor was good, but I was hoping for some extra something - spice in the egg, peppers, onions - something."" her turkey bacon was also ""meh"". The service was pretty good. Our server was polite, attentive and answered all of our questions. So four stars for dinner, but only two stars for brunch. We'll stick to Amy Ruth's and Billie's Black for brunch for now."	2star
Five things you need to know about brunch at SoCo: 1. They take reservations.  2. A Yelp check-in for free corn bread (one order) yields you 3 servings. A perfect amuse-bouche! 3. Winning entrees: The grits dishes, the pulled pork hoagie, and the chicken with red-velvet waffle.  4. Gratuity is included for parties larger than 2 - be cautioned so you don't miss that (it can happen after you have oh, one or five sangrias.  5. Pick up some bagels at Bergen Bagels on your way out, 'cause you know you're going to sink into a food coma post-brunch and be starving later.  xo.	4star
Delicious authentic Mexican food done fast food style.  With the toppings, it all comes together so well.  Juicy, tasty and satisfying :)  Prices range from $3.50 - $4.75 per item (well worth it).	5star
"Stopped by with our cousins and kids last week after a long day hiking and biking Governor's Island. We weren't starving but figured sharing a quick meal together to cap the day would be cool, esp. with kids in tow. Our party of 7 were seated at a large, raised table within a couple of minutes of entering. 1st impression was that this was a slightly upscale/trendy spot, particularly due to the fairly dim lighting and narrow quarters. As such, I was expecting to pay a bit more for what we would get (and it ended up I wasn't wrong). Since we weren't that hungry, we opted to start with a single pie and add on to our order as needed. We ordered an Old Fashioned (10-slice rectangular) pie that started off at around $25. We opted for 1/2 of it to be plain and on the other 1/2 we asked for onions, roasted peppers, pepperoni, and sausage. With all the toppings added on, the price swelled to closer to nearly $40. The flavors were good but the crust wasn't crispy or thin, which may be a big downer for crispy crust fans. It was chewy but I won't kill them for it.  One odd thing was that the water they served us was barely cool. No ice at all. Unsure why that was the case. Also, our server didn't seem particularly pleased with our ""small"" order but she could have done a better job of hiding her disdain. For one, you want return customers. Secondly, you'd would want to increase your chances of getting a larger tip as a result of your friendliness and service.  I'd stop by Adrienne's if I'm back in the area but I'd stop short of calling them a ""must try"" spot. I'd give them closer to 3.5 stars but will generously round up to 4."	4star
My friend and I decided to come here for dinner after Broadway on Martin Luther King Jr day (Monday). We got here around 5:25pm and noticed couple of people waiting front of the door. They were about to open. You have to sign up on a list to get seated in order.  My friend And I didn't make it to the cut line. It's literally a hole in the wall kind of place. The host let us look at the menu. She said it'll be a 30 min wait. By 6pm, we had ordered and got called in to sit down. We got a table which we were relieved of. We didn't want to sit at the bar table because you had to sit on a stool. It was cold too so we were grateful to get seats inside right by the register table. My friend and I found the ramen soup very thick and rich in fat. She had the mega paitan so her bowl was bigger than mine. She ate the whole thing but said halfway point it's pretty greasy and heavy, and kinda bland.  I found the pork char siu meat itself very oily and fatty. I would recommend pulled chicken/pork spicy ramen unless you love thick pork belly fats. :)  And I thought I was a meat lover! These regular customers def love meat more than me! Haha	3star
No minimum for delivery is great, but their chicken is not good anymore. It tastes like as if they do not pre-salted chickens. So basically they just fry chicken and put sauce over it. Sauce tastes good but then chicken it so bland. I ordered their spicy rice cake with noodles and noodles tasted like rotten.	2star
I tried this spot for the first time.  It was not good.  Part of the reason I went here was the $9 pasta.  The other reason is the spate of good reviews. I think the reason for the good reviews is the $9 pasta.  This seems to be the cheapest around.  What was not good, to my taste, was the pasta.  They claim it is homemade.  Fair enough, but the shape looked like RAMEN NOODLES.  The portion size is about the size of a bowl of oatmeal (medium sized soup tureens).  They serve beverages in mason jars. This includes beer and water.  The time I went, they forgot to put ice in the water and the weather was in the low 70's and humid at 9:30pm on a weeknight.   The service is pleasant with a young and hip looking staff that address you as 'man' or dude.   The flavour profile on their bolognese was off.  It tasted as if there was too much animal fat rendered into it and whatever it was left a gamy flavour for me (veal?  venison?).  I also thought their salt to taste quotient was a hair over too much (personal taste).  The ambience on an East Village weeknight was L-O-U-D.  I also thought the need to turn tables (quickly?) undermines the rusticity they imply in their website.  This spot is not a place to take a first/second/third date.  Too L-O-U-D.  The $9 pasta was just for that entree.  Nothing comes with it.  This is a strictly a la carte establishment where you add on things to your menu.  For example, the aforementioned Bolognese 'ramen' arrived with the $4 meatball addition (3 meatballs == $1.333 per meatball) that, to me, looked to be about the size of what you get at the Ikea restaurant:  Swedish meatball style.  This had an unusual flavour as well.  The texture reminded me of a slightly smoother falafel and the taste, to me, was oddly like, well, the Ikea meatballs but with a soy undercurrent.  Interesting.  There is no bread service: look at the menu. They charge for the bread and pretty much anything else you want to add to your meal.  Weak.  In any case, I won't be back and I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone lest you spend more money than at a S'barro for a small pasta, which, frankly, does the same job for nearly the same price (really, cheaper than San Marzano).	1star
The food here is absolutely delicious, but I'm not sure whether they use MSG or not. I had the Khao Soi (curry noodle), and it was delicious. However, I was VERY thirsty afterwards for like 8 hours and drank a lot of water. Not sure if it's from Obao, but everything else I ate that day was the same as my mom, and she wasn't thirsty at all so I think it was the Khao Soi. My mom got the curry duck entree, which she really liked. We also shared the Spare Ribs On Sugar Cane Skewer, and that was really delicious too. I wish they had put more meat on the skewer, but the taste was on point. Service... oh the service. I hadn't even finished my dish, and the waiter was about to take my plate. I had to tell him I wasn't done yet. Then when I put the last spoonful in my mouth and haven't even chewed the food, the waiter came back again and took my plate away. Like darling, what's the hurry? There are so many tables open yet and it isn't even lunch/dinner rush hour. It left me in quite an agitated and unsatisfied mood. Overall good food, but a lot of room for improvement in terms of service and quality of food.	3star
"Delicious! My husband and I came on a Saturday night and was quoted an hour wait at 7:30pm! Who knew that there would be crazy lines! We both ordered The Monster 50/50 sandwich: Brisket & pulled pork combo with onions, pickles, coleslaw, BBQ & habanero sauce -- it was delicious! We also had some small corn on the cob and Grandma's apple cake. I also tried the ""Old Fashioned Apple Pie"" cocktail - LOVED it - it has moonshine, muddled cherries, oranges, bitters and a dash of Cinnamon and tastes just like an apple pie. Was this meal worth the thousands of calories? LOL YES!!!!! We'll be back :)"	4star
The worst service ever! Be ready to get attitude and get insulted with the main dish! Again, the worst people ever!!! RUDE!	1star
"If you are visiting New York, this place might seem like a good place to hit up to quench your lobster roll craving. I would avoid it. Pretty blatant tourist trap. I ordered their special trio; a lobster roll, shrimp roll and crab roll. Both the shrimp roll and crab roll were too salty. If you have a heart condition...avoid those. The lobster roll was good though. The bread is soft and buttery, they should just sell that by itself...but not at the prices that they charge. For $20, you get 3 ~3"" rolls that might last you two bites if you're lucky. Make sure to have a backup food place bookmarked cause you will be going home hungry otherwise. Maybe hit up that Shake Shack across the street. TL;DR Decent rolls that are a bit too salty, overpriced and small"	2star
I came here with some co-workers for happy hour a few months back. The food was good and there were options for vegetarian and vegans. The service was great and our waitress was so nice. They even gave us a free round of shots. I had the apple pie moonshine and loved it!	4star
Lovely decor but the good stops there.  Seriously, go to Ethos or Estiatorio or any other swanky, corporate, overpriced midtown Mediterranean spot within a 10-block radius instead. Food: the only items I'd order again are the tuna tartare and meatballs, which were average. The prosciutto in the fig and prosciutto salad tasted like it came from a supermarket package; it was also overdressed. Octopus was tender but not crisped on the outside. Spreads came with cold pita (if grilled, it must have been sitting out for ages in the kitchen). Chicken skewer was nearly raw. My dining companion literally took 2 bites of his salmon burger and called it a day. Service: what a nightmare. Despite having a reservation, my party had to wait in the bottleneck of the hostess area for ages. There were at least 5 employees huddled around there, clearly unclear which tables were cleared and ready for seating. During the meal, we had to hail down the server on multiple occasions.  Hard pass.	1star
This place is basic and simple. Me, my partner and my sister came in for brunch. I ordered the scrambled eggs with a side salad and toast. My partner ordered scrambled eggs with potatoes and my sister ordered the pancakes.  Scrambled eggs with side salad and toast:  eggs were literally just scrambled eggs nothing special. Tasted like cafeteria style eggs. Nothing in it but eggs. Problem is half my plate was bread. The side salad was actually pretty good because it had the dressing already mixed in. Tasted very fresh.  Scrambled eggs with potatoes: my partner said he liked it but agreed they were nothing special. Half of his plate was bread too. That's annoying.  Pancakes: my sister also had the same reaction to her pancakes. They were seriously just basic buttermilk pancakes with honey on the side. The kind you can make at home  Coffee: good and fresh and hot and large mugs  Atmosphere: from the outside you can easily miss this place but from the inside this place looks amazing. Super cute and trendy looking and the bar area is elevated from the rest of the resturant. I can see this place being a good date spot.  Service: quick. Server was friendly and attentive.  Parking: street parking Price: about average Overall experience: not bad. Basic place for brunch with simple food items. Food tastes good but not restaurant quality as every item we ordered literally tasted basic.  Won't come back here for brunch. There are too many other places in Brooklyn with amazing brunch options.	3star
It fills up quick. I like the indoor outdoor vibe. I was pleasantly surprised that the blackened catfish had so much flavor. The greens were good, added hot sauce but wish they were cut up. I was disappointed with the parings. I wanted certain meats with certain sides and you couldn't make changes, even if there had been an upcharge. I'd go again I wanted to try their brunch.	3star
Do you like huge prices for very small amounts of food? Then you'll love it here. The food is fine. It's really nothing special. But please be warned: you will spend a very large amount of money for a very small amount of standard Brooklyn-type food.	1star
Came in on a Thursday night after work, luckily my friends were here and grabbed a table as there are no reservations and the wait outside was quite large.  We got the dumplings, clams with potato noodles, seafood pancake, cold chili noodles and bimbimbap. The food was all flavorful with decent portions (the dumplings were quite small). The prices are very reasonable for a hip-ish new Korean place in New York. **MINUS 1 star for them kicking us out. We finished and were told to leave by the hostess. Kind of rude IMO.	3star
Despite the hours listed on our lovely Yelp page here, Amy Ruth's offers a late night menu.  So this was exactly where I was headed one Saturday night when my party options didn't turn out as planned.   The late night menu had exactly what you'd hope for: carb-loading options and fulfilling protein options.  Lots of [item of choice here] and waffles, standard breakfast items and some sandwiches.  My party got chicken and waffles and strawberries and waffles.  The chicken was great and the portions were very satisfying.   At 3am, the service isn't perfect since there was one (and a possible second) waiter.  But if you're already there are 3 am like I was, then chances are you aren't in a rush to go anywhere else (other than your bed).  So it was fine until we needed to get the check at which point the waiter was relatively easy to flag. I'm definitely happy to have another great late-night eats place in mind.	4star
This place has such great ambiance that I almost wanted to nap right after... so I may be more biased than most of the other reviews only because I grew up eating Middle eastern food whether it be egyptian, Lebanese, and Turkish...my diverse family allowed me to experience all of it. I didn't hate my dishes but I didn't love it either it was just okay. The duck Shawerma is always my favorite but this had too much cinnamon in it I wouldn't order it again as it wasn't right. The tuna tartare was perfect but that's not even something you'd see in most Arabic restaurants...so I didn't count it when rating the Arabic food. The mixed grill wasn't memorable but I do remember how dry my chicken was and if marinated right it shouldn't be. My boyfriend enjoyed everything but the shawerma...it was his first time eating Lebanese so he didn't know how things could taste vs. What he tasted. I would prob come here for drinks and apps....not for dinner, the service was good at least.	3star
Loved coming here for dumplings, but the don't have them anymore. The rest of their food is pretty mediocre. Was thoroughly disappointed.	1star
This place is a mix between buffet options that you can get by the pound or premade boxes and snacks. We went with the buffet option because there were a lot of different things we could try. I will say: the major pros of this place is the price (about $8/lb) and the great variety of hot and cold options. The cons is that, like any buffet, it's hard to make the food consistently good and fresh. I liked the sushi and the seaweed salad (made in the Korean style as opposed to Japanese), as well as the japchae. The meat, however, was not that well done and was thick and dry (the stewed chicken and vegetables wrapped in beef). Overall I thought the quality was about average, but the value in the price is probably what makes this place popular. Of all the excellent options in ktown, however, not sure I would come again.	3star
What I miss most about my old house in the burbs was proximity to great taco spots. This is no different. The only reason they dont get 5 stars is because they are a bit expensive for a small taco.  When you go, get their special taco. This is a deep fried version and resembles almost an empanada. It still has all the fillings one would enjoy, but fried. Who doesnt like fried? If you are on a diet, then take a day off and order the fried anyways. Worth it!	4star
The food was not bad, except the salad which was extremely salty. It also took an hour to get the last dish even though they were all supposed to come out whenever they were ready	3star
Check in on Yelp and get the buy one egg and get another egg free offer !!  BEST Bahn Mi place in Queens ever! All their sandwiches are so delicious, there is no way you cannot like it. AND the workers are so polite and generous :) The place is small and it gets crowded during lunch time. Parking can get really hectic in the area; I usually park two to three blocks away and walk over which honestly is not bad at all. You need to walk off these awesome bahn mi sandwiches and fries afterward. Believe me, you'll want to stuff your face because it's amazing.  I usually get the Joju Deluxe and/or Lemongrass Chicken, thai ice tea, and the loaded bahn mi fries. ALL OF THESE ARE A MUST TRY! Their sandwiches is simply great. MUST ADD AN EGG IN YOUR SANDWICH ALSO!! Inside the sandwiches, it usually comes with carrots, cilantros, pickled radish, and jalapenos if you want it spicy. They can accommodate to the level of spiciness you like because they have different level of spice. Pretty cool huh?!  Their loaded bahn mi fries is awesome as well. I always ask for runny eggs; they're the best. The loaded bahn mi fries has cilantro, spicy mayo, and egg. My friends ordered the kimchi fries and they were raving about how great those fries are. I'm not a big kimchi fan, so I didn't really try it. But if you are, definitely give that a try! Overall, I really love this place. I can come back for their sandwiches every day if possible. It is super filling and inexpensive! ANOTHER PLUS: There is no minimum charges for credit card! How awesome! My friend brought a can of soda and she was allowed to charged that with her card ;)	5star
We came here for weekday brunch to avoid the long waits they normally have on the weekdays. The place is cute and quaint with an open-air space. My breakfast bowl was yummy and a good portion (with eggs, quinoa, kale and spaghetti squash.) The hubby had a Madame Freda (grilled cheese, duck, and eggs) which was heavier but really tasty.  Our server and the hostess were great.  Not sure it's worth the long weekend wait for, so come on a weekday if you can!	4star
I was pretty excited to check this place out. Food wise, it was very enjoyable.  Cute, cozy atmosphere.  Service wise - Disappointing pretty much sums it up. We were sat and went a good big of time before anyone came over to wait on us.  When he did, he seemed excessively aloof and unconcerned about actually having to wait on tables. It almost seemed offensive that we asked if they had any happy hour specials, which they did have a decent happy hour on wine.   Too bad we didn't get to order more than one from having our sever not come around to check if we wanted another, and from the amount of time it took for him to show up in the first place.  The restaurant was no where near busy and our server was gone for extended periods of time. Good thing we weren't in any hurry. Food - four star at least.	3star
Actually came to this establishment on Easter Sunday in the afternoon, but didn't end up getting inside until the evening. The wait over 60 min wait time was definitely a turn off. Once we entered,  I had white the change of heart. Our waiter was attentive and our meals were served in a timely manner. The fried chicken was pretty delicious and their drinks are strong. On top of that you get a great portion for the (reasonable) price that you pay. Don't see myself coming back for a second time.	3star
What a letdown.  Got the burata to start, tiny and no flavor. The bread w pesto wasnt very good either. The grilled octopus was ok, nothing special. The gnocchi ragu was also ok but nothing special. The service was terrible, took 30 min to receive our cocktails.  For entrees i got the striped bass, it was served in a mushroom sauce. The bass was fishy, the broth tasted like hot water and dirt. I am shocked they sent that dish out it was disgusting. We also go the lamb chops which were edible but quite strong and gamy.  We ordered drinks and dessert for our friends birthday and the desserts came out and were finished before anyone got their after dinner drinks or espresso. Unacceptable.  What a total ripoff, sub par food and service for a top dollar price. Would not recommend anyone wasting their time or money coming here very disappointed.	2star
If I were rich, I would eat here every day. Jonathan is the embodiment of jack of all trades and master of some. The food and drinks are not only amazing but the service is top notch.  Get this, the bartenders are also your waiters! They are on top of their game though as they geniusly know how to multi task and never have you feeling neglected! No place in Sunnyside is packed to the seams the entire time they are open, Monday through Sunday, like Alcove. That alone says it all and concur with the other reviews regarding the outstanding food and drinks.	5star
Asea is not the best Japanese retaurant i've had but it's certainly a cut above the rest. The sushi is definitely fresh, and the yakitori is done well. There's of course alcohol served here so thats a plus. Tried the beef, scallop and bacon, and chicken, yakitori and it was pretty good. Not many places serve that along 8th Ave so it was nice. The sushi was nice and fresh, and their Kani salad was pretty good. I would actually go here more if it wasn't so out of place for me. I would definitely come back though and with a bigger group of friends (more than 3) to try more of their food.	3star
The decor reminded me of a episode of the simpsons. Over priced with tiny portions. Went to eat pizza across the street because I was still hungry after eating from here. What a ripoff do your self a favor, LOOK ELSEWHERE!!	1star
The setting is great and they've done a wonderful job with enclosing the back room.  Unfortunately, thats about all I've got. We went for my birthday dinner and the waitress was incredibly rude about it being my birthday- saying oh I don't like birthdays and walking away.  The food was uninspired.  The duck two ways didn't taste like duck after  so much sauce was added. The scotch egg had way too much sausage.  And nothing was particularly memorable.  I know this place is new and working out kinks, so maybe it will get better.	2star
"If you like flavorful food, don't come here. I'm embarrassed I made my friend come try this ""famous"" chicken with me. It was sooooo dry and lacked real depth of flavor. I couldn't believe I was eating the famous JW chicken. I've had better roast chicken at PioPio."	2star
"Contempt for customers seeps from every pore of the staffs' bodies. As our beloved president would tweet, ""Terrible."""	1star
Sooo I went here because I was super hungry before my shift and decided to get some fried chicken since TuTus doesn't start dinner service until 6. I was in the mood for some fried chicken, but after going here I wish I wasn't. I started with some fries with spicy seasoning that was far from spicy. I sat at the bar was not given a napkin, for or anything when  got my fries by the way. No salt, pepper, ketchup it was like I was almost invisible. Once my fried chicken came out the bartender finally gave me something to eat with, thank God. But once I bit into the over fried flavorless chicken I knew I would be disappointed. It tasted like old fryer grease and was seasoned at all. Last time I check people usually season meat, right? The best part of my meal were the mashed potatoes that came as a side. I took two more bites of the chicken tried to flavor it with the salt and pepper that was given to me , but even that didn't help. I asked for my check and got out there as fast as I could. The only good thing about my experience here was the music. But I can listen to that on my iPhone. I'll never go here again.	1star
Simple quick and healthy-ish, what more do you need?   A little on the pricey side like all of NYC, simple breakfast for two with coffee was over $40.   Don't really care for communal seating on the bench in the middle of the restaurant because it's hard to get in and out of when swinging of legs is required without hitting your too close for comfort neighbor.... Get the hot sauce it's fantastic.	3star
This is as close to China as you'll get without a plane ticket.  It's all about cheap, fast, and delicious food. You come here for the food, not for the dining experience, although I'd still say I quite liked my experience here. It's a small hole in the wall shop that seats about 15 people at once. You head towards the back of the store and give your order to the ladies making the dumplings before grabbing a seat.  Get the pork and chives dumplings here. They're the best and super cheap. Dumpling skin is thin and filling is juicy and delicious. What's more? Try the chili oil. It tastes amazing and adds another dimension of flavor to the dumplings. I can never eat the dumplings without it. There's more. What? It only costs you $3 for all 10 dumplings. You can even get a bag of frozen ones to take home. I also tried the oxtail soup noodles here and it's delicious. The fan favorites seem to be the beef noodle soup and zha jiang mian - I'll be back to try these. Again, don't forget to add the chili oil, they're nice with the noodles too!	5star
Not once were we checked on by the waitress or the manager, until he brought the check. Please don't act like your manager was innocent because he spoke to us rudely when I initially questioned the automatic gratuity nicely. He asked for feedback and I spoke honestly but nicely about our disappointment.  For example, at one point 20 min after my friend ordered her first drink not one person who worked at the restaurant was anywhere to be seen. 10 minutes later, still no one to be seen and no drink. Our glasses were empty for most of our meal, water glasses and margarita glasses.  Your manager was the one that escalated the situation when he spoke to me the way he did and I told him it was inappropriate. Please get your story straight and staff in order. Your manager is aggressive.	1star
Even on a rainy, gross winter night, Rubirosa was PACKED to the gills. On the outskirts of Little Italy in Nolita, is the extremely popular, cute, fun, well-known pizza spot overflowing with hungry pizza lovers!  You definitely need a reservation here - either that or plan on waiting a while. The restaurant is tightly packed with tables, and the bar (although long), didn't seem like a place I would want to sit. It was crowded and tight when guests and staff walked by, seemed like it might be annoying.  Luckily, we were seated all the way in the back, away from majority of the chaos!  Having come with seasoned professionals, who had their preferences for ordering, they let us who hadn't been choose what we wanted (based on recommendations, of course). After ordering a very reasonably priced bottle of red wine, we settled on 2 salads, meatballs (highly recommended) and 2 pizzas (1 large, 1 small). We ordered roasted beets salad & arugula salad, the tie dye pie & fresca pie.  The food came out quickly - the pies straight from the oven! (currently wishing I was the one who took home the 3 leftover slices) Everything was delicious, and I would do it all over again. The service was good, not amazing, but it really was a zoo in the restaurant, so I won't judge that harshly. Can't wait to return and try more delicious looking items on the menu! Better make my reservation now!	4star
I gave Peaches Hothouse another chance recently and I am happy I did.  The wait for brunch around 2pm on a Sunday was long, but it gave me ample time to catch up with my good friend.   Eventually we were seated at the bar, and decided to order the chicken and share some sides.  She got an order of regular fried chicken and I got the medium spicy chicken.  The chicken was fried perfectly!  The right amount of crisp on the outside with tender, seasoned meat on the inside.  I even enjoyed the breast piece, which I don't usually prefer, but this piece was moist and delicious as well.  perfect.   For sides, we shared the kale, fries,  and potato salad.  The kale was well seasoned and tasty, the fries didn't look like much but were quite good and the potato salad with bits of bacon was amazing!  I forget the name of the drink we had, everyone at the bar was drinking it, but I enjoyed it as well.  It was potent and a little sweet, pretty good. Peaches HotHouse is a small spot with good food.  It is perfect for brunch or a dinner with a small group of friends or even a date.  There's a bar, so I would definitely return solo for some good eats and a drink.	4star
At first I booked for Restaurant Week brunch but arrived late. Luckily they still had rooms for walk-ins so we were seated right away. First thing first this place is located quite far from the subway so it would be a bit of a walk (especially when you're hangry).  The restaurant week menu is $29 for brunch. Grandma Biscuit was served first with sesame seed and salted honey (?) sauce. The texture was very moist, a good start. Drunked Deviled Eggs came afterward. I think the stuffing was delicious and the beet colored egg white was nice to try. For entree, I obviously went for Fried Chicken Waffle Sandwich since it's one of my favorite dishes. Honestly, I'd prefer the fried chicken at Sweet Chick (another Southern spot), which is more savory and crunchy. Their buckwheat waffle was perfect tho, so soft and airy inside. My bf didn't order the restaurant week menu because he wanted Shrimp & Grits. Good choice! The sauce is amazing with lots of shrimp, sauteed onions, and corn. Even tho it might be a bit overwhelming to eat the whole dish since the grits are very buttery.  This next dish seriously had me at ftw: chilled watermelon with jalapeno, onion, basil and lime vinegarette. You know when you have a watermelon bowl, you put it in the fridge without a lid or a cover when you also have onion or other food in there and the smell transfers to the watermelon? There, that's exactly how it tastes like.  I say it's not worth the hype and the constant check for opening slots for days...I don't care if the chef is famous or what I just speak of my honest experience. Maybe I need to come back and try the fried bird bucket?	3star
Every time I'm in the area I always stop at Robertas. The wait is extremely long but the pizza is extremely good. I always get the pizza that has the most meat on it and every pizza is served piping hot. I am never lucky to land a seat inside due to the small space so I always end up grabbing takeout and eating in the outdoor patio next door. Every time I go the pizza never disappoints, so be sure to walk with a hungry belly and a fat wallet. Good pizza is not cheap...	5star
Awful experience (the waitress is the only reason I am not giving 1 star)  I was really disappointed by our experience at Hendrik's. After seeing a good rating on several websites including Open Table and Yelp, I decided to make a reservation here for my mom's birthday. While the restaurant had a nice vibe overall, we were seated at the table right by the door & front window which made it feel as though we were being watched more than anything. We ordered a salad to share, which we specifically requested to be an appetizer, and it came about 5 minutes after we received our drinks. Not 2 minutes after the salad was put down were our plate being thrown down in front of us. It all felt extremely rushed - not the nice relaxed evening we were expecting. By the time we finished the salad, our food had cooled down considerably. I ordered butternut squash ravioli, which was pretty good but needed more cheese, apples, and cranberries (the topping). My sister ordered the rosemary gnocchi which was had maybe a tablespoon of sauce in the bottom of the bowl. Even with extra sauce, the dish was very one-dimensional. My dad ordered the smoked salmon pasta, which was probably the best of the 4, and my mom ordered the lobster risotto. I don't know about you, but when I read lobster risotto, I have pretty high expectations. To be honest, it was one of the reasons I chose the restaurant in the first place. Unfortunately, this was by far the worst part of the meal. I have had many risotto dishes before, and this was simply white sticky rice with some sort of sauce on top. It was EXTREMELY bland and so disappointing that my mom even asked them to take it off of the bill.  Our waitress was very pleasant and tried to reconcile the meal by bringing a birthday desert for my mom, but overall I was super disappointed. There are too many good restaurants in NYC to have this type of experience.	2star
These two stars are mostly because of the awful service. I generally don't rate a place low for mediocre or even poor service, but the service here was basically non existent so I'm making an exception. The hostess/waitress seated us and took our drink order. 15 minutes later. I'm patient. That's ok. It was fairly busy. She said she'd bring us the dinner menu at 5 because that's when they start serving dinner. It was 4:30. No biggie--we (almost) have drinks! Drinks took about 15 minutes to come out. I took my time sipping and chatted with my husband. With drinks done and a request in for the dinner menu, we watched as the place cleared out, people were seated and some even received food. No menu, no check, no water, not even a glance for almost 50 minutes. We tried to get her attention with handwaving and the usual signals, but she was chatting with another table for a very long time. Then suddenly she became very concerned with rearranging a try of glasses. Good thing she didn't look up because she would've seen a lot of annoyed customers. The people next to us also got no service for about the same amount of time but they stuck it out.  Wish I found out if the food is still as good as it was last time I went. We finally left the money we knew we owed and walked out, which--admittedly--we should've done sooner.	2star
Just had Sunday dinner. This place is Something out of diners drive ins and dives in terms of portion size, deliciousness, and just pure creativity. Service was stellar and timely, definitely recommend the park burger, buffalo dip, bread pudding. Would of gave it 5 stars but the bathroom was a mess when I walked in.	4star
I've been here a few times.  Wings are great.  Entrees are meh.  They bring out sparklers with enthusiasm.  Chef gave cupcakes for a friend's birthday.  Drinks are great. Petra is nice, but a trash waitress.	3star
Wonderful food, terrific service and a fun atmosphere.  Really a treat. Had the Frutti de Mare pasta, and it was quite fresh and delicious.  Generous portions.  Been here a few times, and they are very welcoming and accommodating. We were celebrating a milestone birthday, and the staff really belted out a memorable rendition of Happy Birthday.  Also, owner waved any corkage.  Previously, we had a request for wheelchair access, and they graciously opened up the side entrance and moved tables to make it accessible for our elderly uncle.   Everyone had a fun time and was well fed.	5star
Hands down best barbecue and barbecue sauce in New York (if not probably I have ever had) the environment is incredible with outdoor seating. The bar has great Whiskey, the taps are  Decorated with butchers knives, the bar lights are old phonographs, and the bar has an old school butcher shop setting to it. Baked beans and burnt ends is definitely the side to get. The barbecue is served on a baking sheet by the pound (1/4 of a pound is the smallest portion you can get) what more would you want!	5star
"Such a disappointment. We ordered the jerk chicken, jerk ribs, and corn. The corn was cold and bland, the chicken was dry, and the ribs were just okay. Tossing cole slaw in vinegar does not make it pickled. The rice was mushy and flavorless.  We were really looking forward to authentic Caribbean food as we had heard this was ""the spot"". We have both traveled and eaten our way through the Caribbean and this is absolutely not anything close to an accurate depiction of the culinary culture. At. All.  Even the drinks were lackluster. DO THE RUM PUNCH SOME JUSTICE.  We left upset with wasting our time and money.  Sorry, Pearl's, it's a no-go."	1star
The ribs were good, however my gripe with them is the complete lack of good sides, you have your choice coleslaw, pickles and deviled eggs. And when you order them they come in a pre-packaged plastic box. They are expensive and not worth it.	1star
The night time bartender (last Friday) was pretty rude to my friend. I don't know if she was having a bad day but she seemed to lack basic social skills and had no tact while addressing us. We found that pretty strange considering we are paying customers and at no point returned the attitude. The food however (close to closing time) was Ahh- mazing. I love Black Tap not just for their shakes but for their burgers as well, they are one of the best I've had and I can't wait to go back (when she's not there). Anyway, 2 stars off for her and that terrible attitude.	3star
I absolutely love this place for breakfast. One of my favorites in the whole city. Moroccan eggs are delicious. Would give 5/5 for food but the service can be terrible.  Went for breakfast on a Thursday morning with 2 others. No one came to take our order, we eventually asked a server if we could please order. He told us he could only take a drink order, we weren't able to order food yet...  Then when the meals came 2 arrived with scrambled eggs when poached were ordered. Wouldn't have been such a big deal- he brought additional correctly cooked eggs after we informed him. But when the bill came we had been charged for the additional eggs!  If they could tidy up the service it would be 5/5!	3star
Umm. Long story, short and brief.. I don't know what to say. Not my type of scene on weekend night but I felt like I was in a fight club arena with the gated sections of seatings. You can see people are seated through and through.. Against the gated sections leaning their back against it.. Umm. Let me poke a chopstick through your a***hole. Let's not be rude here but horrible seating layout. I am not going to deny the fact that I do like the actual bar setting. Pretty chic and neat concept. Pretty much sat there when we decided to come back a second time. It was way too packed earlier upon arrival. This would probably be a last resort if I was plastered enough. Otherwise, I wouldn't think of this place.	2star
Always go here when in area for work. Good and service is great. Staff is wonderful. Always a great time. Coworkers agree it's really good.	4star
"Because Jacob's Pickles is still closed, we went to its sister location for brunch.  Maison Pickle is an impressively large and visually very well-done restaurant which is for some reason extremely under air-conditioned.  When we were there, the thermostat which was tauntingly placed right above our table read 90 degrees for the whole meal.  Just no.  The servers are great and super nice, but it was hard to enjoy as our faces were melting off. The other annoying factor: The ""normal"" brunch fare (e.g., biscuit sandwiches, pancakes) are huge , filling, and delicious.  My tablemates ordered those and they were great!  I was hoping for something on the healthier (but still filling!) side, so I foolishly ordered the tomato cucumber sheep's milk salad.  Oh boy, this was a mistake.  The salad was SEVENTEEN dollars and consisted of, not exaggerating, about 1/2 of a cucumber and 5 cherry tomatoes, lightly dusted with cheese.  For that price I was expecting a salad's salad, the type of veggie dish you can really munch on, but it was just so lacking.  I might return, but will certainly not order a salad."	3star
Remember, this is midtown at a touristy restaurant. You will be paying a lot for mediocre food. Also, it feels like a cruise dining room and tastes like cruise food. If you like these things, then you'll be fine. Came for dinner for a friend's birthday, so I had no say in which restaurant we were going to. I wasn't expecting much based on the pictures, and good thing I set my expectations low. Our server had a dry, deadpan sense of humor which was actually tough to decipher if he was being an asshole or just joking. I think it was the latter. It was hard to get the attention of the servers at times, but there are a lot of bussers running around, and managers standing around. We had the following dishes: -Crab cake - full of shell pieces and bland ($23) -Lobster bisque - salty and more shrimpy than lobster flavor ($15) -Porterhouse - tough and chewy ($104) -Cod - overcooked, not memorable ($38) -Lobster mac and cheese - overcooked, mostly cheese ($16) -Brussels sprouts - nicely charred and tender, well-seasoned, probably the best food of the meal and I don't even like Brussels sprouts ($11) -Mushrooms - I think they forgot to season this because it was bland and undressed ($13) -Molten cake - the cake was rubbery, but the Molten was there so maybe it was undercooked (free with check-in) -Cheesecake - not dense enough to be called NY cheesecake ($12) -Creme brulee - it was ok but I think the texture was a bit off, too gooey ($12) Overall, it's not terrible, but I would prefer to never come back. They have nice matches though.	2star
"This is by far my worst food experience ever. The atmosphere is pretty nice, ""vintage"" but thats the only good thing about the place. The lemonade was nasty, tasted of seltzer water, and lemon juice. The water pitcher came and was dirty. Everything I ordered was unavailable. Frier wasn't working so no fried chicken, or french fries. Asked for a burger with bacon instead. The bacon was literally raw, and the burger was just too salty. My partner asked for sausage with toast and eggs. The toast was hard and bland, and the sausage seemed boiled or cooking in dumpling juice. The sausage was undercooked as well and nasty. The biscuits on the plate were SO DRYYYY! Do not waste your time or money. Nasty."	1star
I visited Root & Bone on April 20th around 8PM We did not make a reservation and my friend and I were seated at the window bar stools immediately.  The restaurant was not to full at this time and our waiter came to us right away. We ordered the  Basket of chicken, Mac & Cheese and the Cheese waffles The food was amazing everything came out in a timely manner and was cooked fresh.	5star
Truly a miss. We got the tasting with the wine pairing, and the entire meal was very disappointing. Simply put, the food was extremely underwhelming. Does not make sense why this restaurant has a Michelin star rating. Additionally, the chef's table kitchen crew was not professional. I saw workers lick spoons and scoop up food to put on customer's plates, and touch their hair before sticking their hands in the food. I understand display kitchens are very difficult, BUT if it can't be done right, it should not be done at all, especially for a restaurant with a Michelin star. Here is what we had: pomme soufflee, chicken oyster - fried chicken oyster, you can get this at Coney Island food stand and it's yummier blackfish - fine, any decent japanese restaurant would have this mackerel - again fine, but nothing special sea urchin - this was my favorite fish, very delicious ko egg - nothing special, just a poached egg with caviar, not memorable or unique at all beef - this was a huge disappointed, it felt like eating deli eat with BBQ sauce on top. This is the most disappointing beef I have ever had in a tasting menu. Truly embarrassing coming out of this establishment razor clam - this dish was unique, not good, just unique striped bass - it was interesting how they made the dish with the bass being cooked inside of the eggplant but the dish was bland and boring lamb - this was the main course and second most disappointing after the beef. the lamb was very hard and tough. probably one of the worst tasting lamb I have had. I cannot believe they made this the main course. I absolutely adore lamb and they ruined this dish completely for me foie gras lychee - this was the first dessert course and it was good wild rice - sesame icecream, it's good but something you can get in Chinatown easily strawberry rice pudding - fine, again, nothing special	1star
"At first sight place is difficult to be found with the name ""la esquina only being shown on one side of the venue. Inside the place possession a small intimate charm however the food leaves something to desire with steak and shrimp tacos somewhat dry in taste. The service outside is horrible. We came into the place purchase food and drinks left out however came back no more than hour if not  as myself knows the security by the door very well however he wasn't present at the time. I was told by the host/promoter/clipboard queen to go around the corner to a cafe just to enter to use the restroom. If you solely looking for simple basic drinks with a nice decor by all means this is the place for you. If you looking for a venue with substance and actually a ounce of customer service and respect this is not the place for you."	1star
I came here for GNO on a Tuesday night. I made a reservations online to avoid the wait. It was great that they sat us even though not everyone in our party was there. The place is cozy. We were able to have a conversation without screaming on top of our lungs when there's music playing. I had the anything goes drink and it was delicious. It's on the sour side which I don't mind. For appetizer, we got the shrimp flat bread, pull pork and avocado guac. Everything was delicious. The shrimp and pull pork were juicy. The avocado guac was fresh. For the entree, we got the skirt steak, sea bass and green pasta. The green pasta was a little too salty for me but everyone else enjoyed it. The steak was tender and juicy dispute the fact that we got it medium. For the sea bass, it was so smooth and well seasoned. Overall, I enjoyed the meal. Definitely would come back.	5star
People will usually tell you to get the grilled corn, but I worked by this place for two years gettin it for lunch and my go to item was the jicama salad.  If you like fruity salads it's perfect. The jicama gives it a nice crunchy texture and u get the sweetness from the mango and dried cranberries. The queso fresco is spongey and adds another nice texture without being too salty.  If you order take out they always forget they always forget the dressing but it's fine with or without it.	5star
Sugar freak has a number of options for just about every budget and pallet. The staff was helpful and non intrusive....best part is the menu. There were so many different choices. I honestly can't wait to go back. I ordered the happy hour drink for 5 bucks and an appetizer for 12 bucks. My husband got the soup and out bill was 27 dollars. Overall our food was tasty.  Tip: if you're ordering the calamari beware, the sauce is somewhat spicy for those that little tolerance or spice.	5star
My best friend and I dropped by for dinner. He got the beef rendang nasi lemak - the taste and texture of the beef rendang was good. It came with a boiled egg, sambal chilli and peanuts. I had the char kuay teow, which was one of the better versions I've ever had outside of Southeast Asia. It had the perfect ratio of chives, egg, chicken and noodles.   We also had the complimentary Thai iced tea, which was good and not too sweet.	4star
"OBAO NY Manhattan Hells Kitchen Restaurant Row 7:30pm Friday 3rd June 2016 Four Stars I have passed by this place dozens of times, and I always thought about stopping in. However, I had no idea it was an ""It"" place to be. The facade is two stories of windows with openable door to let a nice breeze in. The long black granite bar top takes up most of the front of the restaurant and seats about 15 people. There are a lot of filament lights that sets a beautiful atmosphere. The wood and black steel rounds out the ambiance.  We had a reservation for 9 and were seated almost immediately in the back. The cocktail list was pretty interesting. I wanted the smoke signal but it was unavailable because the smoke mahjong was broken. I had a $13 Makers Mark which came in a heavy rocks glass and Spherical-ish shaped ice.  If you follow them on Instagram obao_Ny, you get a free edamame.  We ordered a bunch of food and shared it. The papaya salad was refreshing, citrusy, with a hint of spice. The basil fried rice had thick succulent shrimp and a delicious mix of onions, scallions, egg, and bell peppers. The Pad See Ew had thick fresh rice noodles with brown sauce and Chinese broccoli. The short ribs were salty, fatty, and plentiful. The lobster Pad Thai ($35) had a whole crustacean. The claws and tail were expertly extracted and delicious. The glass noodles had a good flavor but overall only were too sweet and not enough salt and spice.  I really enjoyed the food. It was reasonably priced.  The service was okay. Overall, it was a good meal."	4star
Quick lunch/dinner place to do take-out. A variety of food options - hot buffet, pre-made kimbap, bento boxes, soups, banchans etc. Some tables inside, but a lot of people do take-out.  Food is pretty good, but nothing out of the ordinary. The key here is the convenience factor and the variety of food options. If you're a college/grad student who is on a budget, is craving home-made Korean food, and wants Korean food to take home to enjoy while watching your favorite K-drama, Woorijip is your best friend.   Prices are friendly. Most bento boxes run $6-8, banchans are $5 or so. My fav is the sweet and sour chicken and kimchi pork.	3star
The best thing about waiting for a table at Taverna Kyclades is that they give you wine while you're waiting. This is where my boyfriend and I had our first date. Having to wait for a table on a Tuesday night actually turned out to be a good thing because we got to know each other more before sitting down lol. They didn't have grilled calamari this night, so we ended up getting 3 orders of octopus! The octopus is good!! I would recommend the branzino and grilled seafood dishes over the fried calamari (which surprisingly isn't as good as the grilled calamari). I also enjoy the lemon potatoes.. mmm! Give this place a try. You'll feel like you're at someone's home in Greece. And then walk over a few blocks to Martha's bakery for dessert, like we did, for a great date night :)	4star
Came here for a brunch day with my GF the decor was nice. We ordered the chicken and waffles and a Benedict. I must say the chicken and waffles was pretty delicious on par with Buttermilk Chanel and the Benedict was mediocre. Overall it is a typical American brunch place that is neither amazing nor dissappointing.	3star
This place is pretty small. I came here to grab poke since I saw the good reviews. Their poke bowls are prefix. So, you don't really get to experience making your own which is a bummer for me. I got 1 and 2 on the menu. Number one gave a spicy kick due to the spicy mayo and number two was on the refreshing side. The salmon was fresh. I enjoyed poke but it's nothing special that I'll go out of my way to get. They also offer semi cooked salmon and tuna.	3star
I'm typically not a fan of 'Chinese' cuisine, but everything we got at this place, I found to be delicious: pork soup dumplings crab soup dumplings black fungi ...can't remember what else... Will definitely be back, and this time introduce some other friends to the place.	5star
This place is good. Just good. The ambiance is a little scary. Like a run down Asian mafia. Lots of old Asian men eating and speaking in various languages. Staff wasn't exactly friendly. Food was good. Nothing to write home about.	3star
Cool to have a 24/7 diner near Chelsea - food is not stellar quality or anything (I'd be surprised if I ever came across a diner that had amazing food), but for what it's worth, the food that I've ordered was pretty good! I've been here on two separate occasions, and was happy with the food both times. The first time, I came during dinner time, so I got the Lomo Saltado (21.95) which is basically beef short ribs with onions, tomatoes, and rice. I love short ribs so I thought this was really good! On my second visit, I just got Huevos Rancheros for brunch - yummy, but not outstanding. For apps, I tried their empanadas, which were good but not all that. I also asked for cheese croquettes once but our waiter forgot about it - didn't mind it too much since I was already full from brunch.	3star
This wins as the #1 West Village/Greenwich Village happy hour spot. Not only is it cozy but it's lively and has a great spirit about it.  The wine flights are a dream! Highly recommend this for a quick 3-4 group catch up. :)	5star
The reviews don't lie -- these tacos were amazing, fast and so tasty. The corn tortillas were some of the best tortillas I've had outside of Mexico. Very happy I was able to try this spot while in NYC.	5star
Okay so at 4 stars and 1800+ reviews, clearly everyone else has already said everything that there is to say about Calle Ocho. Came here for Sunday brunch (1/17/2016) with 7 friends and we had a very, very nice time. Everything was great and enjoyable - food, drinks, service, ambiance, everythanggggg.  Reservations are definitely a must (like weeks in advance!) We were seated at a round table for 8 which I like SO much better for a big group as opposed to a long table where you can't necessarily see or talk to everyone. The atmosphere was so lively, fun, festive, and the restaurant was definitely filled to capacity. It was the perfect vibe for boozy brunch. The unlimited sangria that comes with ordering off the brunch menu was AMAZING. 8 different kinds to choose from and they're actually really very good, strong, and served in decent size glasses. Our server was great and kept them coming (even after we got the bill, he brought not one but two more rounds for the table!) What a guy... The food was delicious. A lot of places that do boozy brunch tend to skimp on food quality because people are more concerned with getting drunk but Calle Ocho perfected both their sangria menu as well as the brunch entrees. I went with the Vaca Frita (skirt steak with two eggs, rice, and avocado). The steak was cooked well and so so SO tender and flavorful. Everyone else at the table enjoyed their food and we were sharing and passing things around because it was all SO GOOD. The fresh baked bread served beforehand was so warm and delicious. The strawberry butter that accompanied the bread basket was pleasantly different and really good as well. Prices are reasonable at $20-something an entree + bottomless sangria. Again with the service/rest of the staff being fantastic, were were about 20 minutes late but they still held our reservation because one person from the group was there on time and said we were on the way. ALSO, the bathroom was ridiculously clean for such a large and busy restaurant which means the kitchen's clean as well! Basically, I can't wait to return.	5star
I'd come back for the risotto alone.  It's so hard to find a perfectly cooked and seasoned risotto these days.  The meat and cheese platter was really delicious and a great start to our meal.  The vongole pasta was al dente and seasoned very well (had a bit of a kick, which I really liked).  I'm curious about the other items on the menu as everything I tried was truly delicious.  I wasn't too impressed with dessert but I was too full from dinner anyway!  Final thoughts: great decor, dim lighting, and quiet atmosphere make for a great date spot or low key dinner with a good friend.	4star
Had a very good Thai lunch here. Prices are very reasonable and food is delicious. As a true yelper, I took into account all the raving about the curry puff. They were indeed very good. It's a chicken and peas within a puff pastry ball, similar to a samosa. I highly recommend it as an appetizer. For entrees, I ordered the eggplant basil with chicken and my boyfriend ordered the pad Thai. Eggplant basil is sautéed eggplants, onions, bell peppers and basil in a spicy sauce with a protein of your choice. My boyfriend ordered the pad Thai which was your simply delicious pad Thai.  It's a great spot for basic Thai food offering simply delicious meals at reasonable prices.	4star
Was roaming around the area visiting my cousins workplace and came across this pizza bar. Didn't expect much since we were all just very hungry but surprisingly turned out to be one of the best pizza places! We tried two pizzas and loved both of them! The food also came out pretty quickly which is always a plus	4star
I love the new location!  Food and service were great but they didn't have so many things from the menu at 6 pm.	3star
Sugar freak has one of a kind cocktails, and even better food. I really enjoy the gumbo, but no matter what I order it always comes out tasting great and in a timely fashion. All of the bartenders are friendly, especially their hot manager Nick; none of them leave any customer hanging or waiting for a long time before they get helped. If I could give 6 stars I would.	5star
Highly: pork and crab XL, Shanghai Lo Mein with shrimp and mixed meat and the scallion pancake. All so good. Service is pretty fast and friendly; they don't rush you out especially since there's always a wait. I've been there twice and I've waited 30-40 mins both times.	5star
Came here on a Friday night with family, had no trouble getting a reservation the day of. The ambiance is warm and cozy with a fireplace and huge lamps. I will say, it is waaayy too dimly lit. I honestly could barely see the people I was eating with. The table we were at was too small, despite the fact that the restaurant space is quite large, there was barely room for our glasses and food.  The food was okay. My pizza with speck easily fed two people and was nice and crusty. The lasagna bolognese was SUPER cheesy and heavy, the portion was also a bit small. Service was friendly and prompt. Overall it was pretty nice, not sure if I'd return but I'm happy I went.	3star
Came for a weekday lunch. The place was relatively  busy, but not sure how it would be on the weekends. We made reservations in advance, which is helpful, but does not seem to be necessary for lunch time. The food here is really great - at least the pasta dishes for sure. The salads don't stand out and I can't speak specifically to the paninis or the entrees, but everyone who got a pasta dish was a huge fan. I specifically tried the Rigate, which comes with penne, tomato sauce, and burrata. The tomato sauce here is delicious. It's creamy and decadent, not runny at all. Ambiance is nice - wooden and rustic, but upscale. I would definitely come back.	4star
This place gets one star because the food is decent and it's the only bar on this island. If you don't mind a simple meal turning into a 3 hour ordeal, come here. The employees are nice, I guess, I wouldn't know because they never attend to you. Every time I'm here it takes forever to get service and even longer to get your check and leave. Like now, for example, I'm stilling waiting for the waitress to come by with the check. Haven't seen her since she took our order. Making the move to come here is always hard. I want waffle fries, but I don't want to be there for 3 hours.  Not good service	1star
The delivery service was fast which is great but the pizza really wasn't that great. Thin crust which is similar to what is traditionally served in Italy was okay, but the sauce was not that great and the margarita had pretty much only cheese, VERY light on the basil and tomato. I won't go out of my way to eat here again. I also ordered the truffle bruschetta which was really bad. It tasted sour and it was literally 1 slice of bread for $7.	2star
Just finished brunch.  We sat in the back room- lots of light and very lovely! We arrived at 12:30 and was surprised to find the place almost empty.   The food:   Duck confit - amazing!  Order this. Cv burger - this was ok.  Also very nice pot of tea.	3star
Expect to be quick when ordering...which is good because that means the quicker you get to taste the delicious soup dumplings. We ordered the pork dumplings and yes they where the best I have ever had. We also ordered the Kung pao, sesame chicken, spicy prawns and green beans. I enjoyed the sesame chicken the best, so much flavor and tasted great.	5star
Unfortunately this was the worst restaurant that I have ever been to in N.Y.C in my life! The service was terrible the entire night. Our waitress was just outright rude! The food was horrible, my pasta tasted like the chef poured the entire salt shaker on top. It took 4 minutes to receive our drinks, then when we ordered a second round of drinks it took another 1/2 an hour for someone to deliver them to our table. The manager apologized but when our bill came, we were all shocked that he did not even take one round of drinks off the tab. I would definilty not recommend this restaurant to anyone. The staff is young, incompetent and not accommodating at all. The worst in New York City!! Don't waste your time, there are too many other fantastic restaurants in N.Y.C to patronize. Do not dine at MAIALINO.	1star
"Really, 2.5 but that's not an option.  Definitely not 3. Immediately upon walking in the door they clarify that it's a DIY kinda place.  ""You can get your water here.""  Oh gee, thanks for that great service.  There is a cup with some sticks, paper, and utensils on the table. I got a special.  It cost f#$@ing $25.  My wife ordered something standard from the menu.  Both were unremarkable.  For a Vietnamese curry, it tasted a lot like the chicken roti/curries I just ate in the Caribbean.  The summer roll was large, sauce was good, but again unremarkable (roll was rice, lettuce, shrimp, and carrot or something).   Now, I'm all for low key joints.  But if it has a low key vibe, and a serve yourself attitude, AND still going to charge a $14-25 price tag for an entree-- that *ish better be good yo."	2star
Dude, if you like ramen, don't come here. You will regret. Fasten noodle is even better than their ramen. But they offer nice Japanese beer.	2star
Not vegetarian friendly.  Chinese restaurant typically have a dozen vegetarian options in all categories... Not the case here.	1star
Finally, finally, finally, went to Jacob's Pickles. I had tried to get in once for lunch and the wait was too long, so I ended up here for a dinner at midnight on weekend. You know the type of food that makes your heart happy? Well Jacob's Pickles brings me happiness.  Spicy okra and the fried chicken and mushroom gravy with cheesy grits...I'm getting so hungry just thinking about it. Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu. Service was good and the ambience was perfect for a chill, late night in the city. Do yourself a favor and check this place out.	5star
Food is fantastic. 5 stars for that. Service is far from fantastic. Here is why..... I called to make a reservation for a Saturday night birthday party on Friday afternoon. Set the reservation for 5:30pm and gave my name and information. Said I would call back if our numbers changed.  Got a call a few hours later to confirm. When I called back, I was told that there was no record of my reservation. This was the first red flag..... Regardless, they were able to set the reservation again and lock us in.  We arrive on Saturday and settle at the bar as the full party arrives. My wife and her friend order the Strawberry Balsamic. Loved them. Great service at the bar from Tyler. He was the highlight of the night. Party arrives, we close out and get to our table.  And this is where everything goes downhill.... Place a large order with several items. Waitress tells us they will stagger the plates accordingly.  Food starts to come. And my wife and her friend order another round of the Strawberry Balsamic.  The drinks they receive look and taste NOTHING like the first round we purchased at the bar. They make the waitress aware. She says they well get them a fresh round.  About 10 minutes later, they still don't have their fresh drinks. Another seemingly managerial woman comes over, asks what they didn't like about the drinks. They tell her, and specifically tell her that Tyler made them.  10 minutes later they bring ONE drink. Mind you, two were ordered. So now my wife's friend is STILL waiting for her drink. And the drink they bring still looks and tastes nothing like the first round we purchased.  So I just get up and go to the bar and buy a round of drinks from Tyler. For the remainder of the night, I just go to the bar and get drinks myself since we weren't getting what we needed at our table. I just wanted my wife to have a nice time and wasn't in the mood to get into it with the staff.  In addition to this drink fiasco, another member of our party ordered a glass of wine that never came, and they charged us for some tequila drink that no one ordered.  Now onto the food. We start receiving our food. Get a few plates. Then about 20 minutes to 1/2 hour go by with no food, then a flood of food. So that pacing we were promised when we ordered did not happen.  And much like the wine, several of the small plates we ordered were never served. What made matters even worse was that every time we made the waitress aware of this, she seemed completely indifferent to it.  Since it's a birthday, we order dessert. 3 of us order the same dessert, one orders something different. The 3 identical desserts come, 20 minutes later, the different one has not. We have to remind the waitress AGAIN that something we ordered had not arrived. And then 10 minutes after that, they bring the last dessert.  Issue after issue after issue with every order we placed.  Shout out to Tyler for being a great bartender. Again, food is great so it's good if you just want a casual night out and can get through the service issues.  But if you're out for more of a special occasion, or a business dinner with a client, you'd likely be better served finding a restaurant that places more of a premium on service.	3star
Great flavor but small portions, especially for the price/location. Wait staff was a little weird... They told us when we sat down that we might have to move to another table, but that there was a 90% chance we wouldn't have to. Whaaaa? We asked if we could sit at a different table that was open, and they just told us to stay where we were. Kind of weird, yeah? Definitely wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again...	2star
So I texted my friends and asked what they recommend in NYC. Both (they don't know each other) texted me saying try Ippudo. I am very very picky with my Ramen... so I was a little skeptical.  Anyways while watching Miss Saigon, on stage someone was eating noodles. It made me crave for ramen. So at intermission I googled Ippudo and guess what? It was less than a mile from Miss Saigon.  So hubby and I headed over there. Still skeptical but we finally got seated. We ordered buns (pork and beef) and we thought they were delicious. Then comes the Ramen. Let's just say I was a little nervous (silly but true). I took one taste of the broth and I was in heaven. It was what I hoped it would taste. I ordered the spicy ramen (sorry I forgot the name). This place will not disappoint you!	5star
"I will definitely not go to the place again. Today we had three people there for lunch. My food was ok but my friend's was not. The worst part is the waiter's attitude. One of my friend got a Pad Kee Mao which had half toppings cold. When the waiter served our table, he told the waiter with good manner. We all thought it was not that serious and just wanna the kitchen aware of it. Surprisingly, the waiter replied so improper; he said they always cook Pad Kee Mao ""like this"" more than once. Personally I would not say he was gentle but a bit aggressive instead. All of us felt uncomfortable. Before we left, the guy said the same thing again. It was too hard to communicate with and this time is really the worst service I had so far during the five years in NYC."	1star
"So for years I've loved Supper, a family, crazy-menu, home-style Italian joint in the East Village. It used to be the kind of place where the waiters gave you a drink or a dessert at the end of the night just because. (And by ""used to,"" I mean 2 years ago.) No longer. The last two times I've gone to Supper, it's turned into a Chuck E. Cheese for adults with birthdays. I just left there this evening. And tonight, in the back room, where there are all of 7ish tables, the lights were turned off 5 times--5!--as all the wait staff sang ""Happy birthday mamacita"" 5 times. To 5 different tables. 5!! Over 90 minutes. Meantime, it was seriously difficult to keep a conversation going. And no one really cared about our sad birthdayless table. No one checked on us, and to get drinks took Herculean effort. Needless to say, there was nothing free at evening's end, not even leftover birthday cake. To get our check, again, took me acting like a freaking mime, waving my arms like a crazy woman. If only I had a flare, or a birthday candle.  Anyway--my advice: go here! But if you do, do not sit in the birthday area in the back room. Sit in front, or in the bar next door. Unless it's your birthday. Then, sit in back. At least you'll get some free cake."	2star
Came here on a Saturday afternoon with a reservation for a party of 5. Originally we had the reservation for 4, but last minute on the day of we had that changed, and they did so without any difficulty.  We arrived 20 minutes early, and was immediately seated. The restaurant had live music as well. There's a sunroof room within in the restaurant that's actually really nice but because it was too hot and sunny, we decided to be seated indoors at the booth, which was great as well.  We ordered the bottomless brunch without drinks ($30) and with the 5 of us, had 24 dishes. Their plates are pretty small, so basically like tapas, but it was pretty filling though. There's a 2 hour limit for the brunch. However, it was difficult getting a waiter to come around for our next order, and after a while our dishes began to come out at a slower pace. The service began to decline as we neared the 2 hour mark.  The food was good, but our favorite definitely was the tuna tar guac! Must order! Overall, it a good brunch place and worth going to.	4star
Came here for happy hour with a party of 10 for a friend's birthday. I already made reservations so the seating process was quick and easy. My girlfriend and I got the $70 Premium set and our whole table got around ~8 Sapporo pitchers ($14 during HH).  I've been here many times and the meat is always so fresh, flavorful, and delicious. The beer draft is also very refreshing and compliments the meats very well. Definitely recommend coming here during Happy Hour for the food or just drinks! After we left the restaurant, we realized that the waiter charged my order incorrectly for the Premium set; they charged each item separately (the rest of the table's check was correct). I called the restaurant the next morning and explained to the manager what was incorrect and he offered me back the difference and cash and an extra gift card on top for the inconvenience.	4star
I can't stress enough how amazing this place is!!! Service was excellent,food was full of flavor,place is simply amazing.We are definitely coming back for more.	5star
Very quaint & cozy place to stop by and warm up with a some tapas. The place has exposed brick and it's beautifully decorated; and with its dim lighting, it's perfect for date night or to catch up with some friends. John one of the owners, was around this evening (Nov 24) and he is polite with guests. We had some interesting and delicious beer! .. Of which I have never heard of before like Pumpkin Ale (soooo good)! I have posted photos of all of our dishes that we shared (among two). We ordered the Piave/Italy cheese with a side of olives (delicious!!!) the Toasted Danielle (something was a tad salty there but it was still good; we ate it all), the House Special (it's a yummy yummy soup!!) and the crazy beer was great. I would definitely go back and recommend to anyone who likes to hang in a really cool spot.	5star
Bogota is a cool spot and has a few good items on the menu, but has quickly fallen victim to the chain restaurant mentality since finding success and thus has taken its following for granted by compromising quality in favor of quantity. This place would do great in Times Square since it has that touristy 42nd St. vibe. But if you're looking for an upbeat casual atmosphere, some decent eats, and a few drinks near Downtown BK then Bogota may fit the bill ... but beware its a little on the pricey side. Personally, I stick with the catfish tacos (which are slammin) and a couple of drinks, but that will even run you $40-50 easy!  Overall its a cool spot, especially if you have a group in tow ...	3star
Was it a mess because there was a wedding upstairs? It was almost empty save the wedding. And I don't think so because a guy who looked like an owner/manager never tried to correct anything. It took forever to get drinks -- then two of four, then another 5 min later, then the last, which was not what was ordered! There were a couple other drinks brought out too that were not ours. It took a while for them to decide if the maker fish was available. Then when I ordered two appetizers, and was asked when and in what order I wanted them, I got nothing when everyone else got theirs, then both with the mains. The food may have been good, at that point I no longer cared. One of my appetizers was cold (and was supposed to be hot) by the time I got it.	2star
The service was excellent and the food tasted good for the most part. The reason for this 2 star review is directed at the fake fillet mignon I was served. You would expect a fat round juicy piece of delicious meat. What I got was a flat, thin, over cooked, dry, rough, piece of London broil. After reading all the raving reviews, i was really disappointed and most likely won't be returning for any meals in the near future. I must say, aside from that steak, everything else was great.	2star
Been here twice; first time for dinner & second time for brunch and of cause The Alcove did not disappoint.  For dinner, we ordered the skirt steak lollipops, smoked salmon crostinis, burger with quail egg and three tacos: chorizo, steak and chicken. I recommend all four items because it was actually delicious. We arrived for late brunch at 2:15pm and there was no wait. We ordered the burger with avocado, which comes with a slice of pineapple and the smashed avocado toast with poached eggs. The yolk was still leaky when we cut into it, what a perfect poached egg! We also ordered their flight to try all the amazing local light beers and my favorite was the Wiether pale ale and the beer that was a collaboration with Transmitter & another local brewery.  The owners, Jonathan & Maria provided us the best service anyone can ask for!  We will definitely be back again for dinner to get the skirt steak lollipops again! What a great addition to the Sunnyside neighborhood.	5star
This is what I have been missing!! Came her as a last resort due to the amazing Yelp reviews and i couldn't have be happier.  Came here to meet an old friend and to show her the best parts of Williamsburg since she just moved here. I believe she started coming her religious after that and I can't lie so have I.  The food is amazing, the chief has an amazing taste. Any dish you try the flavors are well paired with everything on the plate it leaves you wanting more and more. I have made it a mission to try the entire menu.  If I was to make a list of my favorite the entire menu would be here so I feel that may be pointless.... But go try for yourself I assure you that you wont be disappointment with anything you pick.  ENJOY!! I know I have.	5star
Came here to try the Columbian platter special. We were there on a Friday night and it was packed. Waited an hour on line. Then got settled and they started us off with chips. The columbian platter was very dry for my tasting. The pork belly was overcooked and hard. Disappointed.	2star
"3.5 STARS I have wanted to try this place for quite some time, and it has either been too late or packed with a wait time that makes me question why I live in the city,  while cursing the invaders of what was once a ""sketchy neighborhood"" according to one of my fellow Yelpers;  who is way too young to remember when her now hipster east village home was once called ""the shooting gallery"" and not because of gunshots(and I wonder why I will never become a Yelp elite)....but I digress' The salad mix was well dressed and nicely seasoned, the famous homemade dumplings were very good and yeah I am a fan. Also the side of ""homemade kimchee"" was new, sweet and not at all sour(which I love BTW). It did not seem to have much garlic or pear or onion and seemed to have a basic paste, decent.  The mains that we had were the tofu and rice ""korean style"" was very good with a perfectly fried, lightly battered tofu that was some of the best I have had in quite some time. I did wish the egg was cooked a little less but I would come back here for this dish if I did not have to wait. The other main was the pan seared cod was also very nice and cooked to a perfect flakiness with a nice broth, a little under seasoned or maybe mild would be more appropriate. The drinks were a glass of sparkling white on the list and a pilsner that was served warm or in a warm pint glass or both. I asked for the waiter(who was very nice and attentive considering how busy it was) to get me a club soda and he knew that I was not happy so when we received the bill the drinks were removed which was a nice surprise. The place is always packed so that says something and if you are patient you will have a nice meal in small local establishment."	3star
Incredible.. perfect from the smell of the flowers when you walk in, to the attentive service to the delectible food. Thank you.	5star
I've wanted to check out Uglyduckling ever since it opened, and finally had a chance to. It's hard to stand out on Smith Street due to all the other restaurants, but Uglyduckling has done a good job. The space is part of the old MTA building that's now next to Lululemon, so it has super high ceilings, and painted brick walls. Looks great. They also have 30 beers on tap (nothing too crazy, but some good local crafts). Their menu is also pretty extensive. Whether you want to eat by land or by sea, they have several options. Don't be fooled by the name though; they actually have several vegetarian options that sounded great. But of course, that's not why we came here. The Ugly poutine (provolone, duck confit and sweet BBQ) was solid. Not your typical poutine, to say the least. The BBQ sauce goes well with the duck, but don't expect something reminiscent of Canada. The fries were bit soggy, likely due to the deep bowl they were served in, but still good. My friend and I both got Uglyduckling burgers. Sadly, they've changed their menu a bit (either permanently or for the week I was there). Their website still lists their namesake burger has having a fried quail egg and pork belly. The one that was available when I went (first week of September) instead included fried cheese (I forgot what kind) and grilled onions on top. Not quite as adventurous, but it was still a damn fine burger. The breading on the fried cheese (I forget what kind it was) added some nice texture (kind of like when you get the Shake Shack burger with a fried mushroom on top). I got mine medium rare, and it was cooked perfectly. They offer three condiments (ketchup, mustard and mayo) and the burger tasted great with any of the three. Since we ordered the poutine, we didn't want to overdo it with the fries, and they allowed us to make a substitution for any of the other sides, without additional charge. My buddy did the grilled veggies (squash, cucumbers, and possibly other gourds). I did the sweet potato hash, served with kale. Delicious, but totally defeated the purpose of not getting fries. Definitely worth it. Only complaint was that the sides were a bit oily, so it made the veggies seem a lot less healthy. Service was great. Our waitress made some great beer recommendations (and gave us samples in fancy glasses). Also, I left a bag on the ledge behind our table, and when I came back looking for it two hours later, our waitress popped out of nowhere and handed it to me. Can't beat that! All in all, Uglyduckling is a welcome addition to the neighborhood, and I'll definitely be back. Hope to try the duck confit sandwich for lunch.	4star
Normally I would give this place 3 stars, but the Tres Leches was one of the best things I've ever eaten!   Guacamole:  Very fresh, perfect amount of spice, warm homemade chips Fried Oysters:  Didn't really taste like anything and they were soggy Salsa Verde Enchiladas: these were fine, definitely not worth the price Mole Enchiladas: these were tasty but, we were not blown away Tres Leches: YOU MUST ORDER THE TRES LECHES!  This made up for the rest of our meal being subpar.  I wish I had ordered my own and did not have to share it with my boyfriend!	4star
I came here last night with a group of friends to check out this new restaurant that opened a little over a week ago.  A nice 5-7 minute walk from the Greenpoint Avenue G train stop.  I really liked the wide spacious interior setting, with some bench seatings, and regular table seatings surrounding the bar area.  They have their liquor license, offering beer, wine, and cocktails!  We decided to do family style, and ordered almost everything off their menu.   Everything tasted amazing!  My personal favorites, funny enough, were the dishes that I don't eat at all:  the lamb tartare, and the whole rabbit.  I don't eat lamb because I hate the gamey taste of it.  Now, I'm not saying their lamb tartare converted me to starting eating lamb, but WOW.  There was absolutely no gamey taste at all!  All the seasonings that went into the lamb tartare were sensational!  I was actually scraping at the bowl to try to get the last bits and pieces of it.  I've never had rabbit before, but this rabbit was so good.  It was very tender and moist.  Other personal favorites included their flaky bread (smooth warm buttery goodness). My only (and minor) critique was their hummus.  It was a little bland, and wished it had a tad bit more seasonings in it.   I'll definitely be back!	4star
Will not return. Had huevos rancheros. Bland, uninspired and not filling. Hubby had chicken and waffles. Butter and waffle were tasty but he joked that it was a child's portion.	2star
"It's been a while since I've had some tacos, and seeing this place really struck up a taco craving.  The hubby told me this is a popping place in Chelsea; I can see why.  It was actually a perfect find since we needed a place to grab some food before a show and this is right in the Times Square area so it was very convenient.  Not sure what the usual crowd is here, but there was no wait for us on a Saturday evening at 6:00pm. I like that the menu is low-key and simple, the service is fast but pleasant, and they just assemble the tacos so efficiently.  It was a nice touch to have them in those paper wrappers/holders instead of spilling out all over the plate.   We went for the chicken, beef and pork tacos on corn tortillas ""con todo"" toppings. It was pretty delicious and they were all surprisingly juicy.  I think the pork was our favorite, since it had the most flavor.  We were unexpectedly full after eating our tacos (2 for me, 3 for the hubby and a soda). I'm not sure how they stack up to other places in terms of prices, but I wouldn't say they were expensive/overpriced.  They seemed to be pretty worth it for what you pay. Note: there aren't any places to sit, it's all standing counters/tables. They do seem provide some things so you can pack your food to go if you don't ask for it at the counter."	4star
I would give 3.5. Spicy cumin lamb hand-ripped noodles in soup. Very spicy yet flavorful. Average quality and quantity of lamb. Three pieces of boiled cabbage and some chopped celery. Chewy hand-ripped noodles. The soup is a little oily.	3star
"So does this place just keep getting better?  I'm on a total health kick so I try not to go to Roberta unless I'm having one of those cheat days dedicated to the Pizza Gods. Last night I got to have my metaphorical cake and eat it too. We ordered a delicious pizza and the Kitchen dishes. It looked like they were stealing off the menu from Blancas at a tenth of the price because I was blown away!!! If blanca's is the panty dropper then this menu is the foreplay. Everything was super light and healthy.  Fav eats: The squid was to die for and the squash with hazelnuts was foodgasm galore.   The service is bushwick-esque rated ""eh,"" but if the happiness formula is to close the gap between reality and expectations, I can overcome my need for service for everything else being on point... for now."	5star
We must have picked the worse items on the menu - the grilled chicken was dry the fries cold the fish overly fried...not planning on coming back. The only upside is that the outdoor space is nice.	2star
"Risking public backlash, I'm going on record and saying grimaldis is all hype. I've gone quite a few times and I'm just about always unsatisfied. First impressions with the line will probably boost your anticipation, however the service is less than admirable and the pizza the same. Yea it's crispy but not consistent. It's a dry pie, thin crust as they want it, but not fresh tasting at all. While I say these harsh things I feel there are some redeeming qualities but I simply cannot think of any; you'll find multiple locations, all serving their pies in a bag, all with the grimaldis name, and all with the same boring flavor profiles. To me, it's an overwhelming ""eh."" Too much hype, not enough love. I came fro Di Faras as well which is by far a better pizza so the comparison is a bit unbalanced. As well, I went to Ignazio's around the corner from grimaldis after (took the gf on a pizza tour that day, good sport) and despite their multitude of biased reviews due to grimaldis loyalists, they had a good pie as well and a lot less of a line; a bit friendlier and tastier hands down. Places like this always get business, and the hype always continues because of that mob mentality or something, it's sort of rubbish if you ask me."	2star
Eh. Very nice ambiance. Food was alright. Nothing horribly, but poorly executed and odd interpretations of the food. If this restaurant was a café I could see it doing well as a place to eat small plates and drink coffee while working. It was all but empty on a saturday night except for a few couples. I now see why. I wasn't dissatisfied, but 50 bucks for a dinner for two and neither of us walked away especially happy.  Wait staff was also a bit off. One waitress chastised a customer for leaning back in their seat because a potted plant was behind them. Then don't place a potted plant there, hello? Don't they know hospitality is about caring for customers, not the other way around?  More in depth review: Beautiful ambiance. Very cozy, wood tables, cushioned booths with big fluffy pillows, and the flicker of candles to well chosen music. Wait staff was stand offish and also did not make customers feel at ease. Weren't very happy, just seemed to be slogging through their job. Considering that the chef was in the house this evening, and the food wasn't that good, we won't be coming back. He obviously knows a thing or two about flavor profiles and presentation, but the execution was very off. I ordered a spaghetti carbonara. The pasta was undercooked, and the sauce was way too runny, resembling a paprikash.  Neither the pasta nor plate was hot enough for the egg yolk the cook as I mixed it in. If you're going to try to do it right, do it right.  For the table, we got a green salad. This required very little execution and was excellent. The tarragon dressing was a nice touch. My girlfriend got risotto. This was obviously not lovingly stirred for hours, or even lovingly stirred five hours ago and then help for service. The rice was dense and its broth was almost runny. For some reason, the chef had chosen to incorporate barely seasoned, diced carrots into it which added nothing to the dish but textural oddities.  Perhaps as penance, we, along with other tables, were served free desserts. It was a cold sponge cake soaked in cream and drizzled with dulce de leche. It was decent, but it was way too cold as if it didn't receive any time to temper from the walk in. It also had a weird texture and struck me as left overs from a catering event or something like that. Over all, it was entirely meh-worthy for a not meh-worthy price. If we paid $15 each, I'd be happy.	2star
uh, BEFORE you make a reservation, please double check you really know exactly where it is located & how you will get there! And it isn't marked either. Just an odd dinner for 3. Not really sure what Shanghainese cuisine is? How different from Cantonese? Jellyfish app had nothing to it 2 of us thought. Soup dumplings good, but certainly not extraordinary. 1 of 3 loved their entrée (8 delicacies in spicy sauce), other two entrées ok. Weird not having large bottles of sparking water or being thrifty with the soy sauce. Décor was lovely & service not bad just a bit odd.	3star
Aside from having an awesome name (#1), Buttermilk Channel has been a mainstay in the Brooklyn brunch scene for quite some time. But BC is more than just brunch, it is one of the most underrated establishments in the borough with its eclectic menu and its impressive take on refined American cuisine. Brunch is one of the many reasons folks will come, which is a fabulous time to visit even if the wait is long on the weekends. I love the Short RIb Hash ($16) and the Buttermilk Pancakes ($11) are fluffy yet delicious. While the Eggs Huntington ($13) is really a fancier, perhaps tastier version of eggs benedict, the Fried Pork Chop + Cheddar Waffles ($17) is an upgraded version of chicken and waffles. Hash Browns ($5) are also served here but sadly in patty form. Doh. The dinner menu consists of a seasonal variety of dishes grouped by first and second courses. I won't lie, I've been less than thrilled with most of the first course options, but the food in the latter group has been fantastic. The Duck Meatloaf ($28) is exactly as it sounds, but accompanied by a very tasty dirty rice, pickled okra, and pickled peppers. Folks are ga-ga over the Buttermilk Fried Chicken ($27) which is full of flavor and crunch, but the Pan Roasted Hanger Steak ($28) has my attention for its juicy preparation and unforgettable bite. Even the Burger ($18) is one of their better choices, which also comes from super crunchy fries as well. Versatility is one way to describe the cozy interior. It's perfectly bright, homey during the daytime and wonderfully dimmed for an intimate ambiance at night. The service is fairly prompt and professional and the prices are expected for the area. Ultimately, BC is a nice establishment for all occasions, be it a date, celebratory dinner, or the occasional bite while hanging around Downtown Brooklyn. ____________ (#1) Which is the same name for the mile long path between Brooklyn and Governor's Island.	4star
I've been here a million times and it never disappoints! I went with some friends for the lunch special today and we got a lot of food for only $11 per entree (that comes with two small apps - see pics below!). The restaurant has a great atmosphere and has private and communal tables. The wait staff is pretty friendly and they are very attentive as they refill waters often and ask if anything else is needed. We just walked in and were seated immediately (usually not a problem during lunch) but I recommend thurs fri sat night to make a reservation as this place is usually a bit busy.	5star
Very excited to have good fried chicken, and it was good. Not as good as The Ribbon, and I'm a child of an Alabama born woman! Unfortunately, The Ribbon has no waffle. and it would be fantastic if they did.	2star
I usually have good experiences at both locations but last night, I went with one other girlfriend to this spot. Both the food and service were mediocre. I'll start with the service - granted it was a little after 10pm, there were still quite a bit of people there. The waitress and waiters kept coming up to us multiple times to see if we're done or ready for the check. It actually became overwhelming since they kept interrupting us in the middle of our conversations. We were there to catch up over some good food and these guys wouldn't leave us alone! I think they should really coordinate a main waiter/waitress for each table. That just looked badly organized and rude. Or undergo more training to sense when customers want to be bothered and when they don't. We ordered the sashimi salad, tiger roll, and seafood glass noodles to share. The noodles were definitely good, well spiced and contained a good amount of seafood. However, the sashimi salad was extremely underwhelming. I found several pinky-sized tiny pieces of sashimi and the rest of the large bowl was all leafy greens. It was definitely not worth the money and definitely makes you feel ripped off. You might as well go home and whip up something more impressive. The tiger roll (with notably bigger pieces of the sashimi) was not bad but the rice was too mushy and a more well-thought out roll would not contain that much rice nor have that much sushi vinegar into its rice. All in all, I would try to look at other places before I would try to come back here.	3star
"Came here with a baby stroller and one other person and asked to be seated outside. Hostess deliberately put another customer that came five minutes after us in front of us at our table because ""they were insistent"" and she got ""confused"". We mentioned that we were with a stroller. The waitress told us to make ""the baby cry"" to get them to free a table. Excuse me? You deliberately seat someone else before us because you can't check your list, and tell us to make the baby cry to get another table? I'm in shock that they told us to make a baby cry in order to get a table that we should have gotten first. In addition, they offered us a table where the stroller would not fit. Extremely disappointed and disgusted at their treatment of customers, as well as making us wait for their mistake. You go in order. Not what Customer is ""demanding"" to skip the line. No apology whatsoever. Having worked in the restaurant industry for ten years, never have I witnessed this behavior. Shocked and appalled. Management needs to train these people what customer service really is."	1star
I really want to love this place. It's in a great location and the new spot is really well done. It looks fantastic and has a nice bar. They were busy but the service was still very good and our waiter was personable. Unfortunately my 3 stars comes down to the food itself. I was super excited to try their lobster roll (especially given the name of the restaurant)...but it ended up being disappointing, especially compared to other places not too far away. Not much flavor and a lot of bread in comparison to lobster meat. I'm in this area of Manhattan often so will give it another shot. Maybe just ironing out the links of having just opened.	3star
Great chill bar! The fish aquarium above the bar is a nice touch, as well as the beautiful serene outdoor garden area. Everything is self serve which can get a little annoying, especially when you are sitting at the end of the bar drinking your beer and ask for a water, and the bartender points at the water cooler on the other end of the bar. Food is good, most bartenders super nice and always a fun crowd.	4star
1/2/2016  1 check-in     Excellent family oriented old fashioned beautiful Italian restaurant! My family and I were there with our 18 month old grandson and everyone there was so accommodating! Service excellent and food outrageously good! These Brooklynites and Staten Islanders will definitely be back.	5star
i saw this restaurant on yelp which is near my house and after looking at people's comment I've decided to order the uni bibimbap, truffle fries, yuzu soda, and tuna mayo. uni bibimbap was below terrible, uni is below edible qualification, something black on top of the rice was so bitter i cant just swallow the bite, the veggies in the bowl just doesnt taste like they should be together in a dish. tuna mayo was... edible, but seriously, drizzled honey on top of the bread to eat with TUNA MAYO? thats kinda weird. the only one decent thing probably be the truffle fries. but to be honest any fries at any fast food restaurant would have been better. yuzu soda was good. money wasted	1star
Very good food! They give you complimentary bread and olives which is nice. I had the homemade squid ink pasta. The texture of the pasta was spongey and yummy. Hefty portion of scallops shrimp squid and mussels. Only $25. Anywhere else in the city would be 30+ for a huge portion like that. Really great quality seafood and the service was excellent. Very nice and attentive. Great experience and dinner overall I really recommend.	5star
This place used to be my go-to place, but it disappointed me so much that I feel compelled to write this review. I ordered through seamless and they never confirmed that they received it. After thirty minutes passed, I had to call five times till they finally picked up. The person said they had no idea where the delivery person is. When I asked how long I had to wait for the delivery as a result of that, the person said I don't know. COME ON! Is this how you responded to customer request? Don't you have to check your own staff/contractor? After I pressed them on an estimated time, there was a long silence AND they simply HUNG UP!!!! This is UNBELIEVABLE!  What's worse?  They confirmed through the seamless portal five min after they hung up on me.  Are you this afraid to talk to your customers when you treat them like dirt? I feel sad to let this place  drop to the bottom of my restaurant list. I WILL NOT order or visit place again in the future and I will make sure all my friends know this place  deserves the ZERO star because of their customer service, not even their exotic food can make up for their horrible attitude and service. There are many better places out there and watch out for your competitors if you wanna survive on your current customer service standard.	1star
One of the most rated places in BK!  Have been twice thus far for the multi course meal and will definitely be back... Food: $50 8-10 course meal available (sharing plates) as well as a regular menu, but I go for the multi-course; you can chose  adventurous or non-adventurous and the dishes change each time you go... they now offer a wine pairing with the tasting menu... 2 reds, 2 whites and 1 dessert wine (an additional $30 I believe - would not recommend if you are a wino)... some of my favorite dishes I had were the pulled pork sandwich and tuna tartare.. on the adventurous menu the only thing I was not a fan of was the fried sweet bread Service: very attentive, friendly staff.. accommodating to any dietary restrictions Ambience: nothing over the top here which is different but the food speaks for itself.. some bar and dining room seating and a patio in the back (haven't been in summer but you can sit in an enclosed space with heat lamps in the winter)	5star
This was a classic taco stand atmosphere!!! Full of Mexicans working and they knew what they were doing!!! I'm from Texas and we get some authentic Mexican food there and this place did not disappoint!!! Great tasting food and decently priced. I would definitely recommend this place.	5star
It was very hot in the establishment. I couldn't eat all my food and my lobster tails were overcooked. And it was fried asked for broiled... $160 really wasn't that Pleasant for the food. Now, Jessica C, was amazing. And did a great job. She did everything to make me and my family happy. ...	1star
We came here for their weekend brunch and left disappointed.  You get to chose 4 tapas, 2 brunch entrees or paella and 1 dessert. With unlimited sangria -- where can you go wrong?  Well.... turns out when the wait staff is rude, you can go a lot wrong.  The quality of the food was pretty decent, one of our tapas didn't come out properly and our waiter didn't even realize.  We also had to constantly flag down our waiter for sangria refills, after a while we just had a glass of ice and when I asked for another glass- seemed like a major inconvenience.  The patatas bravas were pretty bland and the lamb meatballs were very chewy.  We also got an order of the bacon wrapped dates which were delicious.  The paella was also delicious- it's a huge portion but definitely tasty.  The tables are also very close together so it's difficult to get in and out from the table.  It's unfortunate that the staff wasn't pleasant, probably why I won't be back.	2star
I have no problem with service nor atmosphere. My rating is only based on how bad the food taste. I walked into the restaurant expecting for Taiwanese food as it appeared on their name. The reality is that this restaurant has no idea what Taiwanese food is. The beef noodle soup was so bad that I can't bear to take more than few sip. It was water mixed with msg at its very best, an instant noodle from a market will taste better than that. The oyster pancake looks more Korean than Taiwanese with very few oyster. It is quite a disappointment.	2star
First, I will say the new location looks great.. the layout was done very well. My first complaint is is a nothing complaint, we received our drinks from the bar after we received our entrees... whatever.. I had dinner at Sugar Freak 2 days ago, I  finally have the strength to write this review. Everyone in my party of 3 ordered the fried chicken. All 3 of us had terrible diarrhea/vomiting within 6 hours of our meals. I had it the worst and had to take 2 days off from work because of how debilitating the food poisoning was. I called my doctor and he suspects salmonella poisoning.  Needless to say I will be crossing Sugar Freak off my list. I understand the quirks of a newer staff, everyone was lost and stepping on each others toes. But food prep and serving tainted or dirty food is inexcusable. I lost 2 days of work and being immobile with excruciating pain over fucking fried chicken...	1star
The manager said we cannot eat here. We were very offended as we had bought lots of drinks and the other waiter gave us the food menu and we already decided on our food, we found it very rude that we couldn't eat in here, just because someone had a reservation in half an hour. Very disappointing	1star
I visited Casa Enrique at the recommendation of a friend who knows I love Mexican food - I was definitely intrigued by the Michelin star rating! I brought my parents who were visiting and we were there for 7PM reservations on a Sunday. We were sitting right at the front near the door and bar so it was quite loud. There was only one bartender for the entire restaurant so it seemed backed up there. Our waiter seemed a bit off putting to me - quick responses that were a bit dismissive. I had asked if they had elote to order as a side as it was listed elsewhere in the menu with other dishes but I was shut down. We all ordered drinks and guacamole. The guacamole was good, not best I've ever had, but definitely good. We waited around 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive which we finished the guacamole in that time. My dad ordered the mole, my mom the short ribs and I got the fish tacos. The mole and and short ribs were hits for my parents but I wouldn't recommend the fish tacos. They were just like little fish nuggets with no sauce, no seasoning...really strange. I used one of the sauces provided on the table but felt there could have been a better sauce provided for fish tacos specifically. We finished with the tres de leches and the mexican chocolate pot de creme. Definitely recommend the tres de leches, it was great. The Pot de Creme was good but very rich, could have done for half the portion and it was split between the three of us.  Overall, I was kind of disappointed as the star rating had my hopes very high. However, I'd definitely give Casa Enrique another chance -- the actual meals look like the way to go versus the tacos.	3star
Been 5 times, mostly to split an entree and have a drink at the bar. Pasta is good though not enough choices. Beer selection (tap) is limited to 2. Would recommend the burger and the ambience. Probably more like a 3.5 than 4 stars. Wish the barkeeps were a bit more chatty - nothing negative, just don't make you feel like hanging out and being friendly.	4star
I came here with my awesome friend, Greyci, after work on FRIDAY THE 13TH. The staff were very friendly: One in particular had a very sexy French accent ;)The mussels and a bag of bread were my favorite part of the food. The Crostini had decent toppings, but that bread could not be harder. The food was ok overall, only a few things stuck out but what really grabbed my attention was the $12 Happy Hour Special which was a 3 glass Wine Flight of all types (white, rosé, or red). We chose the Naïm Rosé Flight which turned out to be very good. Greyci and I especially liked 2 of the 3 Roses. This place has a sort of modern and retro romantic charm to it. The menus are attached to old records and the bill is given inside of an old paperback book but the lighting, color scheme, and it's simplicity gave off a modern feel. If not for the mediocre food, come to try the drinks, especially the Wine Flight.	3star
Went for a late dinner. Passed by several restaurants because Caledonia was highly rated. Apparently they close the kitchen 5 hours before the bar closes. Might want to add that to your website! Went to use the bathroom before heading out to find another place to eat and manager gave an attitude about it. Asked if he could recommend someplace close by to eat. He said he didn't know of anyplace. Walked out and across the street to another whiskey bar that was still serving food. A crazy idea on a Saturday night! All had a good steak dinner and great drinks. Guess he didn't know that place existed....surely.	1star
Setting is super nice right in Central Park. The food was pricey considering the quality was okay. Service was not overly great.	2star
Had a reservation for 12 for a friends bachelorette party at 7pm on a Saturday night. The reservation was confirmed on the Thursday before when we showed up at 7, the restaurant was completely full and they told us 10 minutes until our table was ready. After waiting for close to half an hour, I went in to check what was happening. They has a table of 6 leaving and told me we could keep waiting for the table next to them, who had just started the meal, so we could push the tables together.  Or they could seat us at separate tables, but either way it would be 10 more minutes. We were on a time constraint and just left to go to a restuarant up the street who was able to take us right away. There was another party of 10 in the same situation we were, who ended up at the same restaurant we went to because their reservation was not accommodated either. The food looked and smelled delicious, but unfortunately I did not get to try it. This whole experience soured me from ever going back, even on a night when time was not an issue, because clearly there is no desire to hold reservations and make sure their customers are taken care of.	2star
Another beautiful restaurant in the meatpacking district.  Scarpetta stands by Italian classics and that's what I appreciate about this place. The Spaghetti is the star of the show - al dente noodles with rich tomatoes and basil and add some grated parmesan...mmmmmm. It was simple yet so sophisticated and it really is possibly the best spaghetti I ever had! I would seriously just stick to this dish.  Some other items: Tuna Susci - very light and crisp. It reminded me of a tuna summer roll. A perfect dish for the spring/summer.  Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti - a bit heavier but nothing extraordinary in my opinion.	4star
Really meh...  I ordered a jap chae (veggie stir fried vermicelli) $11.99 and dolsot bibimbap (rice with mixed veggie) $17.99. They were really just average and to be honest, I don't think they are worth the price. The portion was tiny... Paying nearly $40 for those, not worth it.  If you want better Korean food, probably not here. The japchae isn't the traditional one that I remembered. I ordered tangsuyuk before and I mean, I literally thought I ordered the wrong thing. If the food tasted great and all that, it's fine but nope.  Let's not talk about how rush they were because in average, the restaurants in ktown they like to rush you out like you should pack and eat at home but we gonna still let you sit down when you order so we can get your tip. Yup...	2star
Their brunch is great! We had ropa vieja and vaca fritas, and both were on point. We asked for a side of hot sauce, and I don't know what kind of hot sauce it was (house-made maybe?), but it was the cherry on top of our yummy meals. The sangria is NO JOKE. It's tasty, but it really does pack a punch. It's disappointing that it comes in such large glasses, because I wanted to try them all, but I totally understand why. I was tipsy in no time, and all the mixing of different alcohol + sugar gave me a headache that lasted most of the day :( that won't stop me from doing this again though - especially considering I live in the neighborhood! On the way out, I asked the hostess if reservations are required for brunch, or if some tables are reserved for walk-in... and I was told that reservations are needed. Bummer. I was hoping to maybe pop in one day for an impromptu brunch, but looks like that probably won't happen. So... guess I'll have to plan a few months in advance, like everyone else!	4star
3.5 stars, but I'll have to round down this time. Perhaps I came with too high of an expectation but I left wanting more. We arrived about 15 mins late for our 5pm reservation. We were promptly seated at a booth, which was comfortable and provided a good view of the rest of the restaurant. The spacious interior with hints of modern decor was romantic, calming, and classy. The HH is 4pm-7pm. The drinks on the HH menu were diverse enough for my liking, but I stuck with the pom margarita, which isn't listed on their HH menu - those pom margs were AMAZING. Beautifully presented, great mixology, and perfectly salted and ice cold. Company was happy with his red, which he had several of over the course of dinner.  We both weren't too hungry as we had a late lunch. I'm glad we didn't order an appetizer because the eggplant parm was so much food! It would've been perfect, and I would've pushed it up a star to 5, had it not come out cold. I mean, after all, the food is the most important at a restaurant. The lasagna came out piping hot, so I'm guessing they were trying to serve them at the same time and mine was likely sitting around somewhere waiting to be served. I wish my plate was warm while it waited - I wasn't going to ask them to reheat it. I felt like there was only one waitress working that night - everyone else seemed like they had an assigned task, and we were hesitant to ask for help. Besides, I generally never have to ask a restaurant to heat my food up again! That was a first for me, and it was disappointing enough for my mentioning. And when can a cold eggplant parm ever taste good? Ugh. Our waitress was very nice and helpful in explaining the menu - but again, when the heat turned up as the night went on, we were more reluctant to look for her help. The complimentary bread with the coconut spread was underwhelming, but I actually liked the fact that it didn't taste unnatural. If it was any sweeter, I would've suspected that it was loaded with heaps of sugar and whatever else, so that was an appreciated nice touch.  FiDi is in desperate need of better restaurants, so I'm very happy to see new and more posh establishments settle in.	3star
They have BBQ, if you want to sit and eat, forget about it. Nice place but too many people just occupying all the tables drinking and not eating. Plenty of other places to go for BBQ that are more suitable for groups.	3star
Ordered balls in pesto sauce for takeout.  They were soooo salty.  Each bite tasted like eating a spoonful of salt.  It was not good!  And I usually love salty food. We could not eat much - just way too salty. So had to cook a second dinner after spending $30+ The meal looked nice.  It just tasted awful.   We must have ordered the wrong thing - the place is always packed so there must be something else on the menu that's tasty.	2star
Delicious food and excellent service...even during the busy holiday season. Joe, the bartender, is very congenial. Be sure to say hi.	4star
Was super excited to finally try this spot until we got there and learned they no longer serve the late night burger. major sad face. there was some miscommunication with the server (who said they still had it) so we were offered something else on the house. the customer service is spectacular once they realized their mistake, but the bar food missed the mark. the cacio e pepe which is one of my favorite dishes of all time tasted... weird. the ribs were meh. the desserts were meh.	2star
This is my second time trying Iron Chef Morimoto's restaurants; the first time was the much bigger, grander Morimoto in Chelsea, which I thought was fairly decent but over-the-top expensive. This time around, Momosan is in a much more relaxed setting, and the vibe was certainly more casual and hip, a nice change of scenery coming straight from work.  I was forewarned that the line could get long since they did not take reservation. When I arrived at 6:30 on a clear Thursday night, our party of 4 did not have to wait more than 10 mins. When we were seated, the waitress promptly gave us the attention and swiftly took our orders. Immediately, I knew these guys ran a tight show, and I really appreciated without having to idle at the table. I was excited to try their appetizers: crispy mimiga (pig ear), Chashu Salad, and Okonomiyaki. Among them, the pig ear absolutely stood out for me, and I would highly recommend this to anyone base on its interesting texture - chewy, crunchy and warm! I'm usually a big fan of pork innards and this was quite refreshing to me. The rest of the appetizers were just okay and I would like to think that they are mostly adapted from other regions in Asia such as Korea, Southern China, and Japan. After all, their executive chef is Korean and you can definitely sense the influence in its menu.  I also tried the Tokyo Chicken Ramen, which was supposed to be the lightest of the four ramens. The pieces of chicken were fairly tender and the broth was flavorful without being too oily. For this reason, I needed extra side condiments in mine. Overall, Momosan was delightfully pleasing with its trendy interior and a refreshing menu. I can definitely see myself returning to try other apps and ramens soon!	4star
Great soul food in NYC!!!  I got the chicken with Mac & Cheese and my friend got the Al Sharpton with fried fish.  Everything was delicious and the service was on point.	4star
We went for family style and ordered what seemed to be just about everything on the menu! We had no regrets about this, the Shrwarma, the dumplings or anything else we ordered! The carafes on wine were also huge! We will be back	5star
Very Nice Place.  Horrible Service.  Waited an hour for a BLT.  Come on man.  I would come back but for drinks only.	2star
One of my favorite restaurants in NYC! Every single dish tasted amazing. I came here with no expectations but had heard nothing but raving reviews from friends. Came here on a weekday and put my name down - wait was about ~2hours but they will text you so you can grab drinks elsewhere then come. They also have a private room for special events.  They have a tavern and living room area. The living room area is pre fix I believe and reservations are booked out for months. I got seated in the tavern and it was still really charming! I love love the ambiance, service, and FOOD. Okay now onto the best part- FOOD Ordered the clam flatbread- AMAZING, seriously every single bite I was getting sad that it was disappearing. So crisp and flavorful but not like too salty or anything. Best app for sure!! The Radicchio & Grilled Bacon Salad, Apples and Red Eye Gravy was really fresh and delicious as well. You CANNOT go wrong with any dish honestly. Next time I would def try the cheese. For my entree I got the meatballs. Juicy and great sauce. The sea bass is also REALLY GOOD. I would recommend trying the sea bass. It doesn't look as tasty but once you bite into it- OMG! I really did not think the food could get better after eating the apps but then the entrees blew my mind.  The service is excellent- they also keep your water full and ask if you want any drinks.  For dessert I got the Cookies & Cream Sundae, Chocolate Cookie Crumble and Sherry Sauce - BEST ICE CREAM IVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. SERIOUSLY! If they sold their own cookie and cream ice cream 10/10 I would buy.  For drinks I recommend- JALISCO PEAR- pear alcohol drink- really tasty!  The place is worth the $$$$. I'm coming back asap. Top 5 fav in NYC!	5star
Great place! Dive looking but amazing food and service plus free Jameson shots. Perfect hangout local place with a laid back atmosphere. Check it out when your in a financial district for sure.	5star
If you like a cramped table and expensive pizza, this Village stop is for you. They are a spin off of Joe and Pats of Staten Island, NY and their pizza is just as good.  The mini rice balls are filled with cheesy goodness and they leave you unfulfilled. The vodka pizza was extremely tasty but for $26 it was 2 parts sauce and 1 part cheese. Of course you can get extra cheese.  It is worth a try if you plan on being in the area, but make a reservation. Without one, you will be outside looking in.	3star
We went there for lunch and ordered Zucchini and pasta. The Zucchini dish was only egg some onions. It was expensive and we will not go there anymore.  Very noisy and crowded	1star
I decided to go in here for brunch and was told there is a 20-minute wait for a table. That was understandable so I put my name down. I was about to go sit at the bar but the host told me I can't since there was only one bar seat and there were two of us. Um, ok one of us could have stood but fine.  We asked him to call us when our table is ready and left. After walking around for about 30 minutes we get a call from the host saying he has two bar seats for us. This irritated me when we clearly needed a table and I told him we need a table, not bar seats. Then the host tells us it's another 30 mins. Seriously? This was 4th of July weekend and none of the places were crowded so I couldn't tell if he was being an ass or not but if you treat your customers like they're so disposable I would not want to give you my business.	1star
"Been here twice.  The first time it was two of us, me and a friend. We were able to get seated in less than 25 mins because there were only two. I give a rating of 2-3 for the food. 4 for the service.  The second it was a party of 4, it took us over an hour to get seated. Don't come here if you don't like waiting especially on the weekends. This place is FLOODED with tourists, and annoying hipsters that are easing into dim sum. Food was still ok. I've had better and probably won't be eating here again. There are plenty of other places in Chinatown to eat better dim sum.  Advice: Up the quality of some of the ""basic"" dimsum items-soup dumplings, chicken feet, baked pork buns, pork shumai"	2star
"So this place has a bird problem.  You'll discover it quickly if you sit in the lovely garden as we did today. You will be sitting, perhaps chatting with a friend, when the pooping will begin.  We saw the woman next to us get crapped on, and we thought, ""that's too bad,"" and then we started to get crapped on.  It turns out that this lovely garden space with its fountain is a bird-magnet, and we all know that birds love to bathe and love to poop.  All of this to say, I can't recommend sitting outside.  Then again, I can't really recommend sitting inside either.  As many have said, the service is leisurely, which would be fine if the food were extraordinary, but I had exactly what I normally get at Black Iris on Dekalb-- the veggie platter-- and I can honestly say Black Iris is about 500x better. Beoduin featured tasteless beets, very sour baba ghanoush, teeth-chatteringly cold grape leaves, and some fine tabbouleh.  It is true that Bedouin is cheap, and that their warm puffy pita is delightful, but everything else is just mediocre."	2star
The first one we went to was the west side one. At first I didn't care too much for it, but that was my own fault. Didn't mix the broth well enough. Towards the end of it tho, it tasted really good. OH, the steamed bun things are really good! They have this spicy mayo sauce in it that really hits the spot. Then a few nights later, we went to the east side one. This one didn't have as great customer service, but this can be easily remedied with really good food and so that's what they did. The broth was nice and spicy, just how I like it. Every bite warmed by body and soul. Only bad thing was that my body and soul were already overheating since NY is a thousand degrees right now and this place did not have good AC or circulation. Every bite was confusing: so delicious, yet so painfully hot. Yet I could not stop. Slurped that baby down to the bottom.  It wasn't just me either, my gf got up from her seat to leave and she left gross thigh sweat marks on the seat. Oh well.	5star
"Yes, the hype is real. The ramen really is delicious and the wait really is long. I recently came here with 4 friends on a Sunday night. We were told that a wait for 5 people would be about 3 hours. They let us leave a cell phone number. We were pleasantly surprised when they called about an hour and a half later saying that someone had canceled and they could fit us in. We returned to the restaurant and were promptly seated. The inside of the restaurant has a super trendy, but also casual vibe. The interior decorating is gorgeous. We had three vegetarians in our group so we were thrilled to see that the menu had 5 different vegetarian ramen options. Every other ramen place I've been to have only had one. It was THE vegetarian ramen. It was so overwhelming I had to ask for guidance to navigate my choices.  After placing our orders, our server informed us that the kitchen had ""run out"" of tofu and couldn't put any in our ramen. I know one of the big draws of Ippudo is their fresh ingredients and that they don't keep frozen tofu in large frozen stashes in the back. However, for such an established and reputable restaurant, it was shocking that they wouldn't have enough tofu for a pretty standard Sunday evening on a cold windy winter day. It was disappointing, but our server let us substitute the tofu with an extra protein product, in my case an extra hard boiled egg. I would have to make do.  The ramen itself, despite its lack of tofu, was excellent. I can't hate on it even though I had really wanted tofu. The broth was unlike any ramen I had ever had. It was a very rich flavor. You also have the option of having your noodles softer or harder as you prefer. I opted for the standard firmness and it was perfect.  Overall, I can't wait to return to have some ramen with tofu next time. I will choose a warmer day so I can enjoy a warm Manhattan evening while I wait for a spot at this tremendously (and justifiably) popular restaurant."	4star
"The extrior was pretty neat, the inside was somewhat a wide but close space.  They give you towels to ""wash"" your hands, so you don't need to go to the restroom. The host was pretty awkward and not as friendly (? Lol) He would refill your water and the second time he did, he kind of slammed the glass on the table hard and I was abit frazzeled. The server was okay, he just didnt seem to get my question about the serving sizes which was weird, he kept saying it was only this much bigger as if I came here before...  The people who worked there were walking around a lot in a  closed space, and it was prerry awkward... The duck soba was at least $21.75 The soba had small cut pieces in the serving basket(?) Like leftover small ones.  It was greasy and you couldnt bite it into two pieces, its a little bit of a big piece and the broth was alright...  My friend got the regular soba and her broth was like soy sauce and water... Lol.... The green tea cream brulee was unforunately the only good thing there"	2star
I ordered my wings for pick up and it took them longer than expected. Then, they called and said they are delivering my wings. I asked how? I never gave you my address and am in front of your restaurant. It was the worst! When I got the wings, they were cold and not even crunchy!	1star
I came with a large group on a Sunday night. I really wanted to like them as they had a nice display of fresh pasta making near the front entrance, and it seemed better than the other places on that street. But it's rather a disappointment.  All the pasta had a gnocchi texture to it and weren't al dente. The pesto sauce had a weird bright green oil with it that looked like Vulcan blood. The cocktails were the worst, we ordered the Mulberry and East Side and both looked Kool Aid (red and green, respectively) with not much alcohol in them. The best thing we had for the night were the bread sticks!  The service was good, especially considering we had a large group, with a couple of kids, and we were loud.  Overall, I won't be returning as there are much better options for pasta in NYC, maybe not in that neighborhood, but there are definitely better options a couple of subway stops away.	2star
The Smith is pretty good, giving it a three since We found the food to be inconsistent for the price.  The atmosphere was good and the service was great.   We started with the Mac, which was very tasty, creamy and cheesy.  I got the burger and fries.  Burger was very good, fries though we're kind of limp and cold.   My partner got the fried chicken special.  Unfortunately, his chicken was cold, the staff was very easy about it and returned with hot chicken.  It seemed like they were just trying too hard and the chicken was subpar, not a lot of flavor and the breading wasn't necessary.  It came with half a waffle that just tasted weird.  Overall, I would go again, just not on the top of my list.  Price is also too much for the food. There are better burgers out there and definitely better chicken than the $27 one here!	3star
"Was visiting my sister in LIC, so decided to try this place out. Witnessed a motorbike vs cab collision but I won't count that against this establishment (no one was injured). The seating is limited but well worth the wait. Best ramen I've had in a while (tried both the Shoyu and the Tonkatsu with additional poached eggs), comparable to Ippudo, but disappointed by the size of some of the dishes: -""The Sammy"" is a very flavorful pork sandwich but was consumed in 2 bites -the stuffed chicken contains a piece of foie gras but NOT worth $8 a piece Would definitely come again for the ramen!"	4star
After Fetti Sau prices surged, we went in a wild search for some good Que and we found it, the brisket here is amazing and the ambiance is very welcoming. My favorite eats are: *brisket *turkey *pulled pork  * Italian sausage *collard greens and coleslaw Great service and great food a must for BBQ lovers.	5star
"Terrible experience with entry to this place. Place wasn't full and they are ""holding the door"" on a 20 degree day?!? Must be cuz they don't need the business. Tony and Jamie at the door said they are being door protectors to a packed place, but wait.....no one else waiting at the door! And peaking in shows a not so full place. Jamie didn't wanna give me her name either, so hope that's worth it. Owners of the place beware. Maybe your people are turning away business for no reason? And how hospitable on a below freezing day after the snow. I hope your supposed hype lives up to sustainable business. I also turned away 6 people that came after me cuz your hosts pissed me off ;-) good luck!"	1star
Before I get into the food, I would like to strongly encourage you to make reservations!! Carmines is such a popular spot that you can't make reservations the same day. At least try to make it a couple days to a week in advance or you'll suffer a very long wait for a dinner table.  Once our group got a spot for dinner after more than 2 hours of waiting, it's safe to say we were very hangry. So, we ordered 2 fried calamari appetizers and 3 pasta dishes: penne alla vodka, shrimp scampi, and veal parmesan. Now, everything at Carmines is served as family style. So, the amount we ordered was sufficient to feed our party of 10. For a restaurant this popular, you would think their food was out of this world delicious. But, it was just good. I do have to say my favorites would have to be the calamari and the penne alla vodka. The calamari tasted fresh and wasn't overly battered. The marinara sauce that went with it was also fresh and had a punch to it. As for the penne all vodka, the pasta had a good al dente texture and the sauce was creamy and flavorful.  The ambience here is lively because it always seems to be crowded. It makes sense because it's in the theater district, where people usually eat dinner and catch a show afterwards. Prices at this restaurant are also quite steep for what they give you. But, it is New York City. So, if you want to bring a large group of people to a family style Italian restaurant, come to Carmines and check them out (with reservations, of course).	3star
I came here on a Sunday for brunch the host looked very tired/ hungover not friendly at all. In my opinion the food was tasty but overpriced. You can probably get the same Peruvian brunch in Queens for half or even 1/3 of the price.	2star
I walked past Fishmarket while trying to find it! Very unassuming spot. My visit was a few weeks ago on a Wednesday about 6pm. We were the first ones there but the place actually filled up soon after despite it being a rainy, dreary day. The menu consists of a ton of comfort foods that I love and was excited to try -- Scallion pancakes -- these were so thin and crispy. I usually prefer my scallion pancakes to have more chew but these were still satisfying.  Curried Chicken -- this was some of the best curry ever. I prefer my curry thicker and super spicy and this did not disappoint. The chicken was so tender and the potatoes atop were crispy! Fish Tacos -- this was our least favorite dish of the evening. The fish tacos were loaded with slaw and each contained 3 popcorn sized fish pieces in each. The fries were also soggy. Crispy fried Rice -- the favorite of the night! I've never had fried rice quite like this before. Each bite had crispy bits! If you're like me and like to scrape the bottoms of clay pot rice or bibimbaps, then totally order this! Prices were on point. Service was fine. They even offered us shots of Jameson before we left. I'd come back in a heartbeat to try more items and of course more curried chicken and fried rice!	4star
Hi Visited this new place yesterday. Had the anchovies and onion. Very nice. The pasta is home made so is very fresh and all the ingredients are fresh. The menu is very simple, only eight dishes to pick from but i like that concept. It is small and there are only a few stools so this place is geared towards takeouts. For the price and quality i think it is great value and it wonderful to have them in the neighborhood.	5star
Tempted to have Filipino food and found this place around the work area. Order the pork belly bun, chicken taco and kimchee fried rice burritos. The space is small and the service wasn't that good. The Pork bun was too acidic, and it wasn't tender enough . It would have been for a taco, the chicken taco on the other hand though was not bad. And as for kimchee fried rice burrito, it didn't have much kimchee in it. The chicken was probably the only authentic food.	3star
Was there to attend an event / class.  Pros:  Nice common facilities, nice view on the top level and nice gracious staff overall.  Cons:  Rude elder lady at the reception. If you're so unhappy serving, girl you need to find another job - please, for all of us!	3star
One of the worst meals we've had in all of Brooklyn. Can't believe this place gets anything but trashed on yelp.  First, don't come here if you want to actually have a conversation with the people you are with. The music is pointless, doesn't set any kind of mood, but it is LOUD LOUD LOUD. I'm not one to usually comment about the volume of a restaurant, but we could barely hear the people we were with and I am hoarse today from having to shout to just have a basic conversation with old friends. Not an auspicious entry. Started out with the slowest, most lackadaisical service I've ever encountered. 20 minutes before we could flag someone down to take a drink order, another 20 minutes before the drinks arrived...We had to leap at waitstaff throughout the meal to get any service whatsoever. The cocktails were icky - the rum quality was questionable, the options were limited. Oh, it's a wine bar, you say, so why are you ordering cocktails? Well, when we moved to wine, we were steered towards a particular bottle by the waitress. Holy crap, it was absolutely undrinkable! It tasted like a cough drop and a package of nails were melted down and served to us. Is there someone actually in charge of ordering at this place or are they just taking whatever is available on steep discount? And to the food. The short rib that CLEARLY wasn't actually a short rib and couldn't have looked less appealing upon arrival. The grainy, plain ricotta dish. The fish with teeny tiny bones throughout (though some had been removed, so it was a surprise when you got a mouthful), the poorly cooked brussels sprouts, the merguez and squid with the white beans that were undercooked, and last but not least, the only highlight, the chicken liver pate, which I doubt they even prepared.   I have never, ever been steered so wrong by a yelp review. This place is AWFUL in every respect.	1star
I'm sorry - bad service negates good food in my book. Our waitress was ice-cold to the start - never checking in with us and unable to crack a smile.  Okay...whatever.  We're boring, simple people that never cause any problems.  Cool.  What annoyed us was the following -  We ordered the dips ($16) that came with complimentary bread.  Note that everyone already receives complimentary bread.  So when the spreads couldn't accommodate the 1st piece, we naturally asked for another.  Boom - charged extra for that and we got an attitude when we asked. Okay.  No biggie - but being that we sat next to a table that was getting complimentary appetizers valued at $16 and extra attention...you can't give us an extra piece of bread that was supposed to be free anyway? We're already dropping $80 on a meal, so a piece of bread shouldn't seem like a big deal.  But whatever.   I'll go to Kefi instead.  Thanks.	1star
Came here last week for lunch. We were seated in the dinning area, which is more intimate and refined area of the establishment.  We ordered a bottle of wine with lunch, which was nice. I ordered the roasted chicken. All the food was excellent.  Note: The menu in the tavern area (not dinning) serves a completely different menu, more like a tavern menu as opposed to the dinning menu they serve in the back area and private dinning area. I did not know this.	5star
Extremely nice staff and I love the atmosphere! Food is great and best of all was the chicken pot pie soup	5star
Went here with friends for bday brunch. I regret for not getting the waffle with fried chicken. I decked to get smoked salmon and salad and eggs instead. I think the hot eggs cooked the salmon so it tasted weird. I didn't enjoy it and the wait was not worth it. However our waiter was super nice and we had a good girls brunch. Maybe if I had tried the waffle, I might have given more stars	3star
Update on 9/11/17 Y'all - I can't with place anymore. They've been open for two years and still can't manage to keep rats, mice and gnats out of the restaurant. Feel free to visit   to search for yourself.  Original post I was incredibly excited to try the food. This spot has been busy every night I pass by it! I ordered the meatball sub and sweet potato fries to go. 36 minutes later, I walked out with an average sized bag of food. After arriving home, I opened up the bag to find an exceedingly small portion of food. The sub was uneventful, dry, and underwhelming. However, the sweet potato fries and the sauces that came with it were delicious. Perhaps I did not order the right item, but there are a number of better restaurant options in the Greenwich Village area.	1star
I've been a long time fan of this place forever but went this evening and had the worst time! Perhaps all new employees/management. The margaritas were the worst I've ever had. We requested different ones round 2 thinking they were just a bad batch but all were terrible. Little to NO alcohol. Food was mediocre. Guac was good but nothing special. My boyfriends enchiladas were fine. I had the al pastor tacos which were small but nothing but salt. All in all, very disappointed and unfortunately would never return.	2star
Ok. Your Boston-based high school has a satellite reunion in a second floor gallery under the High Line that is currently hosting a one-woman mixed media show including a long glass display case of ombre'd pink plastic things, a giant photoshopped labia and some sort of huge pearl decorative sculpture thingy. There are also a cluster of ceramic snake-y things, and some super large calligraphy-type drawings. You are out of your league and might be wearing leg warmers, as you've come from the gym and it's cold as balls out. The wine and beer flows freely, the cheese is serious and the charcuterie thoughtfully chosen. You talk to the headmaster. Now mind you, he wasn't the headmaster when you were at school but he's a headmaster. Feelings happen. Nerves set in. Mini brownies are consumed in terrifying quantity. And the only solution is several post-reunion martinis. You know, so you can scream The Cranberries into the night sky and wonder why you didn't become a performance artist.  Naturally, because the other option is to walk into the Hudson, one ends up post fete at the Cookshop. And one drinks more. In order not to court complications with the law or seat mates, one orders a potato pizza and splits it three ways. It's not bad; like, quite-not-bad. And this is very good because the calories are necessary. JR (did y'all know that JR means junior but is pronounced Jay Arrrr? No? Well now you do!) is a cheerful bartender with a never ending supply of banter, garnishes and good wit. Go on. Have a couple of drinks. And get that pizza.	3star
Outside seething was great. But our server was awful. All we wanted was a to sit and drink and enjoy the weather. Our waiter ignored us for 20 Minutes, finally we got his attention. It took another 10 minutes to bring us the wrong bottle of wine. We ended up getting a new waiter who was much better.  Wouldn't come here again, there are plenty of restaurants that offer better service in a 1 block radius.	2star
Nice NYC bar in Hell's Kitchen. Burger is decent and fries ok. The eggplant chips are very good. Nice atmosphere. Drinks a little bit on the pricey side but cocktails are very good!	4star
I had high hope of this place but ended up being extremely disappointed on various levels.  The outdoor area is very relaxing, but that's pretty much the only positive highlight.  The main problem was the quality of the food and drinks.  We ordered buffalo wings and baby back rib, two very common bar food and actually the hottest items on their menu.  However, the final products were far from acceptable. Both the buffalo wings and the baby back rib were burned with very obvious chars on the skins.  As a result, both items were overly dry and tasteless.  The buffalo wings were not spicy at all, and the rib was simply bland.  We could have gone to Ruby Tuesday or Applebee's for much better buffalo wings and ribs.   The chardonnay tasted like vinegar, indicating that the bottle might have been opened for a long time.  The beer from Canada was ok (I forgot the brand name because I was consumed by the disappointment with the food), but the beer can was very dusty on the surface.  They did not even bother to clean the can a little before serving it.   We will not go back to this place again in the future.	1star
Glasserie used to be my favorite restaurant in NYC for the first year it was open. Unfortunately it is no longer the case. The last visit was so disappointing that I won't be back. For a group of 6 people we ordered 3/4s of the menu and only 2 dishes were good (not perfect). Glasserie used to be a kind of soul food, interesting combinations that were both original and umami-laden. This time it was the opposite, the dishes looked amazing but tasted bland. Everything was drowned in unnecessary sauces and suffered from too many ingredients, too little balance. Some dishes were just inedible, like the absolutely bland corn flan in a lamb broth (sounds great, tasted like cardboard) So sad to see this place go.	2star
"We came here for a late lunch expecting the Israeli cuisine that my wife and I always miss.  Our initial disappointment was when we found most of their dishes were not served during brunch.  We did not know when we reserved, but we were their last table so as we were debating what to order, waiters kept giving us annoying looks and gestures. We finally ordered two brunch dishes and asked for a side of hummus.  We were told they have a shortage (!!!) of hummus and we could only get it if we ordered the sampler dish that had two other ingredients that we were not interested in.  After some back and forth (that included a lot of attitude from our waiter) we gave up and asked to have the whole sampler dish, simply because we REALLY wanted to try the hummus.  Our waiter said the kitchen stopped taking orders and that we should have been ""more flexible if we wanted to try things at this time"".  Our dishes were far from great.  My wife's dish was a bland omelet and they included olives in it even though she asked them no to.  My eggs were overly made (I asked over easy and they were well done).  Our waiter never asked us how the food is.  Instead, he commented - ""I see you DID like the food eventually because you ate it"".  I told him we did not love it and were simply very hungry and before a flight and he did not respond. Overall, a terrible experience - especially for over $80 for two people for brunch!  I actually emailed the restaurant and complained and they answered a very diplomatic email that we should have known not to come at brunch.  I'll elaborate and say we should not have come at all."	1star
Had lunch here on a Saturday afternoon, besides the construction they were doing next to our table the service was good and attentive. The food was alright, I had the ginger stir-fry with seafood and it was pretty bland, didn't really tasted much of the Thai flavors. My wife had the pad-see-yu with the vegetarian duck. This was tastier and the veggie duck had a good texture to it but the noodles were a bit soggy. Our friend had a curry, I didn't taste it but she liked it.  So overall, this new place is okay, I'm sure they'll find their stride after a few more weeks.	3star
Awesome little neighborhood gem! The restaurant tends to have a very long wait though, so arrive with patience, but it's well worth it. The food is delicious, plentiful, affordable and tastes fresh. The wait staff is great too and they don't rush you out at all. This is the kind of place you go back to over and over (especially for seafood, that's their specialty).	5star
Great noodles that taste like the best of homemade. Careful with the spice level, it can get mouth burning, but the spice has flavor rather than solely scorching the taste buds.  The only thing holding Xi'an back from 5 stars is the meat. The beef can't hold up to the flavor of the noodles. It's soft and flavorful, but isn't the focal point of the dish.	4star
It's unfortunate..... we come here often..... the food is great, but do not come when they have a semi full house. The service suffers..... 20 minutes to get a drink, 15 minutes to get our salads, and God knows how much longer for the entrees..... We are locals, but, won't cine back for dinner or weekend brunch.	2star
My least favorite meal of the trip. Everything about it was terrible except the corn. It was cramped, it was slow, and the service wasn't great. All the food were sub-par to average. The corn was a little on the better side. One of the friend ordered a soda and said it had no air/bubbles in it. We told the waitress, she didn't seem to care and didn't feel sorry about it at all.  I don't get the whats the rave about this place but I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.	2star
Okay.. where do I start? Hmm.. well service is okay... is it the best. no, is it absolutely awful no... on par of a normal restaurant in NYC.  Wait time.. okay.. we got served pretty quickly. Décor ?  not much to speak about.. you come in eat and leave.. really nothing to look at. However from a cost perspective and food quality perspective, these two areas where I have to give below average to poor marks.  From a dim sum perspective, you are better off taking a trip to flushing or downtown Manhattan in Chinatown and getting your Dim Sum fix there. Why do I say that? Here are three reasons: 1) We ordered the Roast Pork Bun and 2 of the 3 was lukewarm. seriously???  for people who had it before and know the product, steam roast pork buns needs to be served piping hot. Not sure what happen there but it was an epic fail IMO 2) We ordered the Fried Taro/Carrot Cake and guess what? couldn't even taste the taro/carrot bits in the cake. All I tasted was a lot of dough ... a lot of dough. Beginning to think we have an apprentice chef in the kitchen making this or worse, it might of been fried right out from a pre-packaged configuration.   3) Finally when we saw our bill, they charged 8 dollar for a small pot of tea ? WTF are you guys thinking here (Most dim sum joints only charge 2-3 dollars at most for a pot of tea)? Are you guys a French restaurant or a pastry café where you can get away with charging that? No.. you guys are a run of mill dim sum restaurant so please don't try to be anything else but that please.. its effing embarrassing. Again, I am trying to wrap my head on why people are giving this place high marks.. I really don't get it. Maybe a lot of folks who eat here are un-iniitated to eating good quality dim sum products but IMO, if you really crave dim sum  (or never had dim sum before) and need a bad fix and do not want to travel for it in the midtown area, I guess you can try this place but if you want  good quality dim sum, would look elsewhere for it.	2star
If you visit for Happy Hour, you better be at the door waiting to open.  The seating will be full by 15 minutes after.  You even have customers holding bar seats. The reason for 1 STAR...... We asked front hostess if we could sit near bar to enjoy Happy Hour bar snacks.  When the server came to the table, we ordered our happy hour drinks. After we ordered some bar snacks. Server then tells us that we can not order bar snacks because that's only at the bar. But we got happy hour drinks. Go figure!  When asked, can order bar snacks at bar and bring back to table? Server said no you have to be at the bar. WHAT! Had our drinks and left......  Will NEVER come back.	1star
My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary and it was perfect! My boyfriend had the chicken and red velvet waffles and I had the ribs with mac and cheese which was AMAZING! Our waiter was extremely accommodating and answered all of my million questions. The drinks were different but in a good way. I am definitely looking forward to going back again soon.	5star
"A brisk touch of the soul: true food for the barbecue lover with some twists  Having already waited an hr for Brooklyn Crab, we diverted our eyes to this Hometown neighbor that was also buzzing. Waited 30min on a late Saturday night, some of their stuff was out like lamb belly but they do seem to try to replenish if they can.  The brisket is the star of the show. 1/2 lb gets you about 1 thick slice of tender buttery deliciousness. Although I prefer my brisket a bit more smoky, this was spot on southern BBQ. You know it's quality when the leftovers eaten the next day are still so moist and succulent. Ribs - good. Not exactly fall in love off the bone, but better than average.  Vietnamese hot wings are OK. You could go without it. Very forgettable. The ""ranch"" sauce is a huge mismatch.  Texas queso Mac and cheese is awesome. Usually I prefer more contrasting textures, but 5 stars for taste. Definite must get.  Collard greens - passing grade. Get it if you need your veggies to digest the carnivore splurge.  Corn bread - disappointing considering the great barbecue. I wouldn't get again unless you really want your cornbread. Side note: tastes better if you reheat over stove next day for it to caramelize.  I think what sets this joint back from full-on glory are their barbecue sauces. I'm really not impressed. I would choose other sauces if I could. Their hot and sweet sauce has good spicy profile (just a slight zing) but it doesn't elevate the food.  Bottom line: a taste of southern love in the north that I'm coming back for more (brisket, mac and cheese)!"	4star
"Maybe the most relaxed ""fine dining"" ever. As soon as I walked in, the warm & easy vibe was immediate & engulfing.  The bar was particularly inviting; it was almost too bad my table was ready early.   The prix fixe menu has a few options in each course so that there's little chance of not finding something that appeals to you.   From the amuse bouche to the complimentary chocolates at the end of the meal, this dinner was delicious & impressive.  The house rolls were hard to resist.  The crab spaghetti was surprisingly unique & light.  Both the black bass & the flounder were artfully prepared, but the flounder was the star.  Moist, flaky, tender, silky...this fish practically melted in my mouth.  Exquisite.  And then, GT surprisingly succeeded in topping off a perfect meal, w an unforgettable dessert. Matcha ""cheesecake."" They use the term ""cheesecake"" loosely here.  Just as the waiter explained beforehand, it is more like a mousse.  The lightest, silkiest, & creamiest mousse you've ever had in your life!  The first spoonful stopped my thoughts.  It's a showstopper...visually & gastronomically. This is one of the best desserts I have ever had.  A highlight of my NYC trip. I understand why everyone loves it here. A perfect meal. 5 stars."	5star
Terrible empanadas de pollo for the price! One they were small, second they were cold in the middle (microwave) for a Restaurant really! Third I found a chicken bone in them... what they don't know how to make sure so not one client chokes on it. Terrible. I will never return and don't recommend it either!	1star
"We came to have a nice dinner. We ordered tuna poke ball and mussels. Food was nice but nothing special. So why I giving 3 stars??? -- bec of a mean hostess. My bf came and seat at near free table! He was going to order and eat, but that hostess run like ""you can't seat here"" and then we asked can he seat at another available table, she sad NO to(she didn't offer options)... it was plany of available tables and maybe the way she sad wasn't nice and professional"	3star
I'm not saying that it is bad, I'm just saying that I experienced better... I saw the potential for a romantic vibe, but I really felt the this is a popular spot/crowded atmosphere. It gets a bit noisy. Get here early or definitely get a reservation.  If you are here early and waiting for your guests (they only seat full parties), try the bubbly flights which was nice. Wine flights should become more mainstream. I do not recall any happy hour offerings. I ordered the truffle gnocchi. I had high expectation due to the reviews. It didn't meet the high standards that I was expecting. The wow factor never came. The taste of the food is similar to what other reviewers have written. My friend had the dinner special with the salmon pasta which was more flavorful. I would recommend the salmon pasta for future guests.	3star
This place was a life saver we came here on valentines day after leaving a restaurant where the food was so nasty and the service was bad, the atmosphere here in lobster pound  was great and cozy food was nice and fresh and the music they was playing was my kind of music old skool r&b I was shock, the bathroom mirrors had me tripping they had the fun house mirrors,all around the bathroom made my eyes go Cockeyed I would definitely go here a again, they put hershey kiss candies on the table which is my favorite, my Seabreeze magarita was nice and strong just the way I like it ....I would definitely recommend this place	5star
I do not know why I have not heard about this place. I'm around Chinatown a lot but have never seen this place until yelp!  Came here on a Friday evening. This place is a hole in a wall. It is small and there are not a lot of seating. They have high tables with tall stools. I like how they have so many different kinds of hot sauce you can try.  We ordered the original burger, steak taco, pork belly taco, breakroom fries and passion fruit lemonade. My favorite is the steak taco. It has good flavors. I would recommend the breakroom fries but it is spicy. It has tater tots, fries, bacons, jalapeños and a egg. I asked for the jalapeño to be on the side but they threw it in the fries anyways. My boyfriend liked the burger. He said it was pretty good.  Overall this place is a good place to stop by to grab a quick bite/snack. The prices were reasonable and the food came out fast.	4star
"First negative review here ever. Took 12 long emails and phone calls with four of their employees over the course of two weeks to get an inaccurate charge of $20 back and a brief apology. They will finally refund the $20! So happy the process is over. I was even asked to provide detailed contact information of the friends I was with - even though the information about my card, name and exact time of lunch was known. In the culture I come from, we say ""innocence until proven guilty."" Not at Tiny's where a $20 inaccurate charge led to a cascade of emails etc for a customer to provide evidence. Wow. At least a brief apology on phone from their manager, so thank you for that!"	1star
This Chinese owned restaurant used to be good a few years ago when they had Japanese chefs working at the counter. But since a year or two, they have lost those chefs and it has gone down in quality.  These days, Chinese chefs are commanding and making sushi with plastic gloves (no great sushi Master would use those) at the counter.  Taste is still decent but nothing like before.	2star
"I just left and I did not like the deal for the waitress name ""Luz"". Previous I went and a young girl name ""Ana"" took care of us very well and that's why I came back, but today it was not so the bartender was that I did not bring the food."	1star
The food is fair, but the service is generally bad if you aren't a known regular.  I recommend to go into Midtown and go to one if the hundreds of other bars!	2star
My friend and I had dinner here last night as part of Restaurant Week. I thought it was a great deal because the portions were extremely plentiful! Their Restaurant Week menu includes a snack to share, appetizer, entree, dessert, and a side of either jasmine or coconut rice. Here is what we ordered: Snack: Chicharron Appetizer: Her: Burmese eggplant salad / Me: Grilled Pork Jowl Entree: Her: Khao Soi / Me: Shan Noodles Dessert: Her: Ricotta Donuts / Me: Turon Side: Coconut Rice for each of us  Overall, the food was really good! To me, the standouts were the chicharron (it came with a yummy lime sauce), the pork jowl (perfectly cooked and came with brussels sprouts and onions) and the ricotta donuts--these were simply PERFECT. The texture and flavor and ricotta dip was all just amazing. I was seriously surprised at how good these were. Get these donuts!! The coconut rice was also insanely delicious and came in big bowls. We were too full to eat much of it so I took both of them home!  Both the Khao Soi and Shan Noodles were tasty but I actually enjoyed the other parts of the meal more. The Khao Soi was pretty spicy and the Shan Noodles could have used more spice. I squeezed some lime on them and that made them better. Again, I was impressed by the portions of everything--I hate it when Restaurant Week portions are tiny! I'd like to have tried the ribs and somewhat regretted my choice of entree though.  The ambiance is fun and relaxed, and they have a large covered backyard. It's not too loud and everyone is full of smiles and super friendly. However, we were seated right by the bathroom, at a dark and extremely cramped table in the corner, and kind of hidden by the bar. We also weren't able to sit across from each other because one of the chairs would have been blocking the bathroom door. I ended up sitting at the end and awkwardly facing other diners. It took us a few minutes just to get seated and situate our coats and purses in the small space. The three tables lining the back are also VERY close to each other. We almost requested to move to the backyard (it's covered and heated), but decided to stay in the end. I think they should just eliminate this table though. Service was great up until towards the end of our meal, but to be fair, it seemed like our waiter was covering quite a few tables, both in the main area and in the backyard. He was very friendly and was great for most of the meal. My only complaint was that it took a while for him to see that we were done with our entrees, but when he came over to clear the table for dessert, he offered us each a glass of whiskey as compensation for sitting at that little table! He came back with, again, two generous glasses of whiskey! This totally made up for it. I had a great meal here and it's totally worth it for Restaurant Week!	4star
A cool ramen and same restaurant that's good for after work dinners with a friend or a date. There's a bar in front, as well as shared long tables and group tables in the back. It's a but noisy even on a weekday. Recommend: tantan ramen	3star
Solid. The tacos are the best in the neighborhood (esp. the pork taco on corn  ), I love all the options for garnishing, and the people who work here are all as nice as can be.   If this is what having a taco stand on every corner looks like, then bring it on!	5star
Vegetarians. Just don't go here. Not many options and when they try to help you they rip you off.  Asked for a side of noodles and they charged me 9 bucks for a toddler sized serving. So #%^*ing frustrated.  ****	1star
I cant speak for the restaurant but I attended their pig roast a couple of weeks ago  and was flabbergasted that the pig ( supposedly from Flying Pig Farms) was totally dry and tasteless and not cheap ! I cant fathom how they even served it !	1star
"The portion of the food is petite and ""bite size"" friendly. Nevertheless, the food there is really good. I ordered three dishes and all of them tasted over-my-expectation. First, all the food were dished up beautifully and were garnished with the appropriate sides. Second, the ingredients were fresh. Third, I just love how them prepare their alcohol! That was really creative and eye catching!! In addition, the services were amazing with detailed explanation on each question I have! Plus, the waiters were CUTE!!!! Lolz  The cozy, snug, romantic, private, and delightful atmosphere of the restaurant is good for any occasions. Except for big group gathering. You need to reserve ahead of time."	5star
Dev and Chef Jeff were right. Amazing tacos. Living in SoCal we have some of the World's Best Tacos so I'm always skeptical. The Adobada (pork, but not carnitas) taco is special. Definitely get at least one of those. The carne asada was good, too, but it's not different than anything I've had. Good if you don't have a million taco stands where you live but just ok for a neighbor of Mexico and former East LA resident.  That said, I'd say Los Tacos #1 is certainly a nice stop in NYC on your foodie Master of Noneing trip.	5star
"We got some rolls at at Saturday flea market and they were delicious. My chipotle mayo BLT lobster roll was served with warm, soft, buttery bread. The bacon was a thick slice and the saltiness gave flavor to the tomato slices and iceberg lettuce. The mayo had a touch of spice that added a little zing. Oh, but the large hunks of succulent lobster claws were the stars of the show. Portion size wasn't very large, but this was only $10. DH got the Connecticut style roll ($16) with melted butter. He says, ""It was very fresh. The buttered bread and buttered lobster were a delicious combo."" However, he wished they put some chopped celery in it instead of the chives."	5star
Cask is a cute after-work bar space that serves up some pretty good bar eats.   I can't comment on the drinks since I don't drink alcohol.   They are on the smaller side so it is definitely wise to make reservations if you are coming in a group.	3star
I LOVE! We were supposed to go to a different dinner spot that night but the wait was 2 hours. So we walked in here instead and it was only an estimated 45 minutes? I mean waiting sucks in general. The host was walking around, hooking up his friends, he seemed like an organized mess. He was keeping tabs on who was there first and was really accommodating. I'm not a fan on how it's run, but we had a party of 4. We bought a bottle of white wine to get us by the wait.  I was literally so tired of waiting, especially after a day of site seeing. So finally, it's like 10PM and it's our turn! We get seated and order quickly. Almost all my sisters and I ordered the hanger steak. This is definitely on the pricier side but I didn't care, we were starving! In California, you don't usually eat this late! But this steak, ordered medium, was perfectly made. It was so tender, it was flavorful, completely mouth watering. It was literally one of the best I've ever had. All the bad thoughts of waiting just faded away.  We were stuffed. But we couldn't pass on the dessert!! AHh it was also absolutely delicious. The flour-less chocolate cake with ice cream was to die for. I'm excited just thinking about it! Extra Virgin provides great food and OK service. But what else can you expect on a Saturday Night Dinner in NY?	5star
Yummy! Delicious thin crust pizza! I have to agree with everyone- the vodka pizza is great. The selection for their pastas isn't much unfortunately, but I guess you come here mainly for the pizza.  You can get a bottle of wine here and enjoy it with your guests and dinner! Food was great and service was great as well.	4star
What happened??? Something has drastically changed at both the Bouluds by Lincoln Center, for the worse. Having frequented Boulud Sud since it first opened, I was very disappointed with my most recent visit two weeks ago.  Sat at the bar, which had plenty of open spaces, but for some reason it took a while to get menus and have our order taken. Ordered my usual cocktail. It arrived way too sweet. I asked for it to be adjusted, at which point the bartender brought over his squirt bottle of lemon juice and squirted some into my glass. Are you kidding? I figured a glass of wine was safer at this point. Noticed that their mushroom farrotto side had been replaced by a pesto version, so I asked about it. Bartender said oh it still has mushrooms, and some pesto added. Ordered the chicken tagine, and the farrotto on the side. The tagine, which I have had many times before, was extremely salty. The farrotto was overlooked, and no, there were no mushrooms. I had requested msemen (their delicious flatbread) when the bread was served, and was told it would come out when it was ready. It never came. All in all, a terribly disappointing meal from a past neighborhood favorite. Echoed by Bar Boulud a week later. Something has changed in that kitchen, very much for the worse.	2star
Tiny little ramen spot in the financial district. We got there exactly at 11:30am on a Friday, just missing the lunch flow. The miso pork ramen soup base was a bit too salty for my liking. The sukiyaki beef didn't have much flavor to it. I did highly enjoy the Japanese fried chicken though. It was also a bit stuffy inside, despite the warm weather. Not much seating inside so I highly recommend an early visit or a take out order. Overall, just an ok place. Don't think we'd go back.	3star
To start we ordered the spicy pork sausage and rice cakes, and pork belly steamed bun. The rice cakes were very flavorful and chewy, and crispy on the outside. It was however TOO MUCH flavor to the point of saltiness so I couldn't eat too much of it. The steamed bun plate comes with 2 pork belly steamed buns, which were pretty good. The pork belly was very soft, it just melted in my mouth. Then we had the pork shoulder and the beef brisket ssam with the total package. It included the meat, rice, lettuce, chive pancake, and two sides per dish. You wrap it all up to eat and it tastes better with the special sauce they have on the table which is slightly spicy. Both meats were soft and well marinated. All shared among 3 people and we were satisfied, not too full.	4star
I'm giving it 2 stars for ambiance and vibe. I come here often, I really like it as a bar but tonight was the first day with their new menu for fall. Two things on the menu are labeled gluten free, one of them clearly is not (it literally has Farro in the name), and one of them I had to question after they brought it out. The warm kale salad lists crispy shallots. I have eaten crispy shallots at other regular (not gluten free) establishments and they list them as gf because they're coated with rice flour. Not this one. I took a tiny bite and noticed they looked different, so I asked the waitress and she said 'pretty sure they're gf, because it says it'. Regardless, she checked with the kitchen and sure enough, they're coated with regular flour. I'd gladly come and help them with their menu since I am a chef and an expert in allergens. I really hope they change something soon before someone gets sick. Also, I have been sitting here writing this review, I ordered champagne before I even got the salad (they're making a new one now, without the shallots), and I still don't have my champagne (22 minutes).	2star
Have to give credit where credit is due.  Ugly Duckling has great food and a bunch of TVs!  I just make sure I bring cash. :)	3star
1.5 Last time - seriously.  I believe I was closer to the truth with the first review.  The bald man behind the bar would do well to find another occupation where grimacing, frowning and mumbling at paying customers is the norm - Time Warner and Walmart are always hiring.  The patio would maybe be enjoyable if the ownership applied their policy of carding people clearly in their late 20s and 30s to the slew of toddlers and infants howling and running around in circles.  Make it stop.	1star
Just went to this Ramen place for lunch and had spicy Paitan Ramen with Chicken.  Noodle was very al dente and it tasted very bland.  The broth was thick and was ok but the noodle should have blended better for my taste.   I would vote for Nishida Shoten at nearby Ramen place for the taste and the value for the buck even if I had to wait 15-20min.	2star
"Many restaurants in the Theater District attempt to lure tourists inside with average food that is almost always overpriced, but Becco is no trap. Whether you choose to dine here because of Lidia and Joe Bastianich, or because of the numerous positive reviews, a love of pasta is shared among all. And not just any old plate of pasta - a ""Sinfonia di Paste,"" in which unlimited amounts are doled out from giant bowls. Every day, three varieties of pasta are offered. Penne with short rib ragu, mushroom ravioli in a truffle cream sauce, and spaghetti al pomodoro were available during my visit. Grated Grana Padano cheese accompanies the spaghetti al pomodoro, as well as fresh basil and chunks of tomato. It has all the elements of a great pasta, and it's clear that the ingredients are high quality. To call this a basic spaghetti with tomato sauce would be a mistake. I wavered between three and four stars for this review, and while I enjoyed my meal, it didn't knock me off of my feet. Nevertheless, Becco's pasta is guaranteed to satisfy; just know that it's impossible to leave with an empty stomach!"	3star
Here's the trick to Jack's Wife Freda: show up before 10:30 am. It's that easy. There was no wait at 9:15 am, but there were their trademark crowds on the sidewalk an hour and change later. The place is cute, though the tables are packed in. Service is quick and polite. The menu is filled with things you want to eat, some healthy and some more dubious. Nothing that you haven't seen before if you've brunched in NYC-- standard plates with slightly fancy ingredients. Quinoa bowls, green shakshuka, duck bacon, salads, rose waffles, halloumi. Avocados and eggs in most dishes. Very Mediterranean; don't see a strongly Jewish influence beyond the smoked salmon. I went with Maya's grain bowl ($15), with poached eggs, avocado, quinoa, kale, and spaghetti squash. Lots and lots of spaghetti squash. I didn't enjoy it at all until I poured on the green hot sauce, which worked pretty well to cohere it. Portion was quite big. I also had the cantaloupe juice ($6) which was... interesting? I think I liked it but I was always not quite sure. It's very thick. They give it to you in a to-go cup even if you're dining in, which I initially resented but was later useful. It became better as the ice melted. Overall, it was a decent brunch, but I don't understand why you would wait hours (or even minutes) for a table here.	3star
Amazing BBQ! The place is just wonderful. Food is great and that's all that matters here. Be advised that you may have to wait a bit to get your food, there is always a line there. Definitely coming back	5star
I ended up here with my sister and brother-in-law after flying into New York from Berlin. As this was close to where they work it was an easy excuse. The wait was rather long when we arrived, but I must say it was worth it.  We ordered the tebasaki gyoza for appetizers, and I selected the Mu Ramen for my bowl. I wasn't a fan of the tebasaki gyoza. It was underwhelming, to be honest. It should have had more salt, and the dipping sauce they provided was slightly off-topic, so to speak. It tasted a little citrusy and sweet, but nevertheless I felt like it wasn't a good match for it. The tebasaki gyoza has foie gras in it, but the rather bland flavor of the breading pretty much overpowers it and it is just slightly perceivable. I would avoid ordering this next time, as it was more blah than wow. The Mu Ramen on the other hand was fantastic! The broth was great to the point that my bowl was clear of all of its contents when I was done. I decided to not add any toppings and order it as is (I didn't add egg for example) to have a better idea what the whole taste is like, and I must say that even though there aren't many fancy things going on in that bowl, it was a taste that I can recommend. So why the three stars? I am removing one star due to the underwhelming tebasaki gyoza, and another star for the price (this review would have been 4 stars if I hadn't ordered the appetizers). Where I come from I can get ramen with the same quality, for half the price. I know it's New York City, and things are expensive here, but I honestly cannot say that I am a fan when I know I can get better value at home.	3star
Love, love, love the Smith! We have been to both the Lincoln Center and Midtown locations. Both are equally excellent. The Smith is very popular and so we recommend making reservations. We love the Bloody Mary's here. They are spicy, which is what I love about them. We had an order of the doughnuts as a starter. They are served warm and are decent. My boo got the avocado toast, which he really loves. I had the mushroom omelette, which was decent. The potatoes were a bit on the salty side however. The candied bacon is always very tasty. We took a look around the dining room as other diners got their food. The brioche french toast looked excellent. The breakfast pot pie looked good too! We always enjoy coming to the Smith for brunch!! Service was very attentive. Food came out pretty quickly and hot. Our server gave us the free Bloody Mary's that came with certain entrees even though we were a little early for it (we had an 11:45 am reservation but the brunch special started at noon).	5star
This place was quite the scene, bar was hopping and it was generally packed. Not where you want to go to have a quiet conversation.  Definitely skews to the younger crowd (20's-early 30's). Food was pretty good.  Friend loved his ribeye steak.  My salmon was just okay.  Service very good.  Wines good.	4star
Actually 3 1/2 stars.  Solid food and good service.  Started with the Fried avacado, crisp and lightly battered with warm ripe avacado strips, quite tasty.  My entree was the brisket, it was little disappointing, the brisket was a little dry and could of been a little more tender, my buddy had the ribs which were cooked perfectly.  I enjoyed the cheese grits I had on the side.  Desert was the bread pudding which was just average and can be missed.  Overall I'd give them another try.	4star
Located in a basement on Mott Street. Cash Only.Down a little flight of stars. It is much bigger than it looks at firs. It also seems to have a few food items on sale on shelves.Mostly in large glass Jars I believe it is mostly Malaysian food. The coconut rice and the curry we got we quite delicious. The service is a little bit inefficient. Not bad but seems little they could get much more organized. The toast we had for the desert was great but the other desert we ordered the sticky rice pudding was unpleasant.	3star
I would give the food four stars, but the absolutely horrid service we received brings my rating down to a three. We came in on a Saturday in the afternoon, after the brunch rush had passed. We sat, we ordered, we waited, we waited some more, the empanadas came out, we ate them and waited some more, the server noticed our coffees hadn't come out, we waited, finally we got coffees. Then we waited and waited and waited. The table next to us (who arrived after us) ordered, got their food, ate, paid the bill and left. But we continued to wait for our steak benedicts. We asked a bus boy where our food was and he made a snarky comment that they were killing the cow. Note to restaurants: when a customer is rightfully upset about their food being epically delayed, do NOT make a sarcastic comment. An apology would've been nice, but we never got one from anyone, at any point! In fact our server just completely disappeared when she realized our food hadn't come out yet. I think she forgot to put in our whole order or didn't know how to put in the order, minus the empanadas. No apology. After probably an hour, we finally got our food, which looked like it had been thrown onto the plate. What would've been a nice gesture, other than an apology, would be comping something on our bill-anything! But no, we got the full fat bill. Now onto the food - the empanadas were amazing, probably the best empanadas I've had in a very, very long time. Not heavy, thick empanadas, but a light, flaky, crispy outer shell and bursting-with-flavor-ooey-gooey goodness on the inside. The coffee was good. The steak benedict I'm sure would've tasted better to me had it arrived on time, but by the time it finally arrived an hour later, I was so bitter I could barely taste it. Plus, the food was cold. The steak was a little underdone for my taste, but still delicious, my friend complained that her egg was overdone and it should've been runny, but it was closer to being hard boiled. So after waiting all this time, our waitress was no where to be seen. We had to flag down someone else to get our bill, no way was I going to wait any longer on this brunch. He got our bill, we put our cards down, then we waited some more, then we saw the guy who brought the bill motioning to our server, who finally showed, to go pick up our cards. Wow, if your co-worker has to tell you how to do your job, then you're a really pathetic waitress. No words, no apologies, just silence from our waitress. If I were her and my customers had been epically failed by the kitchen, I'd be doing everything I could to salvage the experience by being overly nice, providing excellent service, or comping something on the bill. Nope, nothing. I should've asked to speak to the manager. My bad for not being more proactive. I left utterly disappointed, annoyed and feeling like I had wasted an extra hour of my day. Absolutely terrible service.	3star
Drove all the way from Brooklyn to see what the hype was all about.  Total disappointment.  If I want good Vietnamese food go to Chinatown pho places.  $24 for fried rice and not even good.   $18 for the traditional rice dish with grill chicken and not even a crab patty.     Stay away from the vegetarian summer roll.  Such a rip-off	1star
Awful experience, the host was rude and disrespectful since I entered to the place. He asked if we had reservation even though in yelp they don't take any reservations.  Terrible attitude	1star
Went for the happy hour special. First half was great with all the beef and fried bacon. Wasn't all that impressed with the pork belly and chicken, but it was ok. Wish the staff would calm down a bit though with the japanese intro and exit shouting. I've been to other japanese restaurants that do this like Ippudo, but they don't do it quite as annoyingly. The practically scream on top of their lungs to the point that they are probably losing their voice. Other than, our waitress was friendly and the service was good. Would come back, with ear plugs.	4star
Yeah it's a nice place and all, but I didn't think it was anything special. Got the steak and toast and the Margarita flatbread pizza  along with couple of draft beers. I wasn't feeling the vibe of the place. Maybe it's more of a bar then a restaurant food was ok. Expected much better.	3star
very good place for a date or small group dinner - be ready to splurge a little because the plates can get pricey (i.e. mains are 20+) fun stuff - if you check in or reserve a table, you get to spin the wheel for free stuff. we got a free pickle jar and it was really delicious! good stuff - truffle fries and kimchi bacon pancake were very good; pancake comes with side salad and a beautiful sunny side up egg  ok stuff - braised octopus was tasty but quite expensive, beef japchae was decent but not memorable. overall: atmosphere is amazing (can get a bit loud), service people are very attentive (my water glass was always full), and food presentation was on point.	4star
Best Thai food ever had in NYC. Had a great experience last night. So good I have to write my first ever yelp review. Food is so flavorful, alive, layered, unique -- yeah it's spicy but so? That's the point. Menu doesn't compromise. I've never been to Thailand, but for the first time in NYC, after years of eating Thai food, I feel like I have. Great service too. Worth the wait!!	5star
It was tough to chose a pizza place since I wasn't going to be in New York long, we couldn't find parking so my dad dropped me off and we got the pizza to go. I wish I could've also tried the margarita pizza, but I ended up getting No. 1 on the specials. The small pizza costs about $30 after taxes, & it had 8 slices. Definitely pricey but we devoured the whole thing within minutes. I would definitely come back! The service was good & pizza came out fast.	5star
Without question, my favorite Shanghainese breakfast spot in New York. It's a bit out of the way for me (It's located in Downtown Flushing), but definitely worth a visit when you're in the area and even worth making a trip on the 7 train.  Get the soup dumplings, some scallion pancakes with or sans beef, some tripe, and you'll be a happy and full human.  You will usually have to queue for a little bit (or a long bit), but you'll be glad that you did.	5star
CAUTION: MULTIPLE FOOD POISONING INCIDENTS. I was a big fan of Blue Maiz and ate it regularly. Unfortunately, I got a terrible bout of food poisoning last week and then my co-worker got food poisoning yesterday so it was not an isolated incident. You can get food poisoning anywhere but to have two incidents at different times is troubling. Eat at your own risk.	1star
Food: 4.0/5.0 Service: 2.5/5.0 Value: 4.0/5.0 Decor: 3.0/5.0 Overall: 3.5/5.0  Count me a fan.  I wasn't sure what to expect before coming having tried some pretty good soul food down south.  I walked away very happy with the both the food and the prices, a little so less with the speed of service and potential for waits.  Two things I did notice -- no spicy option on the fried chicken so you just need to douse w/sauce yourself, and the portions on the add-on sides were really small.  If anything on the menu was really high margin, those sides would be it.  I'd still come back.	4star
Seating is a little hard here and it can get stuffy but their cuban sandwich is WORTH IT. It's quite filling and I actually shared one with a friend. Perfectly toasted bread with melted cheese...a hearty, warmness in each bite! Seems like I missed out on the corn though - come to California please!	4star
Hummmm....my wife had been after me to dine here for a year.  Either it is completely over-rated or the kitchen had a bad night.  We had a fennel salad - good...but flavors a bit unbalanced.  She had the cod...either it was frozen (a crime) or the execution was abysmal.  I had a pasta dish....both pedestrian and poorly executed.  Bottom line...maybe they had a bad night, but in NYC, there are to many other places to eat to bother going again.  Note: they only deserve one star, but I am giving them two with the assumption that they had a bad night.....	2star
My boyfriend who knows I love visiting new restaurants more than petting kittens treated me to dinner at Glasserie a couple weeks ago. The memory of our meal remains one of the best we've had in a long time. The space is really beautiful. It's sparsely decorated with plants and what appears to be lots of reclaimed wood and fixtures. I loved the feel of it. Better than the space of course was the food. Every single plate that came out of that beautiful open kitchen tasted like someone had carefully prepared each ingredient to make a special composed dish. We were moved to walk by the kitchen and thank the chefs. We had: * lamb croquettes -- These were fantastic! I actually ate a lot of homecooked kibbeh as a teen and these, with their surprise filling of peas and mint, surpassed my memories of kibbeh past. * red potatoes with egg -- beautiful, creamy magic * lamb tartar -- clean, citrusy decadence * chicken -- Wow! The chicken was perfectly cooked but the sauce and herbs and little components on this dish blew me away * labneh and flatbread -- Get this. Please.  The drinks were also lovely and so was the bartender. I have only one complaint and that is that although the server was decent he just didn't match the excellence of the rest of the experience. He was a little forgetful and sloppy but did appear to be trying hard. We were there on a night when the AC was broken so maybe he was flustered. Regardless, I'm most definitely looking forward to going back.  Welcome to the hood!	4star
"Wow! As in: Wow, this place is great!  Wow, I'm glad we got reservations! Wow, I heard the hostess tell drop-ins that the wait would be 2 1/2 hours! And for the biggest Wow! of all: Wow, their homemade pasta is spectacular. I got the spinach pappardelle with oyster mushrooms and pine nuts, and it was freaking fantastic, a clear case where getting a pasta dish in a restaurant doesn't make you think, ""Sheesh, I could have just stayed home and boiled store-bought pasta for 1/8th the price...I got yer al dente right here."" On the contrary, the spinach pappardelle at Rubirosa was the perfect temperature and texture, and its flavor was better than anything I could have ever hoped to find in a market. All the more so thanks to the brothy, earthy oyster mushroom sauce. The place bustles and pops with positive energy; it is loud, fairly densely packed and full of friendly and engaging servers. The light is low and warm, which serves two great purposes: it provides romantic ambience, and it also helps hide the puzzled look on your (my) face when you (I) realize that pappardelle is the long, wide pasta and not the kind that's shaped like little butterflies.  One other Wow! that I forgot: Wow, it's good to come here with local regulars! My girlfriend and I were here with two of her friends who are long-time patrons of Rubirosa, and as we were starting to think about asking for the bill, our server brought us a complimentary cannoli and a slice of cake. That's how you do it."	5star
There was no wait to be seated. Service was fast! Best pork soup dumplings aka (pork Xiao Long Bao) ever! We also ordered the black truffle soup dumplings (their special for the day?) which were not as flavorful and more expensive than the pork ones. I also enjoyed the Szechuan wonton! I will be back the next time I'm in town!	5star
"The smoke filled venue that's known as Hometown Bar B Que was in the area, when  my wife and I got hungry after shopping at Ikea. The line was long, however not long enough to dissuade us from wanting to sample the bar b que coming from the amazing smelling fire pits we saw, and hey they have a bar, so, why not have a drink while you wait in line? Which I did. The place was filled, my wife got a seat right near the line, which kind of made it awkward while we chowed down, since the line full of hungry patrons were right near us in the crowded dining room. Anyway, on to the review.  While the food was good, some stood out, so I am giving my top five items we tried: 1. The Korean sticky ribs When you think to yourself while on line, ""I wonder what Korean sticky ribs taste like?"" your question will be answered definitively by the taste of these ribs. Sweet, salty, soysaucey (yes, it's a word). The great combination of flavors enhanced by the roasted cashews, garlic, and scallion liberally sprinkled on top; flavor that will make you want to die and go to Korean sticky rib heaven. 2. The beef rib I need to preface this, by saying, i don't like beef ribs, but this brontosaurus sized rib was best beef i have ever tasted, it is by far, the best rib i have had, in a long time, and it was my wife's favorite, since after her first bite, she told me that I should, ""just leave the rib"" for her to eat. Alone. 3. The Wood fired chicken I don't usually find the chicken at a bar b que joint that tasty, unless it's their speciality. This chicken was really good. The pickled red onion reminded me of a mild peruvian salsa criolla that made everything taste great. The chicken was perfectly cooked and juicy, and the green salsa verde they put on top, put it over the top for me. The Last two, usually in my reviews, the last two items could have been better... 4. Spare ribs What can I say, I really need a spare rib to completely fall off the bone, for me to declare them anything but a success. These ribs did not live up to that exacting standard, however they were quite good. 5. Corn bread eh, really dense corn bread, that was sweetened by some light sugary sauce that kind of went to the bottom. While it was alright, I am a lighter fluffier cornbread type of guy, I guess. Honorable mentions? We had the potato salad and the mac and cheese. The potato salad was basically mashed potatoes with that vinegary taste, however was not to my liking. I give the sides 2 meh"	4star
"It used to be one of the best Thai restaurant in NYC but I was shocked when I recently revisited the renovated location. Now it's worse than average rating Thai restaurant. First of all, black Thai coffee is pre-made already and they can't even make a black coffee without sugar.  Stewed beef tendon soup - This was the best one out of all the dishes we ordered. Tendon was soft and good. Taste is just like pho, just without the noodle. There's no ""wow"" factor but good.  Gai-Kua (Sautée noodles with chicken, squid, and egg. - Tasteless. This was the first Thai noodle that didn't have much taste. Usually any type of noodles are really good at any Thai restaurants and I always thought that it's hard to fail noodles. So I was surprised that they did. Seasoned Pork - It had hair on it so we didn't eat it and just returned it as the waiter placed it on our table. They didn't even bother to say sorry. Roasted Duck - Duck had some duck smell that I didn't like. It says roasted duck but it's really just a duck soaking in a broth. Should have been better named maybe as a Duck soup dish rather than a roasted duck dish.  The wait staff was rude in general. They looked miserable and the service was less than mediocre.  F.Y.I this place is Cash only. Overall it was a bad experience  but the I'm giving two stars due to the larger selection of food they provide.  They might have other good dishes and better wait staff on other days  but we won't be coming back."	2star
Awesome, awesome, awesome Just one word! Food, service, ambiance everything is worth coming back.  One of the three best Thai food places I ve been to in United States.	5star
Super unimpressed. Had the pad thai chicken. Small step up from Trader Joe's in a box. Friendly staff and fast service. Waitress was hard to communicate with though.	2star
Food was good but the service was the horrible!!  The waiter was the 100% worse I have ever seen in my life!!  We will NEVER go back!!	1star
"Food was fine. The service (other than the guy busing tables, who was nice and helpful) was bad. Any place that greets you with ""And WHO are WE?"" after being ignored for ten minutes isn't the kind of place I'll be going back to. Though, I'll say this is a great place if you want to spend a lot of time in a restaurant not eating or drinking."	1star
Whatever you do...don't order a burger! They serve the same pink slime as macdonald's. And it was horrible. A previous visit when I had the Gnocchi, was the reason I returned. Not going to be fooled again...	2star
Not worth a Michelin Star.  Food - tasty. Exotic and different versus outstanding. Front staff - rude and unaccommodating  Waitstaff - rude  Witnessed either the owner or the manager come out to the front of the house and tell off a guest. While I don't know the specifics of the issue plenty of guests saw how ugly this owner/manager is. Like her staff completely unaware. Based on her behavior and how she treated a guest I will never return.  Skip this place - in Manhattan we have hundreds of restaurants more worthy of your business, and sincerely delighted to serve.	2star
Warning!!!!! Food service is extremely slow. Took about 25 min to get our food after ordering. But once we got it, it was good. But if you're starving, I'd recommend some other place.	2star
Octopus was so amazing and really fresh. Pesce Del Di' was really great too. I also recommend the Grilled vegetables. Everything was creatively done. I would love to recommend this place.	4star
Healthier than your typical American styled pizza so I can eat a lot more without feeling as full. Price is about standard, but it's very touristy so I would recommend buying a pie for take out and sit by the water, plus you don't have to tip if you take out. I think if you are from out of town, definitely try this but obviously it won't be as good as pizza from italy.	3star
An advantage of being a little older is the desire to get in and out, before the crowds arrive, especially when heading to a popular spot. A seat by a window and proper service at 5pm on a Thursday was no problem. Portions and prices are exceedingly small and obscenely expensive, as are the well made cocktails. Although everything was tasty, I'm not sure if leaving hungry after spending $350 for 2, for a 90 minute view, is justified. I believe I'll check it off my list of 'been there, done that' and move on.	3star
"My boyfriend and I were very happy to eat at a roman restaurant. I was born and raised in Bologna (Italy) and I truly miss real authentic Italian food here in the US.  We made a reservation for 10pm on a Saturday night and although it was very late (at least for us) we did not care as wanted to eat good Italian.  Couple of remarks:  1) My boyfriend wanted to order the 'Roman pasta tasting menu' and I wanted to order a la carte, however they said that was not an option. Here is the inconsistency and lack of customer service.... Not only does the tasting menu not specify a minimum for two, but also a single-person table (or at the bar) can order the tasting menu alone (we asked!).  2) We order 'Spaghetti alla Carbonara', a delicious roman pasta dish and we were extremely disappointed. The egg was overcooked (which is the biggest NO-NO for La Carbonara) and the guanciale (the key ingredient of this dish) was not existing, but they used instead bacon. 3) We also ordered the 'Whole roasted baby chicken'. It comes with a fried egg on top, so I asked if they could substitute it with some roasted potatoes and the waiter said no. She literally said ""we can serve the chicken with no egg, but we won't give you any extra food to replace it"". Even the skirt steak and the desserts were below average. Being Italian I generally care about the quality of the food more than the service, but this time I was extremely disappointed by the mediocrity of the food (not authentic Italian food) as well as the poor customer service.  It's overrated and too pricy for the actual quality of the food. If you are looking for good Italian food in Manhattan, I would definitely not go to Lupa."	2star
Red Oil Wonton is really good  I tried the shrimp dumplings, pork bun and salted egg custard bun too. But i think the red oil wonton is the star followed by the salted egg custard bun. The Pork Bun can still be improved - the bun could have been more softer. The filling in the custard bun tastes good too! but i hope they'll add a little bit more inside. I'll still be back and try their other dishes :)	4star
A group of us from work decided to all chip in $20 a man for a family style meal. $140 later we barely had anything to eat. The meatballs were undercooked, no extras were included (cheese or bread even though we asked for it), the orders of pasta ($7) had about 15 small pieces of rigatoni in the tiny bowl. The food was ok but the portions for the amount they charge is ridiculous. Just another hipster spot looking to beat you in the head for your money. Lets be realistic its chopped meat and pasta. Theres no reason 6 small buffalo meatballs should cost $6.50. Unanimous decision that this is the last time we will order from here.	2star
This restaurant has despicable service. Waits are no shorter than 2 hours. Completely not worth the wait. They tell you to wait one time but you end up waiting more and give you an attitude about you checking up on your reservation. The waiters roll their eyes every single time you ask them for anything. The place is small, dark, uncomfortable and dirty. The customer service is lacking. So not worth the wait. Go somewhere else, save yourself the time!!	1star
Okay, honestly don't know why this place has such good reviews when I can say that this was probably the worst ramen I've ever eaten. Their service was great, I'm not going to lie but everything was just off. Even their miso soup tasted like mushroom water. Definitely wouldn't come here again because the food was not good at all.	2star
As far as bars go, I have a hard time leaving this place. Fishmarket really lives up to its name by offering items like lobster, mama's seabass, fish soup, as well as crispy fried rice (so amazing i can barely type thinking about it), dumplings, fried wings and other tasty items that will make you forget you are in a bar. This level of delicious food offered at a bar is ridiculous. With drinks in hand, you can dance in the isle to the jukebox that seems to have a never ending playlist that is constantly added by the patrons. People are constantly cheering until the wee hours of the morning. I've also been here during the day, and while the crowd is lighter in amount of people, the fun is still pretty ongoing. A lot of sports fan show up to eat and watch games on the numerous TVs showing different games. Got a favorite local team? You can find your crowd here. Looking for great food, you'll find that here too.	5star
After a long day me and my family decided to have some delicious Mexican food  ,  We went to this restaurant  ( taqueria tlaxcalli ) the food is good , the staff are nice , it was one of my favorite restaurants , I been there many times and I always have a good time , but today when we order the food we specific ask for tampiqueña ( thick steak ) but when the waitress brought it to the table it was a different meat , I ask her to please change it because that was not the steak we ordered , she accepted then the owner Mauricio came to my table and he  was very rud and agressive,  he wants us to pay extra for changing the meat or he will call the police , I was literally mad , that's not the way to treat a customers .	1star
Talk about disappointment! It was our last meal before heading back to the airport and we decided to give this place a try after seeing the reviews.  It was a Sunday lunch hour so the 45 mins to an hour wait was totally understandable.  But when we finally got our meal only to find out we were paying over $15+ for a pancake we could've probably gotten at Dennys for half the price and possibly even at a higher quality, we were disappointed/dissatisfied to say the least.  If you want to pay $50+ (for two people) for a crappy brunch, this is the right place to be.  I'd rather spend $10 on a good bagel sandwich at a nearby coffee shop.  (You won't have to waste an hour waiting in the cold either)	2star
Great outdoor area, very pretty with lights. Service was extremely good for a bar and hey, clean bathrms. Best items there were the tri tips and the ribs. Fall off the bone and no sauce needed (although there was a large selection of them). All that's missing is some big screens and projectors for the game. But there are some tvs by the bar.	3star
Food is awesome. Owner promised to get a second AC next summer...for now, I recommend going on a not so hot day.	5star
This is my first time eating xiao long bao in NY. They are a little bit bigger than the ones I've had elsewhere, but they are delicious. We also dried their spicy diced pork noodle soup, stir fried veggies, and drunken shrimp (their new special). They're all very good for the price. The XLB are my favorite amongst the dishes we ordered.  Overall, the place is clean and spacious with friendly staff. It's a good place to grab a quick bite!	4star
I really enjoy their food, just really salty haha. We were able to sit there after everyone got there (party of 6) . It was a Wednesday night and super busy. We ordered but everyone got their food at different times and they bought the plates one by one rather all at once. They always made sure we had tea! Haha  The roti canai, hainanese chicken with rice are my go-to meal. I share that with friend. I feel pretty stuffed after ! The flavor is good, chicken is tender, and sauce is so good I pour it over my rice. Their ice thai tea is good but too much ice not worth. My meal came out to be 14.5$ which is not bad shared.  It's alway seems busy so expect a 20-30 min wait total to sit and get food, or longer.  Interior is chilly they keep the AC on!  It's on grand street so easy to get to dessert places afterward.	4star
Chosen purely from Yelp reviews, we had THE most fantastic dinner at Taverna Kyclades.  Without exception, every single dish was exceptional. We started with the assortment of Greek dips - each one to die for. The Greek salad was excellent - with crisp cucumber, onions,tomatoes, olives and seasoned feta. The fried calamari was crispy and tender, and our entrees were equally mouthwatering with our favorites being the stuffed clams, lobster and the pork kebabs. Although the restaurant was extremely busy, the owners took time to make sure that everyone felt like they had just welcomed you into their home.	5star
Great concept, really good food, fun space but maybe a bit overly zealous service-wise? We had way too many people swing by our 2-person table to check on us, but we understood that the restaurant location hadn't been open for too long so they're probably working out the kinks. I'm definitely coming back but may wait awhile. Serving size is pretty large, about right for the price.	4star
I have been to this spot a few times and it never changes. We have a nice mixture of after work crowd, locals passerby's, seafood fans and everything in-between. The location is huge so it can accommodate big parties and the wait time is never long. They have a nice size bar just incase you wanna come by and hang for a few instead of dinner. Staff is friendly and service moves at a good pace. Im sort of a seafood guy myself so i always order the lobster roll with the salad and fries meal. I have had tasted the burgers and even though its good, the lobster roll is consistently champion. The portions for every meal is a nice size no matter you order you'll have enough to fill you up. No complaints here with this spot. If your ever close by 19th street looking for a good burger and fries or lobster can't go wrong stopping by here	4star
The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. Food was delicious--authentic, not over priced, good portions and plenty of options for vegetarians. Service  wasn't the best but the food and ambience made up for it.  They don't take reservations on weekends so be prepared to wait for ~20 minutes.	5star
Carmines is ridiculously good! Cocktails and food are always FANTASTIC. Whenever we're in Vegas/NYC we don't miss out on the chance to come spoil ourselves at Carmines. If you've never been you HAVE to try it.	5star
We came here for an early dinner. The sake sampler was just ok. The scallop sashimi was great. We also had teriyaki chicken, katsue, and tempura. Also their signature desserts: black sesame pudding and honey flan pudding.	4star
Obsessed! Found this place on Yelp and loved everything about it when we got there.  There are plenty of tables in the back, bar in front, and great casual hip ambiance. They also didn't bat an eye when I asked for an egg on my tacos.  We got various tacos and split the fried chicken (which is gluten free). Tacos were amazing and the price points are great. Turns out they bring you a ton of chicken so bring your appetite!	5star
Traif has been a true delight, since my first time 5y ago.    Then indulgence of the Chef's tasting menu, surprisingly well priced.    Giant Santa Barbara prawns, strawberry ribs  Sections of wonderful desserts    Been sick for a few years,  better now- dreaming of my return.    Birthday is coming up??? :) Love the  story behind the name.  So sweet.	5star
"I came here the other day for my best friend's birthday dinner. She made reservations on (what I consider) one of the coldest nights of the year, at 16 degrees. When we arrived at the restaurant with an ice cream cake, we were told then for the first time that there was a ""cake cutting fee"" (verbatim). We agreed with discontent because it was practically the only restaurant in the area and it was freezing cold outside to go anywhere else. Please note that as we made the reservations and we were never told that there was going to be any cake fees for the birthday dinner. To add onto our experience, we were seated right by the door where the draft blew towards us and cooled our food so quickly that the pasta sauce solidified before we could finish our dish.  In addition to our displeasure, they did not even help us cut our ice cream cake for us. We were even given an ordinary table knife to cut our ice cream cake... At least they sang happy birthday to my best friend?  I guess to be fair, they did seat us down before our regular reservation time without a question or wait. Also, the food is decent for the price and neighborhood. The pasta was delicious and tasted like the fresh kind. I would recommend the pizza though because they offer delicious combinations of toppings."	2star
Very good tavern. It smelled a little weird when we got there but the drinks were great for brunch and actually better than the drink that I had the night before at the Campbell apt. The food was also really good as we'll as the coffee. You can really tell if a place was good if the coffee is good and this place has good coffee.  I'd go back.	4star
I would have given your location 4 stars if the bartender would have not gotten upset over the fact that I pointed out my glass was dirty. I'm sorry but I refuse to drink from a dirty glass. As for the food the chef is a master indeed, the California egg benedict was made to perfection this includes the the home fries.  We also had the eggs benedict over a biscuit with gravy.....which was delicious.  As for the decor it's very hip and calls you in. The brunch is a little over priced, but the food is worth the price. Thanks again chef! On a positive note the bartender did change her attitude at the end, but the 1st impression is the last impression.	3star
My favorite thing on the menu at Amy Ruth's is The Afrika Bambatta, which comes with fried whiting and two sides. Although I've tried almost every side item, my two favorites are the potato salad and collard greens. I took a buddy who ordered The Ruby Dee, which is the catfish plate, and paired it with the steamed okra and homemade mac & cheese.  The helpings here are plentiful and the food is delicious! One of my favs in NYC!	5star
I love this place but recently had a bad experience.  I was in the area so I picked up some tacos for lunch to bring back to the office (in Flatiron). I get back to work and open the box to see that one it's a huge mess and two there's guac all over. I have an avocado allergy and specifically asked that no avocado of any kind, guac included, be put on my tacos. The guy who took my order told the guys prepping the food about my allergy. So, I'm unsure where that message got lost in translation.  There was no way I was going all the back down there to get another taco. It was a waste of time and money.  Here's a tip: Take food allergies seriously. If I were to eat the food and have a severe allergic reaction... that's on the establishment.	2star
DON't T ORDER FROM HERE. They messed up our order, and when we called to ask them to fix it, they were rude and basically told us we had messed up, not them. Had to call three separate times and an hour later they STILL hadn't brought the correct order. Worst customer service ever.	1star
Babbo is probably in my top five favorite restaurant in Manhattan, and I don't say that lightly given the amount of good restaurants there are in New York City.  I have been to Babbo three times, and every time the food does not disappoint. We went here for Valentine's day dinner, and it was just as impeccable as all the other times we came to Babbo.  Service - spot on. From the moment you walk in the door, they make you feel special.  Food - we got the grilled octopus and mozzarella to start, two lobster spaghettinis, and shared the pork chop main. The grilled octopus is cooked to perfection, with the perfect amount of sauce drizzled on top. Mozzarella is not the best I have ever tasted, but the pesto complements it well. The lobster spaghettini is the dish that steals the show every time - there is no tomato sauce better than a Batali tomato sauce. The pork chop was massive - perfectly moist and went well with the balsamic. The banana crostata at the end could have had a bit more texture, but overall good.	5star
"The hype MUST be in the deserts which I didn't get because the food was blah at best. The service was fine, a little lazy with absolutely no energy just going through the motions and the food, which is why we come to spend a ridiculous amount of mo way in Times Square was just okay. I kept it super simple with a grilled cheese sandwich and fries. The bread was so thick is swallowed the little bit of cheese and the bread was hardly it at all buttered. But I can't express how unnecessary it was for the bread to be so thick. It felt like ""he we have this bread already no need to get different bread."" For $13 I didn't need it to be superior grilled cheese but I would have rather found an IHOP. So there you go, if you're not getting desert eat anywhere else but here."	1star
The best pizza ever!!! We went for lunch after a bit of walking in the city. The food and service was great. I definitely recommend getting the meatballs (and dipping bread in the leftover meat sauce, sooo good!!!). Recommend getting the large pizza if you are with more than 3 people. Come here and you will not be disappointed.	5star
Great food, Great and fast service! Great deco and atmosphere! Great Thai experience!	5star
Fantastic pizza and Italian options at Rubirosa!!! Quality food and romantic old school cozy atmosphere. Definite must try for anyone and especially the other pizza traps in the area!	5star
"I believe this place is new. I didn't notice how new it is... anyway here's my review. Food: I like their marinated prime beef Drink: they have full bar, order anything you like Service: was good, quick and polite Price: okay I guess since there's no other Korean BBQ in that area My main concern is their cleanliness. Consider this place is ""new"", they need to pay attention to their restroom. The restroom floor was way too sticky, my sneakers were struggling walking from the door to the stall. It's like walking on top of mouse trap. Not even joking. I mean, how do you mop the floor? If being new already like this, I wonder how clean it is later on. Places where customer can see is already dirty, imagine the place where we as customer can't go and see... like their kitchen for example. Hmm!?!?!?"	3star
This place has good pizza and I say good to emphasize the fact that it is not fantastic. But, you would think it is fantastic due to the price... It is way too expensive for what you get. They do not allow take out. Which forces the customers to dine in and pay $20 on avg. tax/tip for a small thin crusted oven baked pie that is a dime a dozen in this town. Each pie should be $12 max, unless they put something fancy on it, like Fair trade vegan figs or some BS topping you would only find in a hipster pizza den in Greenpoint. In summary they have good pizza that is waaaayyyyy overpriced. Cool vibe and nice staff were a reason for the added 2nd star!	1star
So dope. Perfect mix of local down to earth vibe with sophisticated flavor. The local bar fly as well as the bougie hipster can call this amazing place home. Rarely give 5 stars but they deserve it!	5star
"ATMOSPHERE:  Come here for the beautiful decor! The lighting in this restaurant is insane and every Instagram-lover should come get some shots of it! FOOD ORDERED: - Curry Puffs - great classic curry puffs with a lovely sweet/clear dipping! - Gai Hor Bai Tong (Chicken-pandan leaves) - this dish was a bit underwhelming. You'd think that having to unwrap the meat from the leaves would mean the meat would be spectacular. It was decent, but not worth the excitement - though the sauce was good.  - Kao Tang Na Tung (Crab-coconut dipping) - GET THIS! It looks very subpar when served (the rice cakes make it look ""eh"") but when you actually eat it, trust me, you'll love it! - Panang Curry - Pretty good, but a bit too spicy for my taste ~ although, my boyfriend who loves spicy food really just loved the dish! COMMENTS: We were given two complimentary ""coconut curry soups"" in shot glasses upon arrival which was a welcoming gesture. Our servers were all incredibly kind, and helpful with deciding what to eat! One complaint: the tables on the side wall are all quite close together, so getting in & out of the inside seat required a lot of careful moving."	4star
Who would've thought quality tacos could be found in the trendy tourist trap that is Chelsea Market? Food is really good, but the wait sucks thanks to it being such a tourist hotspot. Also there's really no dedicated spot to eat, so good luck finding an open community table. That said, if you're in the area and craving tacos and can afford to wait, definitely give this place a shot! Keep it simple and just order a plate of one taco each (steak, chicken, pork and cactus) - you can't go wrong with this variety, plus the cooks here are on point and load up each taco so that the meat + filling is piled high. Guac is nice and chunky and I love all the Mexican soda flavors.	4star
Went here for brunch on a Saturday. Got a seat right away which was really nice. Good menu with a variety of choices. Note they only have whole milk when ordering lattes which deterred me from ordering one but my brother got a mocha latte and enjoyed it. The spinach and goat cheese omelette was pretty good. The piece of toast and the home fries it came with were delicious. My brother said that his dish, the smoked salmon crostino, was spicy and ok. Not sure he would get it again but he agreed that the bread and home fries were great and he would come again to try something new.	3star
Came here one night and ordered the fish tacos. Didn't expect the fish to be completely raw and cold. Didn't eat them but the server still charged me.	2star
I am pretty shocked by my treatment today at Mekelburg's. There were three people behind the register, two of whom were doing nothing (well, chatting and dancing). I asked if they had another of one of the frozen items I was purchasing so I could buy two, and one of the people doing nothing said, it'd be down there with the frozen food (where I found it? no kidding?). I am pregnant and said I couldn't really see down there very well and was hoping someone would help me. The person shrugged and went back to dancing. I shop here pretty regularly, but I won't be back. The service is usually mediocre to poor in the grocery section, but this was flat out obnoxious.	1star
About 3 years ago, I was in Redhook for an oyster festival at Brooklyn Crab when my friend & I couldn't resist the aroma coming from Hometown Bar-B-Que. Despite our full belly's we walked into Hometown & ordered the brisket, lamb belly, beef ribs & sides that I cannot recall. We thought everything was amazing & I'd been dreaming of the moist, flavorful meats. Since I do not have a license nor do I live in Brooklyn making a trek to Redhook is a bit tough & also needs to be a special occasion. A friend of mine was visiting from DC & we decided to make the trek.  When we got there the line was already out the door but fortunately you can have a drink while you wait. It definitely makes the time go quicker. Once it was our turn to order we went to town, we ordered a 1/2 pound of brisket, lamb belly, korean sticky ribs & chicken with mac & cheese, coleslaw and beans with burnt ends. We grabbed two seats at the bar and I quickly took a bite of brisket only to be let down. It was lukewarm and somewhat dry. Not to let the bite of the brisket spoil everything I took a bite of the lamb belly & that was cold. Yummy but cold. My friend had the Korean sticky ribs and thought those were ok (I don't eat pork) and the chicken was actually the best part of the meal. It was juicy, flavorful and pipping hot. It was marinated with a chimichurri-esque sauce & had some pickle onions on it.  I wound up taking a lot of this home & repurposing into different things. The lamb went into a ragu w/carrots, onions & orecchiette, the brisket into a salad/rice dish. I'm not sure if I'll head out here again since it's such a trek, unless someone is driving here I'm not going out of the way again.  TLDR Pros  Live music  Woodfired Chicken Coleslaw The Meh Brisket - lukewarm & dry Lamb Belly - Super cold, wound up taking this home & making a ragu w/it Cons  How disappointed I felt that the experience didn't repeat.	3star
Their tuna mayo appetizer is TO DIE FOR. We order that and the truffle fries every. Single. Time. Great atmosphere, good service, and great food. This is my favorite restaurant go-to!	5star
I'm visiting from out of state and decided to try this place out since there were so many reviews on yelp. Surprisingly, there wasn't a long wait at all for our group of 7, perhaps it was luck! We ordered the Akamaru Ramen and the pork ippudo buns.  The pork in the buns are flavorful and tender. The ramen on the other hand was not really above average for me. Overall, very good but not something I will crave!	3star
I just ordered a delivery of Broiled salmon and white rice. I am so disappointed I was charged $27 for this. It was such a small portion so not worth what o was charged. I definitely will not be ordering from here again.   What a rip off.	1star
Yum! I use to work in Dumbo and would always walk past the restaurant. I finally decided to stop in and was not disappointed. Food was delicious. I would recommend and go back if I'm ever in the area	5star
Overpriced Went there with my girlfriend today since my friend Soup dumplings were okay but it was just okay Other dumplings were terrible Braised beef noodle was under seasoned And jing jiang rou si had some kind of weird smell Servers never came to table to help us out Only came to our table if we were gonna pay or order more drinks I felt pretty sorry for my girlfriend about i took her to that place We basically paid around 70 dollars for shitty foods and forced to pay amounts of tip money	2star
I had a nice dinner here last night with my mom. Here's a rundown of the experience: - Service: our server was very nice and informative. She checked on us often enough and gave good recommendations. - Atmosphere: casual chic. It's a big, loud restaurant with tables close together. - Drinks: we each had a cocktail and a glass of wine. I had a grapefruit mezcal cocktail and my mom had a ginger margarita (both $16). The ginger margarita was the better of the two but I enjoyed both. We both got a glass of Chardonnay after which was good but pricey ($18). The wine list in general was pretty pricey by the glass.  -Food: we had the beet and yogurt salad to start along with the crab toast. We both then had the roast hake. The crab toast was my favorite of all - it had big chunks of crab and had a nice spice. The beet salad was good as well but small. I enjoyed the hake as well but it was a little too spicy (it didn't appear spicy on the menu). -Price: about what you would expect in Manhattan. Would be nice if they had some less expensive wine options. Overall we had a good experience and will be back!	4star
Tried the Arrachera Tacos and the Chorizo Tacos. First of all, just want to say that these tacos are truly Loaded with the meats! The early reviews seemed to indicate they were a bit stingy when they first opened, but it looks like they listened and made a change. I could barely pick up the taco without meat scattering all over the place; usually a good indicator! At the least, the pile of meat somewhat justifies the price. Sadly that's the end of my praise. These tacos are just really really basic. It's a large pile of meat in a shell.  The meat is well seasoned, well cooked and overall the tacos taste decent, but It's just nothing to go out of your way for. A bit more onions and cilantro, etc. Would go a long way to helping balance the flavor and texture a bit and adding some complexity. The sauce that came on the side with the tacos was pretty bad. A good sauce would have also helped with balancing things out.	2star
Excellence in everything! Customer service, food, drinks, atmosphere. The wings are absolutely melt in your mouth fantastic. Mac and cheese....no words. I almost cried how delicious it was. Steak with the garlic butter cooked and taste to perfection. My new favorite spot!	5star
the restaurant should be much cleaner - don't feel comfortable here and cash only	1star
I went to have brunch this past Sunday (table of 4)  I even went as far as making a reservation to make sure things would go smoothly. Unfortunately, the experience was anything but pleasant. For starters, they made us wait for 2 hours , the whole process seemed unorganized, to say the least. We sat at the bar to wait while they sorted us out..  However,they never checked on us and on top of everything else the bartender was the worst part of this experience..she lacked patience and class. She was just blatantly rude. We were very disappointed.	1star
.Nothing to write home about.  Mystery menu and mystery bill.  They give you a bill at the end with a price on a piece of paper no breakdown.  So assume everything is about 20$ a pc.  Cash only even though it doesn't say so on the door or anywhere else.  It was a disappointment for Italian food.  Arthur avenue isn't like it used to be.	2star
I had dinner here on a Monday night and it was relatively packed. An hour before arrival, we made a reservation for a party of four and were seated within 15 minutes of getting there.  It was a birthday celebration and the wait staff were very accommodating and patient with our delayed ordering.  There was a lot of mixing and sharing at the table. I had the Pastor Taqueria as an appetizer. It was really tasty and filling. However, I had a very bites of the Tostadas de jaiba (crab in crispy tortilla) and it was amazing.  As my main, I had the De Pollo en Salsa Verde enchiladas. It was delicious but it wasn't my favorite. My boyfriend had Cochinito Chiapaneco (Roasted Pork Ribs). I have a few bites and it was really flavorful and well seasoned.  We were a bit restricted because one in our party had a seafood allergy. About half of the menu is seafood and it looked delicious. So I would definitely have to make a second visit to try the seafood options.   However, the main attraction were the cocktails. They were soo good. The Caipirinha and Margaritas were definitely worth it. This is definitely the best Latin American cuisine that I have had in a while. It definitely lives up to its Michelin Star.	4star
Brunch at Jane is much like the beginning of Indiana Jones and Raiders of the Lost Ark. You voyage through the jungle of Soho to get to this dim-lit oasis, in pursuit of the most desirable of treasures--Eggs Benedict. Battle through the hoards of patrons without reservations sitting outside (Tourists. Why'd it have to be tourists?) when your party finally gets to your seat, you gleam at the wondrous menu to find exactly what you been searching for--brunch options and complimentary cocktails. Once you've made your order, the real struggle begins. The harrowing obstacles arise--the outrageously long wait for your food, the waves of patrons squeezing past your chairs, the stray thought you have about why the $13 Pastry Basket is so small. You feast and then emerge from the cave-like restaurant with your prize--a full stomach. Then you go teach a history class. In all seriousness, I find the brunch here overrated--narrowingly made better by the complimentary cocktails (you only get one...I've asked). My goat cheese & spinach omelette wasn't good--the egg developed a waxy texture, like when it's over cooked and sitting out for a while. And seriously--why is the $13 pastry basket so small?! This disappointed me because the lunch menu here is quite good--the burger is solid, and so are a lot of the lunch choices here. Not worth it to go out of your way. I'd rather just watch Indiana Jones again.	3star
No, sorry. The quality of the drinks and food is just not there. Next time I'll try the food court next door.	2star
I don't think I have ever given a bad review on Yelp, but I feel compelled to say something.  Maybe I am spoiled by the BBQ places in the Wild West of NY, but I have had much better meals at Desperados, Smoke on the Water, and Dinosaur BBQ around the Buffalo area. After recommendations from friends while we were visiting NYC, we decided to have a night of delicious BBQ.  First off, there's the line. The night we went was a Wednesday night with only maybe 5 parties in front of us, yet it took forever. It became apparent that the register was the bottleneck, as they were halting the line to process internet order payments. So you wait while your food sits on your tray and gets cold.  My wife and I ordered: Half a pound of brisket and a half a pound of pulled pork, both were really dry, and no amount of their sweet BBQ sauce that tasted so much like ketchup that I thought it was ketchup, or their other sauce that was way over the top smokey could fix. I'm used to brisket so tender that it can be cut with the edge of your fork and melts in your mouth. This was dry, burnt, cold, meat.  We also got the baked beans that also had that weird smokey sauce that made them taste funky after a few bites.  And we also got the broccoli salad, which is great if you are looking for large pieces of uncooked broccoli that have been tossed in what appears to a slightly spicy Italian dressing. The price was pretty high too. I wouldn't have had a problem with the high prices if the food knocked my socks off, but I would have been disappointed with this stuff if it was free at a catered event. Again I feel horrible about writing a bad review, but I'd hate to see someone who has had good BBQ pay a lot of money for something so poor. Some of the locals really seem to enjoy this place and the people working there were pleasant, and they a some decent beer on tap. But don't come here expecting the best BBQ you have ever had.	1star
We happened to walk by this restaurant on a quiet Sunday evening. Lukily, we were were seated right away. The decor is charming and cosy, our waiter was very attentive and polite, and most importantly the food was absolutely delicious! Definitely worth visiting!	5star
I give five stars to the best fries I have ever had; cheap price; different types of sandwiches; good bubble tea; and good customer services!	5star
The vibes here are so perfect! The staff are all so friendly and accommodating. We were warmly welcomed at the door of the packed restaurant by the hostess. She was sure to be attentive to everyone on the list waiting for a table.  When we sat down to order our server was so laid back. She happily switched my bf's order when it wasn't what he expected. Don't be alarmed, the food is great! Just wasn't what he has in the mood for.  I have to say the food is amazing, but more Mexican inspired than Cuban. Either way, it was all delicious! I had the best jalapeño margarita of my entire life here!! It had such a natural and robust spicy flavor!  Must have for a nice afternoon bite!	5star
I've never seen a place with this many reviews and an actual 5 star rating. It boggles my mind.  However, when I got here I finally understood. Everything was fairly priced, the decor was woodsy and cute, the service was incredibly friendly l, and the food was just divine. We got truffle herbed fries, steak chimmichuri lollipops, and a Cuban with a side salad. Truffle fries? Yes! Those are my favorite kinds of fries, especially with a chipotle mayo. Steak kebabs? Yum! Pork Cuban had such juicy meat paired with an aioli to make it even more moist.  Although I don't live in the neighborhood, I'd go back to the restaurant on days where I visit!	5star
We came here hungry and left very satisfied. The ratings that led us here were spot on, so let me return the favor. Great food and great service.  The Suspender burger was outstanding. Fries were perfect. My wife loved the chicken pot pie. My son devoured the grilled cheese. My sister got the quesadilla... which she said was excellent.  Everything we ate exceeded our expectations.	5star
Came into Thai villa and it was the most beautiful restaurant.  The decor is so nice and you feel great being there.  We got a complimentary appetizer which was some type of watermelon concoction.  Whatever it was it was good.  Next we got two appetizers to split... 1) spicy wings - this was the best item we ate all night. Amazing.  Should of ordered 4 orders lol   2) steamed dumplings - this was good but not as good as the wings.... not amazing but good Entrees: Pad see ew with beef and pad Thai (the regular kind not royal) with crispy duck.  But we're very good dishes nothing bad to say except maybe add a bit more sauce to both dishes.  We will be back!	4star
Had heard really good things from some native Harlem cats but was a bit disappointed. On the good side the chicken and waffles were as good as I've had anywhere with the waffles being some of the best. The greens were perfect also.  The service was polite but almost non existent. Our drinks arrived after 30min and we had already finished our appetizers...and it was sweet tea. How does that happen? The apps were ok and the spring roll was interesting and fun but didn't blow my mind. Mac and cheese was dry and yams a little on the sweet side. The peach cobbler was literally a cup of crust. Which was good but just not a whole cup full. I had to ask for some peaches to be added.  Would I go again? For the chicken and waffles, yes and maybe the catfish. If I was looking at a hour plus wait I would probably go head somewhere else.  BTW - the owner was there and she was very nice and sweet.	3star
Firstly i'd like to say i love the ambience of this place, its built like a yacht, it has a very nice decor and being a huge lover of music, i have to say thumbs up to them for their selection of music..  Now to the food, we came here during restaurant week, for starters we had the crispy shrimp tempura and lobster bisque soup-- YUM YUM.. ORGASMIC, all of the above.  For entrees my boyfriend had the miso glazed salmon, i on the hand, had the nori crusted tuna which was on the restaurant week menu.. both dishes were average and could have been better, seeing as we had high expectations based on how amazing the starters were, I have to say we were disappointed.  My boyfriend had the saki sparkling which was amazing, he couldn't stop raving about it. i will attach photos.. would i come back? i cant really tell, maybe i will just for the starters and the music of course.	3star
Pastrami sandwich needs work, mostly gristle. Server was odiferous, but very nice. Matzo ball soup was good though.	3star
Food was really bland and portions small. I ordered some wings and they literally just sprinkled 3 drops of BBQ sauces and called it honey BBQ wings. Scallion pancakes were like small pieces  of chips, the beef stew noodle soup was just 3 pieces of beef with some water... maybe tasted a hint of msg...they get one star for fast delivery and another star for the shredded beef hand pulled fried noodles which was the only dish that hinted some flavor.	2star
A variety of happy hour options until 10pm. Sangria was not the best and other drinks were OK for around $6. Plenty of space on a weekday. Probably different from the weekend busy vibe, but I liked the chill atmosphere. Super nice servers! A manager-like person was also checking in on people, the fan, the candles, and it felt well-maintained.  We got the Satay chicken with coconut rice and Five spice Calamari. Both decent prices and plenty for two, but the sauces were too sweet for my taste.  A good place for cheap drinks and food in the LES.	3star
"I bookmarked this place to try during my NYC trip cos I love Poke. Came around 9 am and the workers there were so curt and seemed uninterested in helping customers. I was given the finger and ""hold on"" by one person, and after choosing out my poke on the laminated sheet, I was told ""Oh, we only serve breakfast now!"" and was given the breakfast sheet instead. Ok, why were the regular Poke sheet out when you are not serving it anw? What a waste of time. I don't enjoy writing a 1-star review but I am compelled to cos this visit just annoyed me sooooo much. This kind of service should not exist for a place like this. From the website to the decor and the meticulously designed menu, I can see that SOMEBODY cared A LOT about this restaurant, for uninterested and moody people at the front to give a bad impression, it's unnecessary."	1star
The brisket is good, as are the pork links. When I went, the pulled pork was dry and flavorless. The sauces  weren't great and lack variety, but you don't need hem for the brisket. The sides come in servings better suited for four people and are priced accordingly. They seemed setup more for catering  and  takeaway--they need a basic lunch platter at a decent price.  But, although this is good brisket, the prices are just too high. I spent $34 for three quarter pounds of meats, two sides, and a soda.	4star
I came here with two other friends on a Friday night. The place was relatively empty for a Friday night. I tried ordering the meat candy, but we were pretty disappointed that they ran out. We ended up getting pork belly, Mac and cheese, lemon cake, and a couple of drinks. They will all right, but nothing to write home about. Service was pretty slow.	3star
Seriously nothing special here. I'm not sure why this place was so busy and packed for our Saturday afternoon brunch. The service is quite friendly, and the tables are far enough apart so that you're not sitting on top of other people, but that's where it ends. We had the hamburger and the pop-over (also ordered the small pastry basket but it never came). The food was decent- nothing special. The two cocktails we ordered were too sweet. We were considering dessert but we waited a full 10 minutes between the time they took away our plates and the time they came back to clean the table. By then we weren't interested. Can't think of a single reason why we'd ever come back here.	3star
The menu seems a bit overpriced for grilled foods and beer, but you can't beat the view.  Not much here for vegetarians except a veggie burger, corn and salad but lots of grilled meat items.  The food was a-ok and since I don't have a grill, I will be back.	3star
"The execution of the dishes I tried were unimpressive. The gnocchi had an overly rich, too-simple sauce and was soft from over-cooking.  The squid ink linguine was soggy in texture and the sauce, while tasty, was missing a touch of ""something"" special to elevate it above something I'd buy in a jar at Whole Foods. Also, the prawns in the linguine seemed more like an after-thought than a deliberate choice; their delicate flavor was couldn't stand up against the spiciness of the tomato sauce. The one saving grace was the charred octopus-- flavorful, well-cooked, and well-paired with a beautiful tapenade that didn't overwhelm the seafood but which I'd happily spread on bread. The amarcord cocktail was uninspiring and tasted like a simple gimlet. The service was excellent; our waitress was lovely and I watched the host chase after a party after they'd left their doggy bag at the table. If not for the service, I would give Da Claudio two stars."	3star
We've been meaning to try out this place for a long time, then we were meaning to write a review for this place for a long time, both were delayed and pushed back, for a long time.  But, here it is! This place has been on our radar for a while, but due to its location away from the city and far from public transportation, it's a little bit harder to get to.  Also, we almost never go to this part of Queens.  But when we did go on a Saturday, we realized how easy it would've been to come here, and easy street parking. We got to ordering the onion rings and Connecticut lobster roll with fries instead of chips.  The roll comes loaded with lobster, as expected, along with fries and some slaw.  First impression was delicious lobster, great!  Then a few minutes later, as the lobster high goes away, we realized the flavor wasn't much.  The sandwich was basically lobster and bread, the butter didn't really appeal to us and the bread seemed plain.  Next time, we'll try another sandwich and see how that goes.	3star
Quality!  The spicy XLB were particular good, as were the cold sesame noodles. The soy garlic noodles were a bit bland for my pallet, but my kids loved them.  Worth a subway ride for quick reasonably priced casual eats.	5star
Discovered this gem last year through a friend. I decided to return with a guy friend of mine. He's never heard of the place so I decided why not have him come with me. This place tends to get packed easily. So come prepared to wait on a line. Line 1 is for food & drinks. Line 2 is for corn & drinks.  Their Margaritas & Moritas (Margarita & Mojito) are really good! You can tell that they added more alcohol to the pre-mixed frozen drink. I had a Guava Morita & a Mango Margarita. The thing that I love most about it is the fresh puréed fruit. Yum yummies!  The food is mediocre. I had a Pork Plato, their infamous corn & fries. The Pork Plato came with Pernil (pork), yellow rice & beans. I could've done without the beans. There was a hint of something that might be really tasty but I just couldn't find it. The corn was delicious! The perfect amount of seasoning, cheese and buttery goodness. I wish Habana offered a Shrimp Plato :/ This is a cool kickback spot if you want to get a nice buzz from the drinks and a light meal to eat.	4star
Roberta's is located on a side street (on Moore Street, via Bogart Street) in the East Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, NY.  If you are lucky enough to order the Axl Rosenberg Pie (sopressata, jalepeños, mushrooms & garlic),  you will be in pizza heaven.	5star
We came in on a rainy day, our car broke down, we were stranded on Park Ave, and starving, and yelp said this place looked good, and so we checked it out. My first reaction was that this place was a tourist trap, plain and simple.  That altogether lowered my expectations for this place. However, I was pleasantly surprised. We ordered a group of appetizers, the mini French dip sliders, the pepperoni flatbread, and the macaroni and cheese, and they all exceeded expectations, and they were all very delicious!  The macaroni and cheese stole my heart specifically, definitely one of the best I have ever had. The appetizers were a huge success, but I really didn't think that it would flow into the entrees, however, I was wrong!  The 16 Oz ribeye steak, paired with a mushroom and fingerling potato hash, was huge, but was also perfectly cooked to medium rare and extremely flavorful.  It matched any well known steakhouse steak (I'm looking at you Peter Luger!).  My brother got the burger, in which he finished without uttering a word.  He said it was the best burger he ever had. After feeling ecstatic, and a bit relieved with how the beginning portions of the meal turned out, we decided to splurge on dessert, and we got the chocolate chip cookie skillet.  That was honestly the best I've ever had.  Perfect amount of chocolate and the cookie was not doughy.   It was extremely rich with a cold, refreshing and tasty vanilla ice cream, truly a great finish to any meal and a great picker upper for the events that happened before. I will say that I wish the service was a bit better.  There were periods of time in which our server would be no where in sight, and we had to repeatedly ask other waiters for water or for refills on our iced teas.  Overall, I was pleasantly surprised, and Park Avenue Tavern went from a place we went to out of desperation to a place we would gladly return to out of enjoyment.	4star
We went as a group of five 10 days after the opening. The service was fine but the food was pretty terrible. We had the following: Eggs escoche - the crust on the outside was dry and that is all I pretty much can remember from this dish Ceviche - tasted of only ginger. Any taste of the fish was completely masked by the overwhelmingly presence of the ginger Steak - poorly cooked. Tough. Grisly. It was simply a bad piece of meat. And for $26 it was completely overpriced.  Arepas - it wasn't even an arepa. It was a miniature tostada.  Lamb sliders - the meat tasted like it had been cooked hours before and then only slightly warmed up. They came out cold and gross. The russian dressing on the side added no life to the sliders.  Margaritas  - not consistent. One of them was in characteristically spicy.  I think a total overhaul of the menu and this place could actually be ok. Even the general greene is better.	1star
Are they good? Oh yeah, they're good. Did it live up to the hype? Eh... With only four types of tacos on the menu (Carne Asada, Pollo Asada, Nopal, and Adobada), Los Tacos definitely specializes in what they do best. Sure, there are some other options on the menu, like quesadillas, chips & salsa, and some plates, but the tacos are a must-have. You order at a register, and are presented with a ticket which you then give to one of the chefs on the line. They may or may not ask you about your preferences - I was asked if I wanted everything on the tacos, to which I replied yes, but I wasn't asked whether I wanted corn or flour, which I didn't even know was an option until the next person in line was asked (the default is corn, by the way).  The tacos come with all sorts of goodies on top, and the meat was some of the most tender and flavorful I've ever had. The Adobada absolutely melted in my mouth. The salsa bar presents three options, ranging from a very mild pico to a pretty hot red salsa, and there are plenty of fresh limes for the taking. A fourth type of salsa came with the chips that I ordered, which I thought was delicious and packed a pretty solid kick.  Tacos will run you about $3.50-$3.75 a piece, and chips were another $3.50 I believe, which I thought was overpriced for the small bag I got. Three tacos will fill you up if you're hungry, two if you're not.  Don't get me wrong, the tacos were REALLY good (4.5 stars). Unfortunately I just came with obscenely high expectations. The main curse for Los Tacos is that its location in Chelsea market is just terrible. There's absolutely no seating and eating your tacos on a cramped bench in the middle of the market really kills the whole experience.  Los Tacos is definitely the best joint in Chelsea market, and I'd absolutely come back if I found myself there again, just not sure if I'd rush to go out of my way.  Note: Does not take Amex. $5 card minimum.	4star
I used to love this place. It was the first place me and my boy friend dated at. We returned servers time to the place.  This time, the good quality has totally changed. We guess they changed the chef or owner. Food no longer fresh, plates were dirty, and pasta was like frozen food that throws on the plates.  Everyone's portion on plates was different . We will not come back anymore	1star
I came to this spot after receiving a recommendation from a friend about how amazing this place was.  It was no disappointment.  The cocktails are fantastic and they have excellent wings among other items on their menu.  The decor is that of the black and white era and they have movies from that period playing at the bar area for style.   This is a great to may up with friends or even take someone for a date.	5star
meh.. stopped here for lunch after an IKEA run and found that the lunch menu is short and the prices are ridiculously expensive for the offerings.. the sandwich was full of bread that was soggy and tasted like it was frozen with little cold cold meat in between while the pressed sandwich was lacking any substance between the buns to press against.. note, if you want to feel cool and drink like a fish mid-afternoon and discuss the troubles of the world in true hipster alcoholic fashion, then this place gets 4 stars but for lunch it's a disappointment..	2star
A restaurant in LA needs to learn how to make a burger like this venue here. Not even joking. I'm so happy my friend told me about this spot as I visited new york because I LOVE BURGERS. It's been a couple weeks since I had it, but man i still dream about this burger and want to experience the flavors of it again. Like how can you hate on a burger so simple, yet delivers flavors beyond ones imagination. Of course I'm over exaggerating, just a bit. But got damn, I want to eat this burger again ! Please to-go me one to LA lol. Anyhow, burger is about 30 bucks. I say it's worth every bite. Seriously, if you're thinking about what to eat and you're reading this. Don't hesitate and get your ass moving to this location and grab a burger. You could thank me later. Would I come back? I am back at heart  and i will eat here when I come back in the future.	5star
Had drinks at the bar and had a great time. Decent beer selection and the bartender was great. There is an upstairs and downstairs bars so I imagine it can cater to large crowds which is always a plus when you aren't in the mood to wait for a drink.  All the food whizzing by me looked good too. No complaints here!	3star
Pros: Amazing pizza Fast service Simple menu Cons: Need a better waiting system  Wait is ridiculous!!  It's 2017- take a number, send a text when the table is ready  I'm all about good food, so naturally when I come to any city, I hop on yelp to see what my fellow yelpers recommend. Given that this place had such a high rating and we were craving pizza, I had to check it out!! First attempt was on a Saturday evening at 6pm; the wait was almost 2hrs and people were standing in line for the food. No thanks. I will never wait that long for food, don't care how good it is. Second attempt was a late Sunday brunch around 2pm. The wait was an hour which wasn't as bad as before, so we went for it. We were seated about 30 mins after waiting. Not too shabby!  The food was DELICIOUS ITALIAN, PERFECTION. We ordered the meatballs and Caesar salad, which was plenty to split between 3 people. The meatballs were flavorful and authentic. Juicy and saucy. The salad was not over dressed. And the pizza- man oh man- was it Goooooodd. We ordered the no. 4 and had it doused in truffle oil (after figuring out we could do half and half but it was too late, this was the compromise). It was outstanding!! The service was quick and the food was delicious but I genuinely can't give 5 stars because of their need for a better waiting system. They really need to get it together to keep people coming back.	3star
Very authentic hand-pulled noodles and delicious broth. The menu is very extensive, so everyone is bound to find something they like. I came with a party of 4 and were seated in the basement. Very dingy down there. Not somewhere you would go for great ambiance, but if you want delicious food, you won't be disappointed.	4star
"This review is based solely on cocktails and food from the a la carte menu. I came to this establishment in high hopes of finding a new and great cocktail bar but was disappointed. I've been to majority of the speakeasy cocktail bars in NY and this place was a let down. The ""Haiku"" tasted like just straight mezcal with a weird rubbery aftertaste. The ""Boba, Bubble Tea"" has a strong overwhelming taste of alcohol. Not well balanced at all. The ""Chill Pill"" was not well balanced either. A lot of saltiness, spicy and sourness all in one.  As far as the a la carte menu, we ordered the chicken pate. I felt like the peach was overkill and not a good match. The goat cheese purée with raw vegetables was a disappointment. No where near did the purée taste like goat cheese at all! Tasted literally like ranch dressing. Consistency was very watered down and no sense of cheese was experienced at all."	2star
This used to be one of my most favourite restaurants in LIC. Have been a few times and the service, although perhaps a little relaxed, is always friendly and the food cooked to perfection. Perfect French cafe atmoshphere. However last night......  The music was on very very loud.  No one could hear themselves speak. In true French style the staff, ignored multiple requests throughout the meal to turn the volume down.   Maybe they should apply for a liceence to dance..... WARNING:  Do not come here for a meal where you want to talk the the people that you are with. . I think I'd like to try Tournesol for lunch one day (when their iPod may be switched off!).	1star
the drinks were sooo weak.  We ordered drinks at 8:01 and were told we couldn't get happy hour price. We ordered the meat and cheese platter and received 3 pieces of cheese, 4 grapes and five pieces of salami. This was 12 dollars, 12 dollars for nothing. The service was good but the drinks and food were beyond subpar. Don't fall for these reviews. we waited for an hour no food came out so we paid for our drinks and left	1star
The place was spacious with plenty of seating. We nade reservations for our party of 11 so we didn't have to wait.  The menu is just burger and lobsters. There are lots of live lobsters by the bar. I didn't have the combo of a burger and lobster. Thise that had it said the burger was good.  I ordered the buger bites and the lobster bites. Both were good. Sort of reminds me of an eggroll the way they were wrapped. I also had a classic lobster. Tons of meat in the roll. I was happy with it.  The dessert options were eh. The staff was attentive and nice.	4star
We were told that it was a 25 minute wait but ended up waiting for an hour. The food was bland for the most part, which is surprising because I usually think everything is super salty. I was so excited to eat here because I love seafood so much but I was a bit disappointed.  The price is really good for groups and they threw in a free enoki wrapped bacon dish.	3star
Decor and Interior true to the Brooklyn vibe.  Baby and kid friendly; great for large groups (with a reservation).  Brunch menu options are loaded with seemingly fresh ingredients.   What we ordered:  - Smoked salmon panino - so flavorful and fresh! Loved the combination of the smoked salmon with the beets and the avocado.  Loved it on the pumpernickel bread as well.  - Egg in a cloud - neat presentation, however if you're hungry opt for something a bit more filling (like the egg toast) - Egg Toast - a definite stand out! This dish was absolute perfection. Cooked with truffle oil however wasn't too overwhelming.  The asparagus was a perfect complement.  Having something green on your plate after eating essentially cheese baked on top of an amazing brioche makes you feel better ;) Polenta with sausage - This dish was average.  Polenta by itself was flavorless but was better eating it with the sausage.  Overall you won't feel gross and heavy after brunching here.  I will be back to try their dinner!	4star
This place is wonderful! The decor and size of the place is beautiful and simple. The service is outstanding. The beer selection is small, but incredibly well curated (mostly local taps, mostly out-of-state cans/bottles). Don't leave without getting the tacos or the guac, and definitely give the Cuban a shot! I'd come here again in a heartbeat -- they deserve every single one of the 300+ 5-star reviews they've gotten so far!	5star
Highly recommend the spicy wontons which were delicious and not overpowering in terms of how spicy it was.  The pork & chive fried dumplings were kinda meh. It's pretty cheap (4 for $1.50).. but like others have said, the dumpling is dry and the skin was doughy in an unappealing way. There are much better places to get fried dumplings.  While this place is not too small, you will still likely not find a seat if you come during peak hours. I came here on a weekday and all the tables were already filled. However, people eat quickly and I was able to snag a table pretty quickly. The food took awhile to come out (10+ minutes) which is surprising since most dumpling establishments get your food out much quicker.	3star
Ordered the chorizo hot sandwich and the soup of the day- Verdinas.  The chorizo is tasty- little salty and not spicy enough for my taste though. The manchego cheese is plentiful and the bread tastes fresh.  The soup was not what i was expecting. Verdinas is a type of green bean but the soup was more like a hardy chicken soup with lots of carrots, some ham and chorizo blocks and a few green beans. It was delightful but not as expected.  Overall good and will likely be back as I work right around the corner but you gotta go with the flow.	4star
This place is literally a hole in the wall. We had to search hard to find this place. There is a very small door and the inside is even smaller than expected. There is a bit of a wait, but you can order ahead of time while you are waiting, which is good since you can get your food quickly after getting a seat. We ordered the crab & pork dry noodles (which is the most recommended on Yelp) and the beef noodle soup. Both were really good, and I personally really enjoyed the experience because I hadn't tried anything like these dishes at other Thai places. We also ordered the curry puffs, which were incredibly fresh and yummy.  The crab & pork dry noodles were definitely better than what I expected from a dry noodle. The base of the bowl is mixed with fish sauce, and it came with a bowl of what I think is ox bone noodle soup, which was neither salty nor too oily, so it complemented the plate well. The noodles were sweet and chewy and the pork and crab went well with the noodles. The beef noodle soup was also really good. The soup was not too salty and incredibly flavorful. The different types of beef in the soup were also really tender and chewy.  Overall, I would give this place a 5 for food. We had a little awkward moment with an overbearing waitress, which was incredibly uncomfortable, which is why I am giving this place only 4 stars.	4star
SoCo is a cool spot for brunch. It was busy but wait was not too long(10-15min). The atmosphere was inviting and hip. There is an indoor and outdoor area. Loved the music..not too loud and r and b (played my jams ). The waitress was very nice, attentive and prompt. She ensure that our water glasses remained filled and quickly cleared away used plates. Yup, very important to me.  Now the folks who brought out the good, ehhhh not so pleasant. Not sure if it was because it was busy though.  I had the SoCo sangria which was refreshing. I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken with a red velvet waffle. This was good but did not amaze me. This could be because they were out of everything I wanted, like the pancakes or French toast(that's why the lost a star from me).  However, the food was fresh and presented well.  The greatest part of this experience, thanks to Yelp , was my free corn bread on check in ! It was warm, tasty and the honey butter complemented it well.   I plan to revisit to hopefully get the menu items I really wanted to try.	3star
I was really looking forward to this place because of the amazing reviews. I was very disappointed that the food was just OK, and the it was also a little expensive with smaller portions. The place is TINY with a very limited menu with most of it being mac and cheeses. I'm not a big mac and cheese person.  seafood paella- It came with big pieces of fresh shrimps and scallops. The chorizo and pork belly were very hard to chew and it was also very salty. The paella rice itself was very dry and it needed more seasoning.  bacon mac and cheese- pretty good. It was not too cheesy or creamy. The noodles were twisty noodles and it was cooked well with a nice blend of cheeses. The crispy bacon pieces complemented the dish very well.	3star
Over rated. Had the tuna small plate and it was overcooked and waaay over seasoned. TAO salad was drenched in dressing so bad I couldnt eat it. Shoshito peppers saved it, or it would have been 1 star.	2star
"I had this place bookmarked for a while now. Finally I had a chance to try this place with my boyfriend and two other people. The place isn't huge inside and décor is nice. We waited about half an hour for a table. We shared the tatsuta age which is a home style fried marinated chicken. It wasn't what we expected. We expected it to be ""marinated"" with more flavor. It tasted plain but at least it was juicy inside.  We all got a bowl of soba. I had the kamo nanban which is duck soba with green onions. It was just okay. I thought the soba noodles were a bit soggy. The broth was very light in taste.  For dessert, I had the green tea creme brulee. It looks like a creme brulee but it didn't taste like one. When I broke through the caramelized sugar to get to the inside, the custard inside was very soft and watery. This is not what a creme brulee should be like. It is possible that maybe it was an off day. My boyfriend had the mango pudding. He thought his dessert was okay. Everyone thought their dessert should have been creamer.  My favorite soba place is still Cocoron. Their broth is just full of flavor. The soba noodles aren't soggy. Their soba never disappoint. I was disappointed with Soba ya because there were so many good reviews. I like that their broth is light in taste but their dessert just wasn't what we expected. If you come here, I say try their soba but pass on dessert. My boyfriend and I had a stomach ache after dinner. We think it might be the dessert. Overall, not a bad soba place. It could be an off day for the chef. I will give them the benefit of the doubt. Also, it is a little pricer than other places I've been to."	3star
Hole in the wall with legit Shanghai hand pulled noodles. I love hole in the wall spots because first I'm Chinese so the gritty-ness doesn't bother me and second it's usually an indication of real deal homemade Chinese food.  I had the beef stew with regular hand pulled noodles. The noodles were plentiful and chewy the way hand pulled noodles should taste. The broth was just right, wasn't too salty. The beef stew didn't contain that much meat so next time I would probably get a different type but overall everything was good. I also got a take out order of the steamed pork dumplings which didn't have much flavor to them so I'd probably try the fried ones next time	4star
Amazing coal oven pizza. Arrived at 4 pm and didn't have to wait. People arriving 30 min later had to wait 45-60 minutes.	5star
I ate here for dinner. Burger and sausage were OK but the steak was AWFUL. Definitely the worst steak I've tasted in North America	2star
This was my favorite restaurant. I travel from queens often just to eat here. I have always been satisfied even though it is pricey but today- I ordered my favorite as I do every other time. They have me half the amount of food.  I complained stating I was a frequent customer but they refused to do anything. So disappointed. I won't be eating from this place anymore. So much for my favorite restaurant.	1star
Came here several times, and Kuu Ramen hasn't disappointed me yet! I always order Kuu Chili it's so good and big portions which is sometimes I can't even finish it. The service is really good. All the workers are so friendly. I highly recommended to the people who loves ramen also the place is cozy in the busy town!! So don't missed out KUU RAMEN!	5star
I went for Brunch because of a suggestion from a friend. My party and I all got a different version of food on a bagel (BLT/salmon/eggs). It took over 45 minutes to get our food. Yes the staff came up and apologized because there was a big order ahead of us - but other tables who were sat after us got their food before us. Overall it was really disappointing and had discouraged us from coming back. There are so many delicious brunch places in Brooklyn and unfortunately this isn't one of them.	2star
Terrible!!! Food was not worth the money. Sub par service. Plates were either tasteless or too salty. Poor quality truffles with no aroma of truffles. Trying too hard - using too much foam and miso. I would not recommend this place.	1star
So many things that went wrong here. Starting with the food which took FOREVER to come out.. and when it did it was mediocre. We ordered the special of the day and a burrito which we probably could have gotten at the nearby Buddies burrito and Taco instead for cheaper and better. Drinks were mediocre and once again took forever to come out, but nothing was worse than the service itself. The waiters and waitress would straight up disappear for like 20 mins not even making rounds around the dining area. It was so bad that my husband actually had to get up and had the bartender assist us. Definitely ruined what was a nice day out enjoying the sun and sites! Best advice stay away from this place and enjoy your meal elsewhere.	1star
I waited over 90 min for one pizza and I live a half block away. It never arrived, the restaurant doesn't answer the phone calls (I called about 3 times in 20 min period after being way over the estimated delivery time) and I couldn't understand a word the delivery guy said. Horrible. Just horrible. Too late to call other pizzerias which I would have had I known this. Note to myself... never order from here ever again	1star
Honestly came here for the dry aged steaks. They didn't have neither of them. I came in here at 7pm. We ordered the ribeye and the skirt steak. Both were just ok steak. Nothing too exiting. I don't usually ordered ribeye but they didn't have the dry age steaks, therefore, I had no other choice. Truffle fries were delicious. It was just the right amount of truffle oil. I hate when places drown their fries in truffle butter and it becomes overwhelming. But these fries I could've had them all night long. All in all it was an below ok steak. Defiantly had better and most likely won't be back. Unless it's for a mora gimlet.	3star
The steak here is so good. Came here last weekend for my boyfriend's birthday. I was a complete ding dong and thought I could make a reservation for a  Friday night a week beforehand...we ended up getting the reservation for 2:45 pm on a Saturday. The time is a little odd, but not the worst.  My boyfriend and I shared the thick cut bacon, porterhouse for two, and a side of spinach. Everything was delicious. The steak was perfect! We were one of the younger ones at the restaurant so when the waiter brought the steak out he told us to take photos/videos before he served us lol! The porterhouse was cooked perfect at medium rare. It cut like butter. The meat was so soft and delicious.  Peter Luger is definitely the place to go if you are looking for a good steak!	5star
"I've been here many times, but I don't think I'll be returning anymore. Meh. I don't get the hype. It's got a ""hip"" interior, and a really nice backyard...but the service is lackluster, at best. I've gone with one other person and also with groups, and the experience has always been the same...very mediocre. The wines are at Manhattan prices, only really worth it when they have ""ladies night"" when the glasses are half off. The cheese plate, which I've ordered twice, is very small and they made a really big deal once when a big group I was with asked to order a little more bread. The paninis are small too, for the price. I went for a friend's birthday last time I was there and we sat down, ordered 2 bottles of wine, and a bunch of food. They failed to tell us (and there were NO signs, anywhere) that there was going to be a huge poetry reading that night...RIGHT on top of our table. Now, I have no problem with poetry readings, but maybe the waitress should have mentioned that when we ordered? Instead we had no idea, and then it just started...so we basically had to eat and drink in silence, right on top of someone reading poetry about how they felt like they were a lightbulb or something. Awkward. Seriously. I could barely talk to my friends... I consider that bad service for not mentioning anything about that. So if you're into coming here on your MacBook and sitting in a corner and being around that sort of thing and paying A LOT for a little bit of food...yeah, this place is for you. No idea why it's rated so highly though."	2star
This USED to be my favorite local ramen spot. The food is good and the prices are decent. But the service here recently is just unacceptable. Despite not taking reservations, they WILL refuse to seat you at a 4-person table and instead force you to be at the very unsightly bar area facing a wall. There is no reason for declining to seat 2 people other than pure greed in the hopes that a larger party will come. Good job Hashi, I will never be coming back.	1star
This place had a 5 star rating from me before I went back the second time. The first experience here was great. I went with a group of friends and enjoyed a fantastic meal at such an affordable price. The chili oil and wontons are so so good and almost everything I had that day I loved. The black truffle soup dumplings are so worth the extra bucks. If you haven't had them before, they are a treat, but you couldn't eat too many of them. It is great to try and experience. The soup dumplings in general are great and the skin around the dumpling is perfectly thin and delicious.  The second time I came here I was so excited to have another great meal, but it was lackluster at best.  I got the regular beef noddle soup thinking it would be similar to the first one I got, but I think the waitress messed order up. My friend got the beef and broccoli and there was just no flavor there.  I am going to try this place again and hope they just had an off day.	4star
Very nice restaurant ! Great place to go after work . The food is pricey and takes foreverrrrr to come out. I ordered a simple Mac and cheese and ended up waiting about 25 minutes for it . It was very delicious but the serving size was too small. For the price you pay , the amount of food you get should be more.	4star
I'd like to thank Peaches Hothouse for restoring my life. I waltzed in here in here post Kwanzaa crawl after visiting five or so bars and I needed sustenance and Peaches delivered. I'm pretty sure I ate with my eyes closed and inhaled the food without chewing because it was that good. Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes get a special mention for getting the job done. And the bartender for gracing me with much need water.	4star
Came here on NYE, they were short staffed. Even though the venue wasn't popping, my friends and I waited 30 minutes for our drinks.	2star
I've had good and bad experiences here, which is why I can't give them a 4. I love this spot for drinks with colleagues, and brunch has been delicious, but the service is almost always below average. Between waiting forever for our drinks, to waiting forever for a menu, to waiting forever for a refill and for our meals, the wait is a common thread. Once the wait is over, the food and drinks are above average, but I have yet to experience a 4 star meal.	3star
Went last night and WOW....warm, friendly team from the bartender to the owner managers......excellent burger with truffle fries and an amazing Old Fashion! Tiny...but perfect and the locals that were there were awesome....Gina and Michael in the table next to me were lovely! I am checking out the neighborhood and am considering buying here and this place (while dangerous in terms of the yummy food) will be a great place to hangout.....loving the neighborhood and The Alcove is a bonus!!	5star
I am eating the worst lasagna of life! Extremely overcooked noodles that had to be from a box, meat with no seasoning, a tasteless sauce, nondescript cheese at the hefty price of $18... the worst! I definitely recommend any corner deli that allow you to pay for food by weight over this. The only good part was it came quickly lol	1star
This is one of Morimoto's many restaurants that I've gotten the chance to visit and give a try. I've been a fan of chef Morimoto from his appearances at Food Network's Iron Chef series, so I thought I should check some of his more casual spots.  We went in for an early dinner and was seated promptly. Great interiors, love the textured walls and some dramatic lighting decisions to highlight the Sake Bar.  We ordered their Mimiga (Crispy Pig Ear) which was stellar - I typically don't enjoy animal parts but this was clearly an exception. Crispy and seasoned very nicely I can't tell if I'm eating an unusual meat at all. The Tsukemen was great as well, and we wished we ordered more! (We were warned that portions are best for a single person, and we should've listened!)  I am highly considering on coming back next time I'm in town.	5star
I waited over 2 years to try Dinosaur Barbecue again and it was 10 times worst than the last time. There were two other customers that had orders that were incorrect and the customer service is at an all time low. The help that they hire continue to have no customer service or decorum about themselves. The management at the restaurants offer lil or no help to reduce or eliminate your anxiety or bad experience. I don't think the corporate office is concerned either. The last time they offered me a whopping 15% discount off my meal.  You can keep your 15% and spend it on some customer service training	1star
A beautiful bar, great service, fantastic food, lovely room but by far the worst music ever played in a restaurant.  I hope that the owners will cultivate a larger playlist to create a more rounded hip hop/ r&b sound and not just the same auto-tuned artists.	3star
The food was okay, nothing to rave about.  The space is very small and very loud.  We had a rowdy group behind us that we had to tell to be quiet several times.  I was shocked that the server or hostess did not step in.	2star
"Love Sweet Chick in Brooklyn and found that this location lived up to my already high expectations. Excellent southern, comfort food in a cool, yet intimate, yet also fun atmosphere. What to order: THE MAC AND CHEESE (share an order or two..or three) It's outstanding. Every. Single. Time. So creamy and cheesy especially because they use shell pasta instead of macaroni (shells hold more cheese!) My coworker proclaimed this to be the best mac and cheese that she's ever had. We also shared the pork belly appetizer and one of their many ""chicken and waffles"" options, the ""General"" chicken and waffles (broccoli waffles with general tso chicken). I wouldn't have chose that myself and was actually a little skeptical but it ended up being really really tasty. Who even thinks of putting broccoli in waffles?! Honestly, I don't think you can go wrong with any of their menu items but main takeaway: get the MAC AND CHEESE"	4star
Shanghai Asian Manor was a great experience overall. On a Sunday night around 7:30 PM, the wait was about 40 minutes, which we expected since the restaurant is popular and the facility is tiny and crowded. Service was confusing and not particularly friendly, with several different people stopping by our table to complete different functions, but it was also quick and relativity efficient. The least I can say about the food is that it is delicious, authentic, and very reasonably priced. The soup dumplings were great and decently sized; the soup was savory but not too heavy, and the pork was chewy and not too firm. Definitely a must try as a Shanghainese staple and a specialty of this particular restaurant. We also ordered the 红油抄手 (the closest name I can think of in English is spicy dumplings), which were perfectly sweet and spicy, and the beef noodles, which were good and flavorful. Overall, I can find nothing to complain about regarding our experience at Shanghai Asian Manor. For soup dumpling cravings, I would definitely consider coming back here again.	5star
I was not impressed with Street Taco this visit. I was happy they were open late, but upon entering the DJ was playing where the hostess stand would usually be and there was no hostess to be found. She appeared right as we were about to seat ourselves after waiting around awkwardly at the entrance for a couple of minutes. I don't like the idea of writing my order on a piece of paper to give to the server. It's dark inside and just more work for me - isn't that the server's job. The other problem with that is that they don't know which tacos belong to which person, so the food is served on a joint plate and it's now up to me - again, to split the food between each person. They also give you cheap and small paper plates to eat your tacos on which are smaller than the actual taco, so it's impossible to not get the juice that comes out of the taco when you eat it all over the table. They also put the napkins, forks and knives in a container on the table, so again, I have to get my own utensils (and touch all of the forks in the process, because they are in the container with the tongs up). I will give them that the tacos are tasty, but a bit overpriced for the cuts in service explained above.  Lastly, the frozen margarita is really sour and tart - it tastes like you're sucking on a lemon.	2star
I like the food, I like the open 24 hours thing. I'm used to the wait. And I almost got used to the asshole attitude. However, tonight, after waiting for 20 mins and ordering a beer at 3:59 and being told it's 4am I realized it's too much: I GOT SICK OF THE ASSHOLE ATTITUDE	3star
We had a quick light dinner here.  We sat towards the front of the restaurant, but the bar was impressive (think: diner meets speakeasy).  We were seated immediately and service was quick.   The menu had a good mix of small plates, sliders, burgers, flatbreads, and tacos.  (No real entrees.)  The drink menu is impressive and includes more than 20 beers on tap.  The cocktails also looked very intriguing, both on paper and in person!  We asked the waitress a few times what cocktail she was carrying.  I didn't see any happy hour specials. My mom and I weren't super hungry, so we ordered the shrimp tacos and the pulled pork sliders.  The portions looked small, but were very filling. The shrimp tacos were good but very spicy.  The surprise and star of the show was the pulled pork sliders.  I am not a huge BBQ fan, so I was nervous about these, but they were absolutely divine.  The pork melted in your mouth.  The pickled cucumber complemented the pork well.  The meat-bread ratio was perfect. I would definitely go back here, especially for a drink, but I'm not sure I would seek it out.  Everything delicious, but prices seemed a ltitle high (i.e. $14 for 3 sliders and $15 for 3 small tacos).	3star
The food was just okay and the service was equal to that nothing special about this place.	2star
One of my favorite restaurants in the city! The spaghetti was phenomenal! The crunchiness from the parmesan really added to the dish- I cleared up my entire plate within minutes. The service was amazing. I loved the ambiance- very busy and lively with a classy crowd. It's great for dates and lunch/dinner with family/friends. A must try!!	5star
Came here for my birthday dinner cuz I heard the food was delicious. Its okay. I was deciding between 3 stars and 4 stars, I wish there was a 3.5... The other people in my party enjoyed it, I wasn't too impressed. My dish had a bit of a burnt taste to it but overall it was okay. Nothing bad... just okay.	3star
We sat outside on a Sunday 1pm. No wait, many seats.  Prefix $17 one drink (mimosa, sangria, house wine, or Bloody Mary) + one of 3 entrees + coffee.  I got the chivito sandwich +$1. It was very messy to eat, and mediocre. Nothing spectacular. The empanadas looked really good, we did not order this.  The atmosphere is v vintage.  Heard good things about the salmon crepe.	3star
My first official boozy brunch in the city, but I don't think many places can beat this one. We got there around 1 pm without a reservation and waited about 30ish minutes until a spot in the lounge opened up for 4. Worth the wait! AMAZING DEAL. Unlimited GIANT & DELICIOUS glasses of sangria with a purchase of an entree. To top it all off, the food is actually really good too! I got the vaca frita $24 and it was amazing! It was a super tender skirt steak on top a bed of Latin pork fried rice with tomato/onion veggies, avocado, and eggs. Everything about it was amazing. The sangrias are huge and very strong! They have all types of whites and reds. The white with lychee and coconut and tropical were my faves. Fresas red was also very good! This place is just awesome, idk what else to say haha	5star
Oh, how I was looking forward to a Mexican restaurant in Brooklyn Heights to call my 2nd home... but this one doesn't yet deliver! Gallito's, I want to love you, but you guys need some serious changes to survive. Read on for some schooling... 1) First off, food is overprice and bland. Sorry, I know those tortillas were homemade, but they have no flavor!! Seriously bland! Likewise, the salsa was boring and equally bland... and what's up with serving salsa in a bowl designed for soy sauce? Salsa is not that expensive to make--pour it on! 2) Fajitas should come on a sizzling skillet. It's just the way it should be!!! No question!  Also, the pollo fajitas were cold on my plate, portions were small, and the taste was meh! Finally, to top it off, they cost $19. Yikes! I should have hit up Applebee's instead--that way I would have had more flavor, a lot bigger portion, and a hot meal instead of a barely warm one. 3) No margaritas?!?! I hope you guys applied for a liquor license because that is unacceptable!!! 4) The side of rice & beans were tasty enough but, again, served lukewarm. This was a problem for most of the items my party tried. I understand what the owners are going for--a slightly more upscale twist on traditional Mexican fare. The gourmet punch (e.g., pumpkin seeds, butternut squash, etc. combined with Mexican standards) seems like a cool idea... I get it. But, please, ghetto it up a bit! Bring out some BIG flavor, some BIG portions, and LOWER the prices! Also bring in some margaritas (not fake ones with Agave because you don't have a liquor license)... maybe then patrons might be more forgiving of lackluster food. Note that the staff is great at Gallito's... and the decor and interior are inviting. I'd like to give this place another try if changes are made. It's close by my house, and they serve my favorite cuisine... I'd love to see these folks survive.	2star
Never been to a restaurant that doesn't have print menus. They hang posters on the wall hand written and in small prints. The waitress doesn't appear to be very interested. Overall it feel more suited to be a take out place than a sit down restaurant. They don't even give you water. The food is mediocre.	1star
The chicken is fantastic but the phone system is a disaster.  Very difficult to get through and very noisy when you do get through.  The manager gives you an attitude when the problem is raised.  May not be worth while as there are so many other great places for Korean chicken nearby!	2star
Amazing. Every dish. First off, expect a wait if you come during peak dinner time, even on weekdays. They don't take reservations (which I'm sure you know by now) but you can put your name down and get a drink nearby and they will text you when the table is ready. For all you vegetarians, there are so many veggie options!! We got: Truffle mac and cheese (without clams) and edamame dumplings which were my favorite dishes - definitely a must try! The mapo tofu was spicy and flavorful, the cauliflower fried rice was simple but very good, and the gnocchi was also very flavorful! We finished off with matcha bread pudding which was sweet goodness. Between 4 of us, we were adequately stuffed with 5 dishes and a dessert. I'll definitely be coming back!	5star
I've been avoiding coming here because restaurants with a lot of hype always leave me with high expectation and inevitable disappointment. This wasn't the case for Soco. I was pleasantly surprised. The food was great, the decor was nice, the staff was friendly. The food did take a little long to come out. It was about a 30 minute wait for 2 entrees and a side. It was early in the afternoon and the restaurant almost empty so I had to knock off a star for that. I had their famous chicken and waffles. The chicken was tender and juicy, the waffle was the right amount of sweet on its own. I tried with syrup just to see how it would taste and it was way too sweet for me. I suggest trying it without the syrup first. The portion size was a little on the smaller side so if you're looking for a hefty entree, this isn't it. My girlfriend got the Soul Fried Chicken Sandwich with Garlic Dusted Fries. She loved everything about it. The portion size was great. The real star was the Mac And Cheese. WOW! I don't know who's grandmother they have locked up in the basement making this Mac and Cheese but bless her soul. One of the best Mac and Cheese's I've ever had. Portion size was great on this one too. I'll definitely be back here.	4star
I think only ok tapas and beer I ate  here few place  and wasn't fresh and taste  not great.	2star
After a day of strolling through Bryant Park, Justin M and I decided to grab a drink and do happy hour to celebrate our day off. We saw that this place had a decent happy hour so we stopped in. We were the first ones in for HH but then people started filing in eventually and the bar was about half way full.  The place has a romantic, dimly lit interior which I think is a nice touch but if your eyesight isn't the best be prepared to use that flashlight on your phone! I started off with a blood orange jalapeño infused margarita which was out of this world! I had about 2 more of them through out the night. Justin had a ginger beer cocktail, which was also good, but he switched to the margarita after he had a sip of mine. Later in the night I switched to the rosé on the HH menu since it was ending soon. The bartender gave me a weak pour with barely half a glass of wine which was kinda annoying... They had the HH specials out on the bar and to our disappointment they had no $1 oyster specials as we saw on yelp (seasonal deal?). So we settled for the fried pickles and the Korean style wings. Both were delicious but the wings were very small and we only got 6 for $10. Ugh. We were still hungry so we decided to split the short rib sandwich. Awful. The meat was so dry and tasteless we could barely get through it.  If I ever came back here, which would be unlikely, it would be just for the HH specials because the food was just okay and the service was subpar. There were plenty of things wrong with our order but our bartender was so unfriendly and absent that we just wanted to get the heck out of dodge and just asked for our check (which took like 20 minutes to get). Maybe we came in on an off night for this place because we saw it had such good reviews, but we were unimpressed.	2star
Great brunch on the weekend near the waterfront area in Brooklyn! Restaurant is small and pretty busy. Reservations are probably a good idea. We didn't have one so we sat at the bar and got a bottle of wine and ordered food. The bartender was very attentive. We really enjoyed the croque monsieur and cobb salad.	4star
Ordered delivery through Yelp Eat24 site, but the place didn't receive the order until an hour after we placed it, which was odd. They offered us a free dessert to make up for it, so that was good! Otherwise, the food here was great from what we were finally delivered. We got the  - Club Sandwich, side of fries (flavors were good, but the tomato was cut too thickly and the entire sandwich kind of fell apart) - Crispy Quinoa with Avo & Feta (really interesting texture of this salad; takes some time getting used to if you're only familiar with quinoa being soft) - Reuben (gluten-free bread kept my friend super happy with her choice, it looked good) - Mashed Potatoes with Pesto (doesn't look too appetizing but good comfort food choice) We had the  - Chocolate Molten Gluten-Free cake for dessert, which was actually divine. We topped it off with a dulce de leche cream sauce and it came with fresh berries, too. Overall a solid delivery option in Bushwick for comfort food.	3star
Service was good and pork buns were average. The tonkotsu ramen was not as good as other tonkotsu ramen shops in NYC (ippudo, hidechan, junmen, zundoya) and wasn't that impressed. The presentation was great, atmosphere was clean and on point but the food just wasn't there. Maybe it was an off day so will update this the next time he ends up there.	3star
I just got a mouthful of sand with my first bite of tiger salad.  Also, for the first time I decided to try their lamb dumplings: Dear Americans, it may be a dumpling in a very VERY loose sense of the word but no self respecting Chinese national would buy this dish a second time because it's... offensive.	1star
Momosan is a great place to grab dinner in the city. They serve delicious ramen and drinks! It is a popular spot so I recommend coming here on a weeknight. We ate here on a Tuesday night and got a table in about 10 minutes. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen with a soft boiled egg. The ramen broth was delicious. It was deep and not too salty. Each table also has a set of condiments for you to customize the taste of your ramen. I suggest adding a bit of pepper and sesame seeds! The noodles were also cooked perfectly as well. We also ordered the pork belly appetizer which was amazing! The pork belly is braised and fall apart tender. It comes out on a sizzling dish on a bed of cabbage. I highly recommend it. Note that this is a very casual environment. The tables are long and you will be seated with other parties. Overall it was a great experience! Would definitely recommend	4star
The food is pretty decent for the airport. For $12 I had a tasty poulet sandwich. The service was ok until I noticed a fly in my $11 beer. I told the waiter and he promptly poured out the glass. I patiently waited for the replacement that never came. We were still charged for the beer I never drank.  Unacceptable and unapologetic.	2star
Pleasant old school NYC saloon in the theater district -- with a decent pub menu at reasonable prices. My lamb burger over a well seasoned avocado salad with a fried egg on top was just what I wanted -- plenty for two and cooked perfectly.   The apps we ordered were basic -- deviled eggs and sliders, chicken wings, grilled shishito peppers -- but the best of them were the ahi tuna over avocado and the pork belly over guacamole and chips.  Both went well with our bourbon based cocktails, ate a cut above typical bar food and were nicely presented.    If you don't want the hassle of a sit down meal at one of the area tourist traps -- Dutch Freds is a fine place to spend a couple of hours shmoozin and boozin before a show.	3star
This place was extremely disappointing. My husband and I wanted to give it a second chance because it was disappointing the first time and it was actually worse. We had the paella and the rice was very dry and tasteless as well as the miniscule amount of seafood and chorizo. That wouldn't have been so bad if at least the mojitos and drinkswere good. But they were not. We are lovers of Cuban food and this place was, sadly, not up to par at all. Save your money and go to Son Cubanos instead.	1star
My boyfriend was in the mood for lambchops so I googled the best lambchops in NYC and Kikis came up. When we arrived it was a 20minute wait for 2. At first we were seated by a table that was in the back next to the restrooms. Everyone that was standing in line for the restrooms were basically on our backs and everytime the door opened we could smell the toilet so I asked to be moved. They moved us immediately without a problem.        So the reviews said that the best things on the menu were the grilled octopus, grilled fish and the lambchops so that's we ordered. NOTHING WAS SEASONED AND EVERYTHING TASTE BURNT! I'm not even exaggerating. The waitress noticed that I only took one bite of the octopus and put it to the side so she offered to take it off the bill for me. The fish smelled like it wasn't cleaned, just thrown on the grill and left there to burn. And the same goes for the lambchops, tasted like charcoal.         I have this place 1 star because of the ambiance and the hospitality... But besides that, I wouldn't recommend this place if you really want great tasting food	1star
BRUNCH FAIL!  There was never sugar on the table for the coffee, I didn't have silverware and had to ask.  The fires not cooked well, cold eggs Benedict and the French toast was weak...  with pineapple and Mellon?  Where's the blueberries?  Never had water at our table while other tables did.  My second and last time going to this establishment.  Besides a cute garden the space is very underwhelming and over priced.	1star
"One chicken pot pie, one fish sandwich, 2 Negronis and a lemonade: $89 with tip.  It should be called ""The Greenback Table"". A tourist trap, as all of the Chelsea Market is. It rides on the hype, not the substance. I had the pot pie.  The ""puff pastry topping"" was so hard as to be inedible. The insides tasted of Campbell soup.  Half of the menu consists of cheese sandwiches.  An hour after we got home, we were already hungry..I'd rather have a genuine inorganic NYC hotdog!"	1star
I had the best experience here today! My husband and I went to The Alcove at around 5 for a few drinks and a bite to eat. The eclectic and broad selection of craft beer was impressive and the food was fresh and tasty. I got a Cajun chicken burrito. The chicken was flavorful and juicy with just the right amount of spice. My husband got a Cuban and loved it. Beyond the impressive food and drink was the service which was nothing short of outstanding. Every worker, not only our waitress, went out of their way to make sure we were satisfied. The staff made the environment welcoming and comfortable. I will absolutely return very soon!	5star
Love this hole in the wall near time square. One of the most authentic taco places in nyc	5star
2 stars for decent food!  Tomato salad good, super fresh heirlooms, vinaigrette grainy though.. assuming sesame seeds not properly strained. Pretty sloppy for a restaurant of that style and price Pizza great, seasoned perfectly. Too much dry oregano. Lost the others because we were basically ignored by server.  Walked in around mid afternoon, we only ordered 2 items. I guess check wasn't big enough to be taken care of properly, or other pressing conversations with staff in restaurant more important.  Nice place. Sad service.	2star
Fried Chicken Fillet Noodle soup is a must. Braised beef Noodle soup is awesome with a touch of soya. Tangbao s are really good. (Y2,Y3) A place with food for value.	5star
Such a disappointment.  With the exception of our snobbish waiter who was easily-peeved that I simply asked for the price on one of the specials, the rest of the staff was great. However, because of the tone set by the waiter overall, I lost my appetite and didn't even order another large dish as intended out of principle.  Ambience/decor was lovely here. However focusing on the food and being asian as well as having in-laws who are Laotian (therefore I've had some of the best Laotian homecooking for many years), this place failed horribly. First, their papaya salad tasted more like kim chi. It was extremely sour more than spicy and not a hint of shrimp or even fishsauce for that matter. To fail on papaya salad for any southeast asian restaurant is pretty unacceptable, especially for a Laos-inspired one. Forget about the fact also that said waiter scoffed when I asked if they could possibly tone down the spicy level for the sake of my 6-year old daughter. I've lived in Tribeca for over 11.5 years and never have I encountered such lousy service, and I've eaten at Nobu, Tribeca Grill, and the rest of the best in the area. I find it audacious & rich that a lead waiter at a place where they all wear t-shirts is going to come off like this. It took so much effort not to followup with him aside. He later seemed to self-correct as if realizing that I wasn't exactly thrilled with him but damage was already done. Wife says he was apparently pressured or upset by the hostess or manager before dealing with us, but it's still inexcusable. Next, there was the beefy jerky. An insult as far as price for the amount of meat although it was pretty tasty. The only saving grace of a dish that somewhat made up for all of the food disappointments was their chili buttermilk whole chicken large special dish. Also, the Wok Seered Lobster Pad See Ew was decent but again overpriced for the meager portion. Doubt I'd ever go back after our experience tonight there...granted there are other regular dishes I would've liked to have given a chance to down the road. However, between lousy, small dish portions that were overpriced as well as more needed work on guest service (as far as this particular waiter anyhow), I certainly wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. I'm even hesitant quite honestly about finally checking out Marc Forgione nearby, but we'll see.	2star
I am really sad writing this review because this used to be my go-to spot but over the past year the quality of food has gone downhill. I used to die for their veggie balls with pesto sauce and their parmesan cream sauce was delicious as well. Now I think they changed their veggie balls to make them vegan friendly or something like that and they just aren't good anymore. Giant chunks of hard carrot and big strings of onion make up 85% of the ball. I end up sitting there eating around all of the chunks. They're such a weird consistency now. Their pesto also is different. It was super dry and bland the last time I ordered it, practically no oil at all and their cream sauce was lacking flavor as well. I don't know if they changed up those recipes as well or if that particular cook just happened to mess up but it was so disappointing. I figured I could still enjoy their homemade ice cream but even that seemed off. Their espresso ice cream used to have specks of espresso throughout and a strong coffee taste. When I got it last weekend there was barely any evidence of espresso in it at all. Tasted like they mixed chocolate with vanilla and just a dash of coffee and it was the consistency of a Wendy's frosty rather than the solid scoop of ice cream I used to get. Perhaps a freezer issue was to blame for the melted consistency but it was definitely different quality across the board. The only complaint I used to have about this place was the fact that they got rid of Bitches Brew which was an AMAZING drink but now I feel like they got rid of all of the things that made their food delicious and replaced it with subpar stuff. I want to still love you MBS, really I do, but you've changed AND I FEEL LIKE I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU ANYMORE!!	2star
"This place just denied serving my girlfriend and I because they decided to ""close early"" on a monday night. We came in at 9:30, when their hours on both yelp and google state that they're open until 11. Honestly, their food is mediocre at best. I've eaten here in the past, reluctantly. They serve overpriced, uninspired dishes that aren't half of what you can get at Roberta's, just a couple of subway stops away. Skip this poor excuse of a business and take your money elsewhere, where posted hours are honored and customers are welcomed, not turned away."	1star
Great food and really affordable. Sadly their current lease ended on July 31st 2017. They are trying to find a new place to reopen the store. Will keep your guys posted if I know the new location.	5star
Review for the tomato and basil spaghetti only!! It truly is the best spaghetti you can ever find. Pasta is perfectly cooked and the sauce coats it lusciously. It has just the right amount of sauce with the right amount of saltiness.  Plate-licking worthy!! I don't remember any other food I ate there haha.  Get the spaghetti	5star
Brunch review: if you're on the east side, above 34th street, The Smith is where you wanna go. It's a solid brunch spot with cool vibes, delicious food, and great service.  Here are the top things you should know: 1. Great sized portions. Especially for the price. Completely worth it and you will be full. 2. Sicilian baked eggs. All the way. This is the absolute must-get brunch dish. 3. Tap and sparkling water refills. Completely incredible. 4. Service is solid. Everyone was friendly and attentive. 5. Everything here is Instagram worthy.  It's a popular brunch spot so expect some sort of wait, especially for larger parties. There are other locations,  but I honestly thing the the one in Midtown East is the best one.	4star
Terribly disappointed with tonight's meal. Ruined the entire mood and night.  I've always had good experiences at other Smith locations - I usually go to the one in NoMad. Anyways, tonight we sat at the bar since the wait was vicious. We had to set our meal ourselves. The server threw us silverware and a bread, and cups, and we had to beg for water. The bread was stale, so that was a good way to start the meal.  We ordered calamari to start, gnocchi and a burger. The calamari was cold and some parts were uncooked. The fried part was also terrible. The gnocchi was good flavor. However, the gnocchi was served cold / lukewarm at BEST, and they gave me 10 pieces total. Ten. That's it. For $20+ dollars... that's garbage price. Let's not get cocky; The Smith isn't that upscale nor is it a Michelin. They don't need to short their entrees by that much.  Lastly, the burger was pretty good. Everything was cooked right, with the right taste overall. It kind of tasted like a Big Mac, but no problem with that. The fries tastes like a pound of salt, but I guess that's not surprising.  Throughout this visit, not once were we asked how our meal was nor did a server once stop by. Tipped fairly but now in retrospect, not sure why when service was nonexistent.	1star
Everything about this place is exactly as it should be.  Not fussy, just good BBQ with great beer and the largest Bourbon selection I've ever seen.  The Broccoli Salad and Baked Beans are the best sides, and the pulled pork, brisket, ribs, pork belly and pastrami are all delicious. They were out of chicken unfortunately, but it gives us a good excuse to come back. It lives up to the hype.	5star
Guys, I'll be honest. This might be the worst Mexican food I have ever had, in my whole entire life. Munster on nachos?! Instead of ceviche that is light and citrusy, it's simultaneously oily, heavy, and bland. We ordered guacamole and asked for it to be prepared spicy with jalapeños. Friends, I shit you not, it came out with pickled jalapeños instead of fresh. Seriously, somehow even the rice is repulsive. The salsa is basically seasoned ketchup. If you have ever had good -or even passable- Mexican (interior or border), Tex-Mex, Mexicali, this place might kill your belief in the goodness of mankind. If you like spicy food, this will propel you into flavor nihilism. If you can pronounce Oaxaca, the shocking and aggressive mediocrity of this food might make you forget who you are. My apologies for the hyperbole, but I just need to emphasize that this is a hard, hard pass.	1star
Fish is a neighborhood restaurant that's been around for years. I went in today with a craving for fish and chips. After this experience, I won't be returning. Here were the issues: 1) the cod in the fish and chips was old. How do I know? The distinct ammonia taste that old fish gets. When I told the server, she apologized and then asked the chef what was up. He had the balls to say that it tasted that way because one or two pieces were overcooked. I mean, REALLY?!?! (BTW, the chips were pretty good, though). 2) The server offered us to choose something else from the menu. I opted for a lobster bisque, my partner asked for a lobster salad. The bisque took forever to come out and  the taste was burnt and bitter; really awful. The lobster salad had tiny old and dried pieces of lobster in it, clearly leftovers from another day and old ingredients. (The avocado in the salad, however, was perfect.) Laying underneath the salad were crumbles of bacon, which is problematic as my partner doesn't eat pork. Unfortunately, we didn't know this as when we were asked to order something else, my partner looked at a neighboring table and said he'd have that salad and didn't think to review the ingredients on the menu. 3) Service was pretty slow. It was very courteous, but damn slow and hard to get the servers' attention. Mind you, the restaurant was pretty empty with only two other tables occupied. 4) We were charged for both orders of fish and chips, but not for the bisque or lobster salad.  (And on the way home, a few blocks away, guess who got the runs?) Never again.	1star
My friend took me here because she wanted to try it and it had good reviews. Not sure why... I had #2 on the menu with pork belly buns. The bun had too much mayo in it.. first time trying a bun with mayo. I wish they didnt put that in. It was just a chunk of fat pork smushed between a bun. The ramen was okay..I've had other ramen in new york and I would probs rate this place at the bottom.	2star
Love me some pizza.  This place did hit the spot,  but I was expecting a little more flavor from the pizza. The inside decor is nice, but the men's restroom is right by the kitchen which is a little weird. The overall service was good and the wait can get a little long, I am guessing on the certain time you go, but they get you in and out pretty fast.	3star
If you are vapid, don't appreciate good food, helpful service, courteous service, or orders that arrive at your table correctly, have we got your dream restaurant! We came for brunch on Sunday and were seated in a near empty dining room. We assumed we'd have great service since there was only out party (of 8) to pay attention to. It was amazing how hard it was to place our order--nobody was checking on us--and when the food came without one of the plates wed ordered (a bowl with a basic from the kitchen, no cooking involved), we had to beg three different waiters and it finally came 15 minutes later, after we'd eaten. The food they did get right was underwhelming-- at least the tiny portions were. You can buy a tote bag from Ralph Lauren's daughter in law at the adjoining shop so there's that.	1star
For the sandwiches alone, I would give Katz a solid 3.5/4 stars. It was pretty damn good pastrami. The ~$25 price point is a little on the steep end, but given that it's New York, i can let it slide. Given the size of the sandwich and the amount of pastrami you get in each, I could justify coming here every once in a while for what could potentially be split into a big dinner or two smaller meals.  However, the system that they put in place at Katz, while I am sure they implemented it with the hopes of being more efficient, seems grossly inefficient and poorly executed. First off, despite there being multiple people at the door, they do not AT ALL inform you on why you are getting a ticket, what to do with it, how you use it to check out, etc. The signage around the restaurant is terrible. If you are a first timer or a tourist, please keep in mind: 1) each person gets their own ticket, regardless of whether or not you're in a group or paying together. 2) you must keep your ticket - don't misplace or throw it away. You'll be subject to a fine. 3) if you need to step out of the restaurant to make a phone call or get fresh air, you will be heckled at the door and have your ticket taken and/or reissued to you. 4) You check out at the end when you provide your ticket or tickets if you're paying for multiple parties.  Honestly, I feel like they do an intentionally bad job explaining to be able to incur fines. There is no other reason for it. The people working the door generally did not seem to give a flying fork. Similarly, the staff at Katz would start setting up other tables and ushering people to the other side of the restaurant to be seated - without any explanation. The sandwich was good, but everything else about the service was not only just average (which would be acceptable for a casual diner!), but was just so poor and intentionally aloof.	3star
I came here on a Friday night and there were still tables available, which was great! I found the place to be a tad loud even though it wasn't full. To start, I got a baby arugula with beets and feta salad. It was a very refreshing salad, but it also isn't a very original idea. Enjoyed it nonetheless. As the main, I got the Fettuccine with mussels, clams and shrimp in a shellfish ragu. The dish was alright. I found the slices of garlic in the pasta sauce overwhelming every time it was in my biteful of pasta, I wished they were smaller pieces. The homemade fettucine was enjoyable, but not as good as other homemade pasta I've had. And the sauce was slightly fishy, but tolerable.  It was a good experience, but I've had better Italian food.	3star
I like how casual this place is, but if you're here for outstanding food, probably not your place to be. It's definitely a great value and a great place for a group. My friend got a takeout box with kimbap, kimchi, bulgogi, fried rice, and dukbokki. I think all the food was mediocre, if not lacking. Maybe we just didn't choose the good items or it was sitting out for a while since it was kind of late, but it won't defer us from coming here again. My friends and I were mainly here to drink a little before going to a show. You buy your alcoholic beverages of choice and the cashier will give you the same number of cups as IDs. It was a good time and we could sit for as long as we want. Would come back, just didn't think the food was special.	3star
It's my second time here and again it was very oily!! The amount of oil and cumin that was in my dish I normally don't consume for a whole week. I'm posting a picture in case you think I'm exaggerating . The noodles are tasty! Please don't use so much oil!!	2star
Very average. Staff was attentive.  Ordered fried chicken, cheese waffles, and deviled eggs. Nothing exceptional about any of it except the price tag.  The eggs that were deviled seemed smaller than average.  That being said I do want to try other items there. The pictures still entice me and I did order pretty average fare. People seem to love them so I'll try again.	3star
Everything about this place deserve 5 stars!  But the wait time of more 2 hours...  Otherwise, awesome tapas, great vibes! MUST try Adult Capri-sun!! We ordered kimchi paella, truffle Mac n Cheese, crispy chicken, ugly potato, and angry sweet potato!  KIMCHI PAELLA: This dish was not as spicy as anticipated but kimchi and seafood was perfectly balanced. TRUFFLE MAC N CHEESE: i'd definitely return for this dish! It was creamy, cheesy, and had enough flavor of truffle but not overwhelming. CRISPY CHICKEN: this dish was crispy and I thought that the sauce was too sweet. Otherwise, great pair with beer. UGLY POTATO: this was actually a pretty dish!  ANGRY SWEET POTATO: perfect balance of baked non-greasy fries with sriracha goat cheese. The sauce has a nice kick which elevates the taste of the fries and texture to another level!	4star
The cocktails. So good. I've tried at least 5 of them. Loved them all. If it's your first time and you're into a little smokiness, you've got to try the working class hero.  Definitely come for the cocktails, but the food is great too! This place is a rare find in mid-town and a go-to recommendation for guests in town.	5star
We came in a group of 9 and the younger looking waitress took our order then disappeared. 3 out of 9 orders came to our table after about 20 mins and then nothing for 40 mins. Went to ask another waitress about our order and turns out the kitchen had forgotten the rest. Seriously?  Would not come back. At least not with more than 4 people... UPDATE  Gave this place another shot yesterday with 4 coworkers for our lunch break. Wasn't too busy on a Friday. Service was better. Kitchen didn't forget about our orders this time BUT we did find a fairly large chunk of plastic piece from the cap of the plastic containers in the white curry noodle soup... If someone was eating in a hurry would've definitely choked on it... Sorry, Wok Wok, that was your last chance to win us over.	1star
Very disappointed in the food. The portions were small, the korean fried chicken taste like typical Chinese food.  I tried both the chicken and the rib eye (rib eye was better of the two) buns, even had two different types of chicken buns.  Will not visit again and could have spent my money elsewhere.	2star
So I wasn't going to bring it out into the public except for Yelp of course. Yesterday I went out with  my fiancé, and two other people for a small business meeting. For the first time in my life faced racial discrimination to some degree. After an hour of waiting, we were served a table. Being a 'cook your own food' kind a place, the waiters harassed us and constantly shut off our grill WHILE I still had raw meat on my plate and raw meat/pork on the grill. THREE times. A black couple with their 2 young kids as well as a white family at another table were also seated at the same time. The black couple were also harassed and had their grill shut off without any word from their waiter.  Kids were given marshmallows to make s'mores but the waitress shut off the grill on purpose? Why do that to the children and have them hurried out? Not ONCE was the white family told to leave, that's their time was up, had their grills shut off before they finishing cooking their food. Yes the black family had to leave with us while the white family was able to stay and hang out We were told 'it's 5:30pm. You need to leave. It wasn't like we were just taking up space. We were consistent with ordering throughout our stay but was still told to leave by more than 3 waiters. They continuously said we need to go and we have to leave. We should have left by 530. Needless to say, our butts did NOT leave until 630 while we kept receiving ugly, disgusting smirks and stares from the staff. I took pictures of the receipt for proof but for the safety of the staff I won't upload it.  Eunice was our waiter and he continuously rushed us out.  RITA, the manager in charge didn't give two shits about our issue. She simply said 'thanks, I'll look into it' Fun Fact:: She was the one who printed out our check and had the waiter pass us the check, 'Here you go, have a good day' with his fake ass smile.  NOTE TO EVERYBODY HERE: IF THE MANAGERS REPLY TO YOR COMMENT, it is a LIE. THEY WILL NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. Just look at the reviews....over the past few months the complaints are consistently about the same people.  Thanks a lot Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ for your disgusting service. Yea I'm peeved. I spread this complaint through their facebooks, youtube, and 3 of methods of social media. Hopefully you close down soon so we can get some real customer service up in here	1star
Pizza are good but exces water in mozzarella on my pizza.  the service is very bad the waiter bring me a beer and he spill it on me and my pants !!! ....	1star
This was the first time I tried The Kati Roll Company. I was interested in trying out this place by the sheer number of yelp reviews and likes. The service seemed pretty quick. I ordered an Achari Paneer Roll and Masala chai. The chai was decent with no sugar added which I found to be a good idea so that people who want to avoid sugar can do so. However, the paneer roll was trash. The paneer had no 'achari' flavor. It was dry and there were such huge pieces of it in the roll that I had to add some ketchup on hand to make it go down my throat. This could be a complete different thing with the meat options but for paneer it is very bad. The roti in which the paneer was folded was partly cooked and hence I could feel the raw dough taste in my mouth. They should have added more sauce in the roll to make it flavorful and less doughy. Overall I regret going to them for my vegetarian meal fix.  Thanks Kati Roll Company for spoiling my appetite at a time when I was sooo soo hungry.  Good luck!	2star
Very very very good food, nice service and this space is gorgeous.  Their vegetarian entres could definitely be much more substantial for the price, and include some vegetable protein, mushrooms or eggplant, anything just to make it feel like a full meal and not a large side dish. But it's still delicious. All of the food here is delicious.	4star
I went here last night with my friends for a girls night out. I had a waiter who was the worst. (white male, low ponytail) He had us waiting around for long periods of time. It appeared as if he wanted to just stay behind the bar and serve drinks, which did not make any sense since there was already 3 other bartenders. It seemed as if we were bothering him to be honest.  he never refilled our table water bottle even though he was asked several times. The worst part was it was not even busy in the restaurant! Me and my friends will never be stepping foot in here ever again. Be warned.	1star
We came here after reading Yelp reviews. Sat at the bar while waiting 20 minutes for a table (which we declined)...ordered the rigatoni w/ broccoli & Italian sausage, with garlic & oil sauce. Delicious! So was the Sangiovese! Junior was our server & he was great!	5star
Can't say I loved this place. I was super excited to try it and had high hopes. Our waitress wasn't rude but she didn't seem interested. We asked for Seltzer ... they gave us Sprite. We asked the busboy if refills were free and he said he didn't know. (They aren't free). It was the details that were missed ... no serving spoons with the shared items, napkins etc ... The Mac and Cheese was just ok. The wings average. My smoked meat sandwich was pretty good. The actual restaurant is super cute and there isn't another place like it in the area so hopefully they step it up.	3star
Highly quality food in a tiny restaurant. The seafood bisque is godly. Get the lobster roll if you want to be touristy.	4star
Swung by on a Friday night for drinks with friends after a dinner nearby. The place was hopping and we thankfully managed to snag half of a table. One of the major draws of this place is the vast outside seating area which can seat a bunch of people.  However, it does take a long time to get drinks and food, wasn't worth waiting for food. The margarita was good and they have a small selection of decent beers. Will come here again if I am ever in the area during the summertime. Remember that it is CASH ONLY!	3star
The person taking the delivery on the phone didn't know what 'basil fried rice' is. Smh.  After waiting one hour I received noodles for my 'basil fried rice'	1star
Prior to coming to Cecconi's, we had seen the dozens of scathing reviews of this place, but my girlfriend and I decided to give it a try because it was difficult to get a reservation and we had heard good things about their outposts in other cities. Boy were we we wrong. Yes, the location is beautiful and the decor is great. The service was sub par and the food was nothing to write home about. $34 for a few pieces of lobster on undercooked pasta? No thanks. The service was lacking, we had to ask several times throughout the meal to have water poured and we had to ask several times for them to fix a wobbling table. The waiters did not know what was available on the menu and could not tell me what specials they had or what beers they had on tap. The wine and aperol spritzs were tasty. Will not be coming back here. There are better restaurants in the area with the same beautiful views and with better food and better service. We sincerely wanted to like this place and give it a try and we appreciated the fact that a representative from the restaurant is responding to their negative reviews but it just doesn't cut it.	2star
Came here for brunch Ambience: Very small place,  simple with French pictures on the wall. Service: My friends couldn't go earlier so I called to verify if we would still be seated if we got there at 2:30pm. The guy on the phone indicated that as long as we were there by 2:45pm we were good. So we got there at 2:30 and he seemed a bit disappointed  we were there (they close at 3pm to get ready for dinner). His customer service skills were very French aka rude; took me back to the time I went to Paris. Food: The French toast was heavenly. The croque Monseiur was pretty good but they burnt one of the sides of the bread. My other friends loved their dishes as well. The sangria was just ok. Price for brunch was pretty sweet. I would like to come back for dinner, because the dishes look pretty amazing. Quality of food is pretty good  but just be ready to embrace the rudeness Oui Oui!	3star
OK so twice in a row the place smells like the mop they use for the bathroom was also used in the dining room. Oh and the waitress was rude, nervous--and slow! The food, if you can stomach the smell of the room, is average, i.e. over-sized portions of greasy Greek fare.	1star
Met up with a few friends for a Sunday brunch at this well-reviewed spot in Murray Hill. Awesome ambiance w/exposed brick, tin ceilings, a cozy feeling, comfy wooden benches, and eclectic decor. You may find you want to hang out here well after you are done w/your meal and/or drink. The front houses the bar w/dining in the back and a secondary dining area/bar/private dining room downstairs. I got a mimosa w/my meal which was made well. Someone got the elixir special cocktail for $8 which was inventive and refreshing - would not have ordered something w/carrot juice, agave, and gin together but these flavors combine together well for a good brunch cocktail.  They start you off w/great complimentary mini muffins which were delicious.  I got the baked eggs ($14) for my meal which I liked though did not love. Not a ton of veggie options on the menu if you are looking for a vegetarian option.  While the eggs were well cooked - the dish seemed overloaded w/beans and not enough broth. The bread was also not substantial enough to really dip in the eggs. Other dishes (ordered in my group) like the hanger steak and omelette looked and tasted much better. Both came with delicious potatoes.  Service wasn't the greatest. There was one huge party in the restaurant which meant it was hard to find anyone to get a refill, order a drink, and/or get anything extra. The waitstaff was friendly enough but just seemed overwhelmed w/that party.  Would certainly make a return visit when in the neighborhood again!	3star
I would have given them 3 stars but I hosted a wedding party here and lost my veil. I gave it to the attending waiters of our party. I requested for assistance but none of them helped and retrieved my veil.	1star
It's pretty average Italian at best. Poorly seasoned and very slow service. There's way better options on court street.	2star
Disappointed.  The meat of the Sinigang Flip Bowl that I ordered was very fatty and the coke was flat.  The restaurant is small with a single bench table outside and the service is friendly.	3star
Food and service are amazing. Location is pretty good, accessible by train and parking on Water Street. It's a great date spot. You can take a stroll in Brooklyn Bridge Park after if weather permits. There's also Jacques Torres for dessert half a block away. Drink: Tea & Kalamansai is really sweet. A bit too sweet for my palette, but I can see why it's so popular.  Food: Oysters, 6 for $16 is not bad but the oysters were on the small side. I also don't like that the menu and the waiter didn't tell us where the oysters are from. Fortunately, they're briny and not the creamy type.  Beef Tartare was quite good, not the usual where they mix it table side, but it was yummy.  Icelandic Cod was wonderful! Although I thought the mushrooms and the Consomme were a tad too salty. The scallion looks pretty as a whole stalk but makes it kind of annoying to eat. Just saying.  Market Squash & Pomegranate is okay...not much pomegranate. Most of the squash pieces were a bit too al dente for my preference.  The tables around me all ordered the scallops and it smells divine! I must return and try those!	4star
"Re: service only., the worst! Absent minded, "" I don't really know what service is"" attitude, "" I'll get to you when my convo is over"" approach. Don't ever sit at the bar, everything is cooler than you, and my bartender raised the level of incompetence to professional. Will not return. 1 star for the lack of 0."	1star
Horrible service. My friend said he walked out because it took an hour to prepare dinner, and unfortunately my experience was pretty similar. The waiter took my drink order and forgot it. Came back twenty minutes later and asked if we want any drinks. Took close to an hour to deliver the food.  Also the front door was broken and cold air was pouring in. Everyone at my table was wearing heavy winter coats and freezing cold. The waiter thought it was funny that the door latch didn't work. Also he was wearing drop-crotch pants. The food is good but it's not worth the unpleasant environment.	2star
Showed up on Saturday so wasn't able to take advantage of the lunch specials. The atmosphere and service were good...except my wine glass was dirty. It was smeared with some sort of chocolate looking substance. I didn't let it dampen my experience-just used my empty water glass. My bf and I each got the fettuccini with mushrooms and truffle oil-mine with chicken and his with shrimp. It was okay-the chicken was really dry. I wasn't completely thrilled but would come back to try again. Maybe it was just an off day?	3star
"The place looks lovely! I love the decor but the service sucks and I was not impressed with my food.  We went for brunch on a Sunday, sat down at the bar and the first thing the bartender said was that we can't have drinks until 12 pm. She said ""or you guys came to just hang out here? "" I felt like she was judging us a bit because we weren't dressed fancy or looked from that area. About the drinks, as far as I know, the law changed since 2016 and they are allowed to serve alcohol after 10 am... anyway we ordered pancakes and eggs benedict. The pancakes were ok but didn't taste like regular pancakes, I could only eat one because they are very filling and the bread under the eggs was hard as a rock. I think they are trying so hard to make it different/special and it's not working.  They don't have a drink menu and the bartender has no customer service skills.  Too bad, I was really hoping for a nice experience but I didn't enjoy it.  I probably won't return there again"	3star
Few places have gotten 5/5 stars and RHLP desrved and earned its.  I had it at the Coney Island Smorgasburg. Was heavily debating between the cold one with the mayo or the hot one on butter roll. Good lord, I almost died of euphoria. The lobster tasted ridiculously delicious by itself. By the time I bit into the bun, my eyes were rolling back of my head out of a sheer foodgasm. I could eat this forever.  All amazing things you've heard about this place are above and beyond true. Please eat here as part of your foodie expedition.	5star
Very disappointed with this place. Read all the great reviews and had great expectation but left with huge disappointment. My friends and I went there for a girl night. We made reservation for 6pm and arrived at 5:55pm. The host asked if we were going for happy hour or dinner. We said: of course we are so exciting for the happy hour oyster. She sat us down. It took them 10mins to get us water. We ordered oysters, clams and drinks. The waiter took our order. He came back after 5mins and told us oysters and clams are sold out. We then realized there's no oysters on any of the tables. Fine. We went for drinks - mojitos and sangrias. Those drinks are really weak. There's not much alcohols but mostly sweet taste. We ordered the wings and dumplings. They tasted ok but portions are little small. Anyway we found another happy hour place with oysters nearby and decided to leave without ordering any more stuff.  If you want happy hour in mid town, forget about this place. There are plenty of other choices.	1star
"What good Jew wouldn't be lured to a place called Traif?  For those of you not in the know, ""traif"" in Yiddish means foods that aren't Kosher.  So, you say to yourself, then why would an observant Jew come to this place?  Well, an observant Jew most likely wouldn't, but while Jewish, I'm not that observant, and I happen to be lured here by the many, many outstanding reviews for this place....... and being a foodie that resides in Los Angeles, well, I just had to give this place a try when visiting NYC.  I've had my eye on this place for at least a couple of years. Well, now having dined here, it reminded me of that scene in the movie, Chocolat, where Vianne had prepared this amazing birthday dinner feast.  I remember watching her guests as their eyes continuously rolled to the backs of their heads in utter gastronomic bliss.  That's how I felt here.  Every dish was sublime, such unique and wonderful flavors dancing on my tongue, and yes, my eyes would roll to the back of my head with each taste I took.  It was amazing, and I didn't want it to end. What was interesting to me was that I don't normally eat some of the foods that I ate.... like pork belly.  (Did you just gasp?)  No, not because I'm Jewish, but more because I don't like it.  (Okay, I heard you gasp that time.)  But I tried it because if ever I'm going to like it, it'd be here.  While I can safely say it wasn't my favorite dish, I'm still glad I tried it.  As for the list of dishes we dined on, I'll be happy to tell you what we ate, but then, the menu WHEN you decide to go will most likely be different.  It changes frequently, and quite honestly, that's a very cool thing.  To me, it speaks to the chefs' creativity and versatility.  I'm still blown away by the unique combinations of ingredients, herbs, spices, everything. The dishes are on a par with ""small plates,"" but because of the richness of each dish, you will only want small portions, and yet, you will still get full.  Three of us devoured 9 very unique dishes.  They are, in no particular order...... 1.  spicy bigeye tuna tartare, tempura japanese eggplant, kecap manis 2.  baked muenster cheese, smoked chorizo, golden apples, crostini 3.  bbq, braised short rib sliders, sweet potato fries, smoked paprika aioli 4.  sauteed broccoli rabe, portabello mushrooms, truffle toast, fried egg, aged asiago 5.  seared dayboat scallops, snap & english pea risotto, caper-tomato-lemon brown butter 6.  buffalo milk burrata cheese, piquillo pepper romescu sauce, black olive caramel, baguette 7.  Hampshire pork belly, Tippy's black lentils, brown butter apple sauce 8.  icy blue mussels, meyer lemon, sherry, cream, parsley, garlic aioli 9.  parmesan spaetzle, sherried black trumpet mushroom, artichoke alfredo Even just reading that sounds amaaaaazing.  Let me tell you, tasting it is even more so.  Unfortunately, we chose to get dessert elsewhere, which, in retrospect, was a big mistake, given how wonderful the food is here.  Hindsight is amazingly always 20/20.  I knew enough to take a picture of the dessert menu because it looked great, and I wanted a photo to remind me of what we had the chance to eat...... but didn't.  Guess what..... I won't make that mistake again..... but the menu will be different by the time I return.  The good news is, though, I WILL return !!  This was one of my favorite meals EVER.  Gastronomic geniuses at work RIGHT HERE. By the way, the only way to get reservations is either by telephone or email.  They do not take online reservations, such as through Open Table."	5star
"Tucked away in a quiet block is this sleepy gem! If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen! This is one of reward LEGIT THAI restos in NYC! Many Thai places over the years have ""American-ized"" to suit the American palate. But I believe true Thai food should not have to compromise it's identity. This place focuses on food from different regions and uses curry plays and powder, peppercorns, chili's to reflect that properly. Here you won't get glorified spicy sweet pad thai, pad see ewwwww that the average American is used to. Here you get it the way true Thais eat and I loved it for THAT! The wait was 45 minutes on Friday evening at 7:45. So we took a stroll up and down Smith while waiting. We got back at 8:25 and our hostess said or table was paying and would be ready in a row. Perfecto! The tiny restaurant only seats maybe 25 people between its tables and bar seating. While we were waiting folks that walked out seemed happy and had burning mouths! Good sign!!! We were seated and ordered pretty quickly. At first we were worried that food would take forever because two large party tables just sat before us but we were pleasantly surprised. Another plus at the moment is its BYOB. We brought a bottle of bubbles and that complimented the food very well. The Laab Ped Udon (Spicy Duck Salad) was simple with its chunks of duck that were generously dry marinaded with HEAT! There wasn't a whole lot of sauce which led you to believe it wasn't too hot. The cucumbers, cabbage and string beans that it came with were great to scoop up the duck. After two bites the heat started building. The mushroom pineapple curry came just in time.for me to need to quench the fire in my mouth. When I thought the coconut milk in the mushroom pineapple curry would help calm the fire in my mouth it actually added to the fire!!! But the taste..the taste was Oh so amazing between the tofu which soaked up the sweetness of the pineapple and the actual curry sauce being just sweet enough for it to be fragrant but not too sweet!  But as the heat intensified I found table loving it more and more. The Tom Som Plaza Kra Kong (snapper) came just in time before I stuck my whole face in the mushroom pineapple curry and slurped up all that sauce! The snapper was simple but reflective of the basic flavors of ginger and tamarind. This actually helped calm the fire down a bit but it had a more subtle heat. The soup that it came with was clean and refreshing! My mouth was burning up but I still wanted more. When the Kang Ho (northern dry Hung Le and red curry paste with pork shoulder, spare ribs and ming bean noodles) came out, that was a nice finisher. That had some heat too but the sticky rice and pork rinds helped! After having all that and then going back to the spicy duck salad, and rotating all over again between the various dishes, the flavor and spices in these dishes made us almost finish everything!! Normally when I have champagne I get buzzed but with last night's spicy dishes, this was the perfect combo!!!! We def want to go back to try the other dishes soon!!! Stay true to your identity!"	5star
we had dinner last night at Brooklyn star - we ordered the t-bone for 3-4 people and asked for it medium rare and she told us it would take 45 minutes to an hour.  We told her we were ok for rare also and she said it would still take an 45 minutes or so.  So we ordered appetizers and waited patiently - the apps were great (mac and cheese and wings) however the meat came and it was cold! even the grease on it was cold - We eat and prepare rare meat all the time  - and the inside is never hot but the outside should be seared and served hot for sure -  really ruined the experience for me - and it was super expensive !	2star
The server Aaron was very nice and attentive. He was always super polite and the food was super fresh. The catfish was very flavorful and the mac and cheese was very cheesy and good. There was so much mac and cheese you could take it home.	4star
Wonderful drinks but beware of being overcharged. The woman behind the bar tried to take my credit card before giving me the check and was annoyed I insisted on seeing the bill first. When I got the bill, I had been charged for a drink I never ordered and did not receive.  Coincidence?  I think not.	1star
"Avoid this place at all costs if you're coming in with a group.  This place pretty much robbed us in ""automatic gratuity"". We came with a group of 9 people. It was late at night, there wasn't that much people yet the servers barely attended to us. Our waters were hardly ever filled. I shared a kimchi and calamari pancake and I can tell you it was a complete rip off. There was no calamari what so ever and the kimchi was just cabbage, there was no spice to it at all. The pancake was soggy and tasteless. I would've complained more to the servers or the chef but since it was my friend's birthday I didn't want to cause any disruptions. While I sucked it up and ate my horrible meal, the real nightmare began when the check came. The server told us he automatically added 20% gratuity to our check and they only take a MAXIMUM of FOUR CREDIT CARDS.  First of all, who the hell takes only 4 credit cards at a time?  Second of all, would it kill you to do separate checks? Oh let me guess, you're too lazy and you won't be able to apply your automatic 20% tip since the checks will say one order for 1 person instead of the entire group of 9.  Third, you have a lot of freakin' nerve to charge 20% tip for crappy service.  Clearly Kori has no idea how to handle large groups thanks to this tormented experience I will never stop foot in here nor will I ever recommend this place to anyone else."	1star
2.5 Stars, but I will give you the benefit of the doubt... Their food is decent, I have had to send things back but they were corrected. The staff is nice, never had an issue there. The real reason this place aggravates me is they do no accept credit cards. Come on AlMar, you are a large, full service restaurant their is no excuse why you should not accept plastic, its RIDICULOUS!! It just seems arrogant.. Dumbo is in such need of restaurant competition, this is why these places are still pulling crap like this, because they know there are very limited options for sit down restaurants. Its a decent spot just make sure you have cash in hand..	3star
I visited a ton of food spots during my time in NY and this place definitely stood out! It's a nicer, tapa-style restaurant where you order a number of small plates to share among friends. My boyfriend and I split 4-5 plates between ourselves and were stuffed. Some dishes to note were: - Strawberry BBQ ribs: fall-off-the-bone tender and sooo good but slightly too sweet for me. - Surf n Turf: pork belly and crab were both extremely tender and surprisingly went really well together with the polenta. This dish was probably my favorite. Flavors were subtle and great. - Spicy Tuna Tartare: I didn't think I'd enjoy the eggplant but I definitely did! One dish that neither of us were fans of were the sauteed sweetbread. It was like a mushy chicken tender and we couldn't make ourselves finish it. Food didn't take too long to come out at all and service was very attentive. Definitely a must-eat spot in Brooklyn!	5star
Delicious meats and cuts but wish they had better sides. I think for the wait and price it's worth it to prob just order for takeout and bring it home to eat with your own personal fave sides wththe delish thick cut meat.  The bacon was good I'd order it again if given the chance but I think I'll skip the fries and spinach.	4star
Came for an early lunch since they open at 11 and our usual spot opens an hour later.  It was a super hot day and I walked in with some water in a cup I was drinking while walking there (I'm also pregnant) and they told me no outside food or drinks allowed and the hostess chucked my cup of water.  Found that unusual not like it was a can of soda.  Anyhow, the ramen came quickly.  I forgot the name of the one I got but the portion was good.  It seemed bigger than my husband's.  $16 without an egg is a little pricey compared to Toronto ramen but my husband says that's NYC for you.	4star
Hands down the best greek seafood outside of Greece. Very fresh reasonable price, highly recommend everything! Just the wait can be long 1 hr, so be aware. Make sure you put your name on the list right away.	5star
We went here for dinner on a Friday evening. The place is pretty crude on the outside, but cosy in the inside. We have absolutely no complaints: the food was delicious, service was great and we even got a round of whiskey shots on the house. Easy 5/5.	5star
"**Update** I was invited back for a complementary lunch because of my prior experience - and this was a completely different mealsperience (new word). Patience.  I had been trading e-mails back and forth with one of the managers in the restaurant trying to pick a day I could come in for lunch.  Given an ever-changing work schedule, I think I switched my day 3 or 4 times over the course of the last 3 weeks.  Today's lunch worked out nicely for both my girlfriend and I, and we got a nice booth by the window that had a ""reserved"" sign on it. Foods.  After we decided what we wanted & ordered, we were given the meatballs, complements of the chef.  Delicious - would definitely order these again.  I got the spinach salad, sub feta for bleu, and my girlfriend got the steak sandwich.  The steak on my salad was the perfect amount of rare, the salad itself was delicious, and the sandwich got rave reviews from across the booth.  All three items would be ordered again.  Now i'm curious about the rest of the menu... Had this not been during the middle of a workday, a cold beer would have gone really well with the food...so next time, we need to come after work or on a day that we are both taking off. Staff.  Our drinks never got below 1/4 before they were refilled, and the chef (same guy from the first time) came out twice to meet us and make sure everything was excellent.  I don't even think we had to ask for anything the whole time we were there.  He even offered dessert, but by that time we were absolutely stuffed.  Next time, most definitely! It is nice to know that they care enough about their restaurant and their food to invite me back.  My office likes to do lunch and they like to try new places...so next time i'll push them all here.  My office also likes to drink after work and the ""pour your own beer"" room downstairs for events and parties seems right up our alley."	4star
I went here after work for a quick dinner. Its a bit of a maze to get around in to get to the restaurants, but its a nice overwhelming. Its a bunch of markets downstairs with all the Italian food you could dream of, including a nutella bar.  We went up to the roof to Biata for dinner. It had a loud and busy vibe. It still had all of the Christmas decorations up so it was beautiful. The waiter was a little overwhelmed so the service was eh, but the food was great. We had the lasagna and the 5 cheese plate.  The beer and wine selection was also way more impressive than I was expecting. I would definitely return for a few drinks with friends as well as dinner again.	4star
Plus side the host was really nice and friendly. Food was ok. Went there during the festival and it was really crowded. There was one waitress handling I think at least 4 tables , two of the tables had at least 8 people.  I think she did the best she could.   Had to wait a long time for breadsticks which were dry .  If you want more it's an additional 2.50.  Had to wait a long time to get the check at least 15 min.  Had to wait a long time to get the credit card back.	3star
The service is very bad. The receptionists, Kaisha and the other girl, they are not professional.  They don't help the customers and they really offer a bad service.  In the last year the quality of the Boathouse's service decreased of the 100% because the staff is really bad. Before there was a good service, but honestly in the last year is the worst. They never answer to the phone when you need to make a reservation, they never reply to emails and when finally you can make the reservation, you must deal with a very unprofessional team. The worst are the two receptionists, followed by the waiters...	1star
I'll be honest..I came here for the interior decor, which was great, but the food and service also delivered!  The menu is expansive which I don't always recommend but the server explained the different sections --more traditional Thai street food to chef created specialities locally sourced  The service staff all worked together and were very friendly.  One pitfall was that I felt there was only one dessert that was more on the traditional Thai side..the Thai medley. Oh the other hand, it was very good.  I hope to come back and try the many other things on their menu	5star
"THE RUDE UNPROFESSIONAL MANAGER We were so excited to try this restaurant and unfortunately had such an AWFUL EXPERIENCE at the end of the evening that we will NEVER RETURN.   We booked a 7:15 PM reservation for 5 adults.  Three of us arrived on time.  My son and I went into the restaurant while my husband looked for parking (not easy to find) and ordered a cocktail.  The bartender was delightful!   The manager came over to us so I explained that my husband was searching for parking and our daughter and son in law were delayed by the traffic and rain from Tribeca but would be there within 10 minutes.  The manager said, ""Fine, but we'll need your table before 9:30 PM because we have another reservation coming in"".  Of course we understood and promised we would not ""linger"" and delay dinner for the next party.   We were all there and seated by 7:30 PM (15 minutes past our reservation time).  This was a special family dinner for us since we had not all been together in about 3 months.   We enjoyed trying all the different dishes .  Although not authentic (I'm Indonesian and I come from a long line of Indonesian chefs)  we certainly had fun and thought that the dishes were well presented and tasty.  The cuisine is more a ""fusion"" of Vietnamese/Indonesian but even so, the dishes were executed well.  Our server was just as delightful as the bartender.   The only person that would glare at us from time to time was the manager.   Well before 9:30 PM, we settled the check.  It was $350 before the gratuity.  We paid in cash.  Within a minute, the RUDE LITTLE MALE MANAGER came over and said, ""the restaurant does not accept HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.""  We were confused as there were NO SIGNS anywhere (not even printed on the menu) that hundred dollar bills/cash was not accepted within the restaurant.  We were all stunned...REALLY? Whoever heard of a restaurant in Brooklyn or NYC that doesn't accept cash?  We yanked out the AMEX card and paid our bill.   Our son who is in the hospitality industry decided to speak quietly to the manager at the back of the restaurant about the ""no cash"" policy.  It was quite obvious from the manager's  nasty attitude, that he had decided (in his feeble little brain) that we must have printed the bills up in the car before walking into ""HIS"" restaurant.  He got quite belligerent and dismissive with our son.   I have to admit, at that point I became quite irritated with his hideous attitude. I told him we did not appreciate his rudeness and he should not be treating customers in that way.  His response, ""GET OUT OF MY RESTAURANT""!  As he was closing  the door behind me I proceeded to call him every name that fit! Sadly,  I'm sure this is not the first time this ridiculously, unprofessional, service person has behaved badly toward this restaurant's clientele.   The question is, WHY DOES THE CHEF HAVE THIS NASTY GUY AS HIS FRONT PERSON?   Is business so robust and brisk that he does not care about customers?   PLUS, if you have a policy of ""NO CASH"", POST IT!!!!!!   So, is Selamat Pagi worth the trip?  NO. We will certainly NEVER RECOMMEND it!"	1star
Just revisited my favorite pizza place and it's not the amazing pizza I remembered it to be. It has definitely changed over the years, or more and better pizza places have popped up to compete with them. Don't get me wrong, my friend and I still inhaled the pizza because we were starving and all the ingredients tasted fresh and delicious. We ordered a red sauce pizza with meatballs, mushrooms and olives. The meatballs were really good. A few too many olives on there and they were super salty. Didn't see a trace of the basil that was supposed to be on there. The crust has changed too, it's not the amazing crust it used to be. We went on a Friday afternoon and waited in line about 20 minutes, so it wasn't terrible. And by the way, it's cash only.	4star
The waiter was the nicest surfer ever! Five stars for him. The food was just not good though. They have a sauce situation. The pairings are all wrong ! It was weird.	2star
"Pluses include: - Dope looking place (they must have poured serious coin into this joint) - Complimentary still AND sparkling water bottles with ""endless"" refills (which would be cool, if the sparkling didn't turn flat so quickly) - Complimentary bread and butter (butter is solid, bread would be good if it wasn't 7-seconds away from being completely stale) - The mac & cheese is as advertised and reported by fellow Yelpers, and generously portioned Quasi-negatives include: - The tomato soup with cheese melt was overly salty and the ""French onion"" style to this dish was a bit odd - The battered cod sandwich, with house potato chips, while decent, was too heavy on the oil and too light on the dressing Full on negative is one: - The prices ... they are ridiculously high for the type of restaurant and the food they serve (and anyone that reads my reviews knows that I rarely, if ever, comment on pricing)"	3star
"Bottom line: Beautiful views and gardens, impeccable table service, host service not so good. Food items were Bs or Cs. Went here for our anniversary & had pre requested a window seat. When we arrived, we weren't seated at a window. When i pointed that out to the maitre de or whoever he was, he said ""yeah well, everyone does."" Whats up with the sass??? Not a good first impression of service. Service was definitely made up table-side as wait staff is attentive to your needs & dietary restrictions. They were on their A game with crumbing the table, removing plates on time, refilling waters, etc.  Food: smoked salmon appetizer was ok & octopus appetizer was pretty good. For mains, I got the mushroom Wellington which was recommended by other Yelpers but it's simply puff pastry stuffed with mushroom and nothing else exciting is going on. Comes with a side of bland steamed vegetables. Husband got the lamb and said it was done well but seemed like it was only salted and even then, very bland. Nothing mind blowing. Dessert is dessert and can't go too wrong. I enjoyed their blueberry tartlet with coffee and the brooklyn bridge dessert was cute!  It's definitely a lovely date spot with live piano and formal dining but if you are looking for fine dining options in NYC mainly for food and sophisticated palate stimulation, don't go here. That said, we were charmed by the ambience, piano player, and I have a special connection with Brooklyn Heights and the so the night was great"	3star
I'm not particularly happy with all of my low-star reviews lately...maybe I've just run into a streak of bad luck. I went with four of my coworkers to Gallito's with high hopes, since I went a few months back and it was fine. Today was far from it. I attempted to order a torta and was told they had no bread. Really?! It's 1:30 and you're out of bread to make sandwiches? Insanity. I ended up ordering the tortilla soup and a taco. We ordered at 1:30. By 1:55, nothing had come out to any of us, despite the waiter saying they'd bring the soups out first. My friend asked where the soups were and was told everything was coming out at once. When he mentioned we were told it would come out first, the waiter 1) Rudely mocked him, and then 2) Said they only had one cook, and tough luck. So, bad service. The soups finally came out after nearly THIRTY minutes of waiting, because ladeling something into a bowl is a real challenge. Black bean soup was good, but the tortilla soup, which I got, was terribly bland. At 2:15, my taco came. For those bad at calculating times, that's 40 minutes from ordering to getting a single taco. It was pretty good, but not worth the wait by a mile. I was going to give them three stars, but when we got our check, gratuity was INCLUDED. No, you do not deserve an 18% tip for piss-poor service and a rude waitstaff. I will not be going back.	2star
I cry when I think about the fact that I can't eat the tie- dye pizza every day. This pizza is absolutely amazingggggg. The crust is perfect and the flavors are phenomenal. This is probably my favorite pizza that I have had in the city- and I eat a lot of pizza. Love the vibes of the restaurant.. it is small so you will probably have to wait if you don't have a reservation. Definitely worth the wait	5star

I'd had Caracas bookmarked for years, but it turned out to be overrated, overpriced, and underwhelming. I ordered the Yo-yo appetizer, which should actually be under the dessert category, the Hot Queen (made of pulled chicken, peppers, onions, mayo, avocado), and the Da Pabellon (shredded beef, beans, cheese, plantains). The arepas were small and ALRIGHT. The former was overtaken by the avocado, and the latter was pretty salty. One is not enough per person, and these arepas are not cheap. ~$10 for each one, which are the size of my fist, is kinda unacceptable. Place is abnormally small, so you may have a wait. For a party of two, we waited fifteen minutes outside and ended up sitting at the bar.	2star
Cute place with wonderful service and average food.  The food: -Shrimp salad: pretty good, better without the dressing, or less of it, wasn't really worth the price -Kale salad: the kale wasn't chopped small enough, extremely difficult to eat -Steak salad: good portion of steak but it was too overdone -Spinach salad: best salad out of the bunch, loved the pecans -Vongole pasta: average, wasn't too flavorful -Salciccia pasta: probably the best thing on the menu that we tried, rigatoni was perfectly done and the sausage was delicious -Gamberi pasta: pretty good, broccoli was really bitter though -Mint lemonade: extremely sour (others who tried it hated it, but I actually liked it)	3star
Really really expensive for the quality you get. Entrees average $17-$25 for tacos, enchiladas, burritos etc. and don't even get me started on the 'special' burritos that run $35 ...for a burrito!!! The drinks at happy hour are $6 beers and $10 margs - definitely not a great deal. I can only imagine what full price is.. Lastly, the decor is pretty bad - given how much I'm paying, I feel like they can do better Overall, I don't think I'll return	2star
I visited Buddakan Saturday night with my friend, her husband and his friend visiting from Australia. We arrived on time for our rezzie but our table wasn't quite ready so we sat in the lounge area for a round of drinks. The hostesses were very gracious and efficient. The lounge was really nice, dark and set the mood.  I started with a drink that had blackberry and prosecco. It was a little too sweet for me, a little cough syruppy.  Once sat, ordered almost all of the apps twice. They were really good. The rock shrimp and edamame dumplings were favorites at the table. Our server was great. He had great timing. I also tried a drink that was served on the rocks I think with carrot juice? This was okay, also a little too sweet. The food was great. However, I didn't love the cocktails and the bartenders didn't seem to know or have the ingredients for many classic cocktails. I'm usually okay with this because I enjoy trying signature drinks but the drinks here weren't the most well balanced. Overall, it was very enjoyable and I would go back.	4star
It is a small place, if you didn't live in or near Gowanus, you'd probably miss out on this gem! The food is incredible - extremely flavorful and fresh. Defintely stop by to get the best Cuban food in NYC!	5star
Been here few years ago. Enjoy the lobster meal. But past year there lobster have been a little smaller. You may order a larger one , and paid a little more.  There's always a line outside. At least 45 min. Wait.  I'll still come back, but not as often as I use too.	4star
"I ordered Risotto Cheeseballs, Filet Mignon and Seafood Pasta. The only thing good about the store was its decor. The staff were nice, but weren't properly trained; the waiter didn't even ask how to cook my steak. The food was horrendous. Cheeseballs were okay, but served with salad dressing for some reason. The pasta had no taste. The steak 'looked' medium-rare, but tasted like rubber. The cherry on the top was the stone plate for steak. I want to ask the owner, ""just why??"" The knife literally grades against the stone and sauce spills everywhere on the table. If it wasn't for the decor the place deserves a 1 star. Definitely not on my come-back list."	2star
For the price we paid, the food is way too little. 8 bucks for 9 pieces calamari and it doesn't even taste good. The flour coating is way too thick. We ordered crispy chicken, and fries as well. The fries was fine. One little piece of short ribs was 15 bucks, not worth it. For the price, there's definitely better options out there for better taste.	2star
Hands down best fried dumplings I've ever had. Make sure to add the sweet vinegar and chili sauce! Also beef brisket noodles were amazing - I wasn't dying of thirst so I'm assuming there wasn't too much MSG! Meat/broth/noodle ratio was on point :) Came in around 1:30 on a Saturday and managed to find a seat! 2 beef brisket soups + 1 fried dumplings = $16	5star
Despite of not being very hungry when we finished our broadway show, I still found myself voraciously enjoying carmine's delicious pasta. We came 30 min prior to closing but they still allowed us in. We felt a bit rushed during the meal, but the food was soooo good. Everything is family style here. That means everything is HUGE. Hence the price. Each entre is literally enough to feed 4 hungry people. We ordered the clam angel hair pasta  with white sauce and it was delicious! The clam tasted fresh and tender and the pasta was cooked perfectly! I dare say one of the most perfectly cooked el dente I've had in a while. Carmine is definitely worth a visit before or after your theatre visit. Better yet, come with a group of hungry friends and you'll be sure to have an economical feast!	4star
this place is absolutely beautiful. its a tiny little spot but with so much charm ! there are little terrariums hanging from the ceiling. everything we ordered was delicious and the staff were very endearing. the tabasco honey for the wings was so flavorful. the short rib meat loaf melted in my mouth the potatoes included in the short rib dish had some sweet sauce that made it mind-blowing. Arnold Palmer was perfect to wash everything down. i wish it wasn't 5$ though.	5star
Came here after a long day of moving into my new apartment in Astoria! I think we came on an off day and time (lunch on Thursday at 3:45 PM, anyone?) so we were seated right away. I was with my Chinese-speaking family, so communicating and ordering with the wait staff was easy and enjoyable. I'm not sure if my experience would have changed were I not with my family, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt (they even asked to what family we had left in China/Taiwan, what they were up to... Chinese culture, y'all).  We ordered our food, getting a shacha (Asian sauce) beef stir fry noodles, beef noodle soup, beef-green onion pancake roll, steamed char siu buns and a couple of soup dumpling orders to split in our party of four. Our orders actually took longer than expected, for there not being that many people in the restaurant but everything was solid and pretty authentic. I really liked the soup dumplings, get the pork and cabbage ones!! Probably some of the best I've had in New York. Unfortunately, they did forget the char siu buns that we'd ordered so we were left sitting at the end of our meal waiting for the buns... I think we waited about 15 minutes before my dad gave up and asked for the check. They asked if we wanted to wait a little bit and have the buns boxed and we could take them to go, but we declined. Overall good eating experience though, I'd go again if I were in Flushing but wouldn't make the long af trip out to Flushing to go again. Would recommend to anyone looking for Nan Xiang food (or authentic Chinese) in Flushing!	4star
I haven't had a meal this bad in a very long time. What we had was just yuck. We came here because of the good yelp reviews  We had the fried chicken drumsticks with soy garlic sauce. It was really really really bad. It was old, over fried, with tons of tendons inside and very not fresh. The meat in the fried chicken was actually black! I took a few bites and had to stop because it was just disgusting. They should never ever serve food like that to any human being  I also ordered the yukaejiang, which is spicy beef soup. That was flavorless and the beef had a stinky beef taste. Just not good.  My husband ordered the veggie kimbap which was the best part of the meal  Overall,  will never return again	1star
"Had a 8pm reservation and arrive a tad last 15 minutes over my time and was scolded by a hostess named Lizzy to make sure I call if I am going to be late . Ok, thank you for the lecture . My bad . Then she tells us to wait while she gets our ""table "" ready .. So we waited and was led to our ""table"" which was a tiny table by their walk in bar area that any guests can use without any reservation.  First come first serve.  I am not sure why she couldn't be honest and just said after her lecture to a paying customer that there isn't any tables left BC I was late?  BC if she said there is no table left we would have just walked out and eaten at any other 1000 Manhattan restaurants.  She lectured, made me wait , just to seat me at their very open ""walk in anytime "" bar area table? LOL!    I was a party of 3 and really needed a bigger table but Lizzy was very uptight about reseating us and acted like she did us a big favor by giving us another bigger ""bar area , walk in anytime table"" table after we ordered a bottle of wine. Truthfully, we could have just easily moved and went to sit at the empty bar and just eaten there minus the hostess' power trip. Maybe she had a bad meal there. We proceeded to order dinner .. Since we were celebrating. Ordered fried artichoke, spaghetti with clams, warm fig salad as entree. Spaghetti was very salty and very average.  It was al dente and was not horrid but was nothing special . Other two appetizers were average . Entrees were the chicken, the carbonara and the oxtail. Again, so average that there really isn't anything to mention.  Service was just ok. Very slow. Tip is included so don't expect any hustle for you . We told Lizzy the hostess that we were there to celebrate an occasion and she told us she will take care of us but -- nothing happened. No candles on our tiramisu dessert.   Needless to say, service is NOT their strong game.  If you want the farm table Italian fun atmosphere , save your money ($40 for two chicken breast here) and go to Il Buco downtown: MUCH better food and the crowd is not 1/2 tourist and you won't get a disingenuous hostess . Their bread was awesome though, and great olive oil for the bread."	2star
I think this place is literally just A-OK. I ordered chicken & waffles with sausage gravy. It was just a little disappointing to be quite honest! The chicken was pretty dry, and so were the waffles!! It was like the waffles were a little too overdone.  I might come again to try other dishes because this place is very cute. Small interior with nice decor.  Definitely do come here and try this place for yourself, but maybe skip out on the chicken and waffles. (Queens Comfort which is literally down the block has better chicken and waffles)	3star
The best steakhouse in nyc!!!!! What you need is to book a table in advance. Let's say about a month in advance. I love the steak and bacon here. I would say Peter Luger is the place that i would like all my visiting friends to visit at least once in a lifetime!	5star
The food was really amazing and I cannot fault it. However, I left with a bitter taste in my mouth after I was talked into getting a pitcher of beer with '4-5 pints' (for the price of 4 pints - so no saving, which I pointed out to the server). Some time passes and my friend and I manage to squeeze 3 and a bit pints out of this pitcher. Feeling very much deceived, we mention it and the waiter brings us another pitcher and two (free) shots. At the end of the night we are charged full price for two pitchers (after complaining)... Go and eat the food - it's really awesome but do yourself a favor and don't order a pitcher of beer! They're banking on you drinking it in dribs and drabs and not realizing that you're not getting what's been advertised to you. It's not a good way to conduct business in an otherwise good establishment.	2star
"We really wanted to love this place as we live in the hood.  Unfortunately, it was an epic fail.  The outdoor space was cool and the kale caesar salad and mashed yucca was pretty good. However, I ordered the skirt steak (medium) and about 45 minutes later, I was presented with a rib eye steak very well done (super chewy and dry).  The waiter only told me as he placed the rib eye in front of me that they were out of the skirt steak! I would have liked to have had a choice especially since the rib eye totally sucked. The waiter ""tried to make good"" by offering to charge us the skirt steak price (a mere $3 less) and then proceeded to let us know how good the skirt steak tasted when he had it the night before. Thanks dude. We won't be back."	2star
I had high expectations for this place seeing all the 5 star reviews.  The interior was very nice very clean and cute place.  For appetizer I ordered the crab cake special and it came out totally unexpected for a crab cake to look.  It was just very small pieces of crab.  I didn't care for it at all.  My friend had the onion soup for appetizer  and chicken dinner and thought it was just average.  I had the branzino dish over risotto which I thought was good.  For dessert I ordered the the lava cake with vanilla ice cream,  but I was served a chocolate cake with no ice cream.  I asked the server why am I being served chocolate cake instead of lava cake that I ordered,  and he said this is the lava cake here.  Really didn't make sense.  The chocolate cake was good,  but not what I ordered or expected to be served.  Overall the food was decent, but no wow factor.	3star
Holy cow what a great find in a desert of crummy restaurants in the theatre district in NYC. I had spaghetti carbonara which as a result of eating it there is now one of my favorite Italian dishes! Will go again.  Tricolori isn't the finest of fine dining establishments. They do give a well prepared meal in a clean, attractive environment at a good price.	5star
I have been meaning to try out Burger & Lobster (Chelsea location) for two weeks and learned that they opened this one near my work so I was looking forward to finally getting my hands on their lobster roll. Tucked away in Times Square, this is a good place to grab relatively casual dinner in a nice clean setting with an upscale feel (minus the hanging cardboard lobster claws in main dining area). When I first arrived there, I was disheartened that the person at the front stopped me from going in to join my 3 friends who were there and made a big deal that the table they were sitting at did not allow for a fourth person. When I asked him if there were any other space, and if not, we can just go to the bar but he did not seem to even try. When I got to the table where my friends were sitting at, two servers came and helped me settle down which was nice though the table was a bit crowded for four. My friends also mentioned that the front desk person made a big deal about how there's not enough space for a party of four, but it wasn't even that crowded.  As for the food, I got the original chilled lobster roll and it was filling but it didn't have much flavor. The fries were also disappointingly soggy. Meal was decent, but I wouldn't be excited to come back here for a second time.	3star
I wanted to LOVE this place, instead I only LIKE it.  Here is the scoop, we did not have reservations but they were not packed by any means.  The man at the door told us he would have to ask his manager if we could get a table.... uh, why?  There were many tables open.  After ordering the apps, the waiter took our eating utensils and set them  on the table.  They were covered in food.  I was grossed out.  If I wanted to lick the table, I didn't need the servers help.   All in all, the food was extremely tasty.  Well prepared and full of flavor.  I love how the restaurant is set up and the ambiance it exudes.  It is clean and obviously well loved by the community.   My only suggestion is that the wait staff learn proper serving etiquette.  I do t expect to be served on one side and dirty plates to be removed from the other side, but I do expect to not have my reusable eating utensils placed directly on the table top.  Definitely check this place out, but don't expect miracles.	3star
The ambiance and food was generally good. I enjoyed it although the wait for the food took quite some time. The portions were not as big as I pictured but the bread with oil and vinegar was good!	3star
Decided to dine here with my parents on Mother's day after reading many good reviews about the restaurant. It doesn't feel like a restaurant that would be located in Chinatown. The place definitely gives off a vibrant feeling due to all the plants surrounding you. The service is wonderful. The waiter is very attentive. I notice the manager/the boss always walking around as well to check in on the customers.  I ordered the following: Salad Nicoise Eggplant Parmesan Seafood Paella Creme brulee The food was pretty good. Our only disappointment was the main course: Seafood Paella. Everything about the Seafood Paella is good except for the fact that they didn't clean the clams and mussels thoroughly. It was a rookie move of the kitchen staff. I can hear the sound of myself crunching onto the gritty clam and mussel.  Overall 3 stars but I'll revisit soon.	3star
I'm in love with their ramen. I've tried many different ramen spots in the city (totto, Ivan, Ippuedo, Minca, and the list continues on ....) but Mu Ramen has captured the top spot of the list. Their broth is light and delicious. I tried the tonkatsu ramen and IT WAS AN INSTANCE ASCEND TO HEAVEN. I didn't try the chicken wings because $8/wing is SO expensive.  I hate how their tables are set up, makes it hard to have a good conversation with your friends.	5star
A hole in the wall I would like to live in. We got the fried chicken dumplings which had a crunch but smoothieness from the wrapping. Douse everything in the plastic bottle sauce, it makes it even better. We also got the chicken pan noodles which were accompanied by a kids pair of scissors. We cut the noodles with the scissors but were not sure. We weren't hungry but finished the entire meal, that's how you know it's a 5 star rating.	5star
Pretty underwhelming.... Thought I'd check this place out as it seems pretty busy every time I walked by. I got the chili ramen and it was very disappointing. The broth has no depth or character - just tastes like salty water? The temp was lukewarm - pretty much just slightly above room temp (not the piping hot temp that ramen is usually served at). I couldn't tell if the egg was meant to be boiled through or soft boiled. The pork was OK, but only one small piece. Probably wouldn't come back again, and most likely will satiate my ramen cravings at other joints throughout the city.	3star
"This was it. The big one. My first foray into a Michelin Star restaurant. So I thought I would dip my toes in slowly and start off with a highly recommended 1 star - The Gotham Bar and grill.  Whilst visiting friends in New York and being a Texas boy, I thought it would be an experience to finally dine at a Michelin Star restaurant. For the most part, the Gotham was amazing. Our party was seated right away thanks to our handy reservations courtesy of our friends we were staying with. The atmosphere was delightful. You could hear the whims of conversation taking place over drinks, but it wasn't so loud it was deafening. The host slid the table out so the lovely wife and accompanying friend could adjourn to a comfortable bench. The table was then slid into comfortable range of the ladies so the men could sit down. Now, my wife while wearing a black dress was forced to use a white napkin. This would certainly be a food critics niggle, but she brushed it off. I was a little discerned as I have eaten at far lesser restaurants that offer both napkin choices for the corresponding attire.  Our party was eager to get to the mains. So we ordered 2 starters for the table to share. The Yellowfin Tuna Tartare...so sweet, so fresh, so delectably gentile, subtle, and explosive all at once...it was every bite amazing. We wished we had ordered 3-4 of these it was that good. However, the Tartare was slightly overshadowed by one of my guilty pleasures, Wild Mushroom and Foie Gras Terrine. Yes. I like fatty liver. Yes I know there will be some ecomentalist or PETA member (which I am a member of, People Eating Tasty Animals) blithering on about how cruel it is blah blah...droning...annoying hipster voices...sorry...lost it there for a sec.  I don't care. It tastes good. Damn good. I hunt, skin, clean, and consume my own forages in the form of wild game. Fatty Liver? Delicious. And this was no exception. So soft cutting it with a knife seemed insulting. So deliciously satisfying I smirked, until I smiled, until I exclaimed...""Damn this is good."" And brioche...well...enough said as it is brioche.  Then out came the mains. The loving wife and her best friend ordered the Thai Spiced Maine Lobster. Which was amazing. Perfectly cooked lobster with amazing presentation. The Thai spiced noodles were softy, just slightly softer than al dente, and delectable. The other male companion in the group ordered the Rack of Lamb, which was superb. Soft, juicy, flavorful little riblets which, when split into individual lollipops revealed they were perfectly cooked and seasoned. Truly a treat in which I wish I had partaken. I went for the daddy...the 28 Day Dry Aged New York Steak.  Never meet your heros. As noted earlier, I hail from Texas currently. I have had many a bovine critter on my plate if you know what I mean. Some of which were mooing that morning. I am also a home gastronomist and have put hours upon hours of practice into perfecting the judicious application of heat and seasoning to bovine parts. The steak here was good-ish. You could taste the age and it was cooked about as perfectly perfect as cooked perfect steak gets, but that was about it. The beefiness was far overshadowed by the char on the outside, which was borderline all you could taste. It seemed there was no seasoning at all on the steak. The char flavor permeated the through the meat so much the aged steak flavor I so was so wantonly desperate for was all but gone. Top it off with a bordelaise that also had an air of burnt char only compounding the meat masking flavors. I continued to eat the steak, not wanting to send a Michelin dish back. The onion rings that accompanied the steak were sweet, but bland. Salt could have saved these as well. But the rings like the meat seemed un-seasoned after so much care was taken to perfectly fry them. The root vege that came with the dish was delicious as was the mustard custard. The steak though...just a miss this evening.  We did take a recommendation from the house sommelier and paired our meals with a lovely bottle of red. Excellent recommendation on their part.  The after-dinner cappuccino's were delightful, tasty, and a filling way to end the evening.  In summary, this evening was like driving a Lamborghini Countach. Damn near EVERYTHING is perfect...the presentation, the way it looks, the way the scissor doors slide open, the touch of the steering wheel, the smell of the Italian leather, almost perfect...except for the one thing you actually wanted it to do...be fun to drive...while the remainder of the experience is epic...you can't help but feel a little gutted. Which is not to say I would EVER dissuade someone from eating here. Really. The place is magnificent. Just don't get the steak. And never meet your heros."	3star
We had a great dinner here on a quiet Wednesday night.  Our waiter (Max) was outstanding, and listened to our food and drink preferences before giving us recommendations.  The Plantains and the Cuban Sandwich Spring Rolls were outstanding.  Beautiful place with a nice (and quiet!!, finally a quiet place in Chelsea!) atmosphere.  Looks like a great place for happy hour as well, super nice bar.  Will definitely be back soon!!	5star
"The staff was friendly and welcoming, the decor is a bit confusing a mix between modern, classic Italian, and NYC but just not quite right.     I orders the Chicken Italian sausage grilled in garlic and herbs servers with mix veggies. The dish was good, nothing to write home about.  The sauce was ""tangy"" and I didn't really even taste Rosemary which was a disappointment.  The portion was a fair size definitely didn't fill me up.  So I would recommend a starter soup salad if you are hungry  Dinner also comes with warm bread, nothing great or bad just bread.   Overall it was very mediocre.  Not to say I would avoid the place just very under whelming"	3star
Nice area inside but I wasn't too impressed with the fresh hand made pasta. Came here with my fiancé and we both were not wowed. Surprised other people like it so much.	3star
I started off the meal with the Chili soy wings. They remind me of Korean Fried chicken by the way they are fried but the sauce is somewhat different. They were good - would order again. 3.5/5 Following the wings, I ordered the soy ramen with roasted pork. I had such high expectations for this ramen because of the good reviews but was pretty disappointed. I could not taste the soy flavor at all and the broth tasted somewhat fishy to me. After adding some Chili's into the broth, it was more enjoyable. The pork was very, very fatty but tender. I do think it's one of the better protein options offered with ramen here. Hopefully, the miso broth is better. 2.5/5	3star
Great location if you are going to The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Dated decor that's cozy, a good meal and very good service. The manager came over to check with one of our friends to be sure that modifications to an order would result in enjoyable food. Pricey for modest salads (though all tasty).The molten chocolate cake was disappointing.	3star
Came here because I heard soo much about their lobster rolls. The place itself is soo small, we sat at the bar and ordered drinks which were very expensive. The lobster rolls took a while to come out and when it did the fries were cold and the roll tasted bland. I had to add a lil salt to my food. Overall not my type of place. I wont be back.	3star
This bar has a fun diner-y vibe, but it's not a good place to linger.  We sat at the bar and the bartender wanted us to move along after we were done with our drinks.   This is a good little nook to crash in if you're in Chelsea and don't want to traipse very far to find the next bar.  There's also a cute donut shop next door if you're in need of a sweet treat after the alcohol! The cocktail that I tried had a great smokey taste!  An interesting aftertaste for a berry flavored cocktail, for sure.	3star
"OK, so I finally made it back (in person this time) and a great meal, this is really more of a 3 1/2 star rating. The food is solid, but the cocktails are freakin amazing. The No Name (mezcal, jalapeno, lime) and the Hells Hundred (bourbon, ginger beer, cayenne) are strong choices. I don't even like bourbon, and while the ginger beer did take center stage there was enough whiskey in there to taste it, it was just very well balanced. Anthony and the brunette lady working the bar were both fantastic.  I ordered the mussels again and this time was not disappointed. The broth was on point and the mussels were cooked perfectly. The grilled calamari salad was great. The ""mozz chips"" (fried breaded mozzarella) are fine if you're looking for something deep fried, but there are stronger choices on the menu. Like the baked clams, for instance. The star was definitely the Gamberi: rigatoni, shrimp, and broccoli in a pink sauce. YES. This was done freakin right, and it's what I'd order if I found myself here again.  I came on a Friday night and once a certain hour hits the place gets sort of...clubby? Loud house music, people lining up just for the bar and not ordering food. Like I said, the cocktails are certainly strong enough to stand on their own but I can see wanting to cut out earlier if that's not the atmosphere you want."	3star
It's been a several months since the last time I had dined at Taverna - it's still as good as it was then! This time we ordered the Mediterranean bass, the swordfish & salmon steak - everything was so well cooked & flavored. We left full and extremely satisfied.	5star
Food is OK. Bartenders are OK.  I've had two super shitty experiences with rude staff here (one of which was the owner), which sucks, because the staff sets the tone for the whole place, which I sometimes find pretentious.  I like the dude with the afro, though, Kyle.  He's super cool.  The cook is cool, too, and so is the patio.	3star
As someone who eats drunken noodles 2x a week, these were the worst drunken noodles I've ever had. It was basically like eating noodle candy, it was that sweet. I requested medium spicy, and there is LITERALLY NO SPICE AT ALL. So you basically have the sweetest noodles in the world with veggies - prepare yourself.	1star
"Do not come to Glasserie if you expect to be treated with decency. The food was absolutely stunning. However, our meal was presided over by the rudest waiter I have ever encountered, who repeatedly insulted me, my friends, and my family. Our waiter constantly sassed us like a passive-aggressive teenager, coldly correcting one my family members' pronunciation of ""demi-sec,"" and flat out insulting one of the members of our party for simply asking if de-caffeinated coffee was available. Even getting our waiter's attention was impossible as he strolled by our table. It seemed he was trying to ignore us--strange, considering we were one of only two parties dining at Glasserie that night. These are just a few of many slights that ruined our evening. This young man's nasty attitude sucked the joy out of the room, and made everyone in our party feel extremely uncomfortable. I for one did not plan to spend my evening with an emotionally-stunted, sharp-tongued waiter. I can't help but wonder how a Michelin-rated restaurant could allow for such an astounding lapse in quality. In fact, I would be shocked if I had this experience at any restaurant. I'm sorry to say I will not eat at Glasserie again and would not recommend it to anyone."	1star
"I had a total knockout dinner here nearly two months ago. Thank god everyone I was with went for the tasting menu so I could indulge fully. Also thank god I wasn't paying for it. Unfortunately, business meals mean pulling out a phone to take pictures is frowned upon and, coupled with the copious drinks, my memory of this is now hazy. I will say that Gramercy Tavern is no longer on the cutting edge-- many of the dishes I had here I've seen elsewhere. A couple different fish dishes (one decent, one stellar), an excellent duck breast, a gazpacho; it all looked and tasted a bit like the usual suspects. Only a couple of things were trying to show off, like the tomato-basil ice cream at the end. But the level of execution is so high, and everything so simply delicious, that I'll excuse it. Everything tasted like summer gently bridging into fall. What also pushes them over the top for me is an uncommonly good beverage program, with many by-the-glass wines, a wide selection of nightcaps, and fantastic pairings. Service is, as always, strong. I think if I looked back at what we paid and the reputation, I could split hairs about some of the dishes here; I don't know that it's ""best in the world."" But as it was, I practically floated out of the restaurant. An excellent experience with that hard-to-quantify feel-good factor."	5star

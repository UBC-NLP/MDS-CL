"Bette than the average take out but not yout sit down level. It's basically fuddruckers took over szchuanfood, this would be it. There is certain standardization  to its menu given that it's a chain, but taste and seasoning deviates based on who is in the kitchen. Had a half hour break in Chinatown on errands so stopped in for a quick spicy beef noodle dish.  The noodles were nice and chewy, either someone or the machine stretched the heck out of that gluten and I love it!  Chinese noodles are supposed to be chewy with  a nice bite and spring! The seasoning was not spicy nor numbing.  So a bit disappointing.  But this is pretty standard as I've been to other locations and they are all your ""not Chinese person"" level of spicy, lol. It's great for a quick lunch or dinner but nothing to travel for."
Pizza  slice is not a friend to my palate. The bread and pizza sauce didn't have enough flavor the sauce has a sour taste and the bread has a soggy texture. 2 stars given for the great customer service and decor of the establishment but unfortunately the pizza wasn't a highlight for me.
I probably get to dine in fancy-pansy restaurants about 3-4 times a year, usually on very special occasions. So when I went to Gotham to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday, I was under the assumption that I'd get the same extraordinary service that I received from the upscale restaurants I've visited in the past. Sadly, I was actually disappointed with this place. Now don't get me wrong - the food was just absolutely terrific! I got the tuna tartare, which was just heavenly. The seafood risotto was hands down my favorite part of the entire meal - so full of flavor, it was just perfect. My main entree was the lobster and short rib, which was wonderful - lobster was perfectly cooked and short rib was so tender that it ripped right off of my fork. The food wasn't the problem, but the service was the part I was not impressed with. After finishing our second course, the third course took over 30 minutes to arrive, which was a lot longer than I expected. During the wait, our waiter never came by to let us know why it was delayed. On that note, our waiter wasn't really as attentive with us as I would've liked. It took about 25 mins between the time we first got seated to the time he finally took our orders. As it was my boyfriend's birthday, I thought I had noted in the reservation as such - and was a little surprised that I was still issued a dessert menu. Usually in many other restaurants that have a special occasion noted in the reservation, dessert would come as a freebie honoring that occasion. Our waiter took back the menus after we declined, and after another 10 mins, as if it was an afterthought, one of the busboys came by to our table with a little cup of mini cakes with a lit candle...and what a sad little cup of mini cakes it was! I saw on Yelp that many people got chocolate cakes and other legit desserts for their birthdays, so I was kind of surprised, and a little sad to have gotten this instead, which I believe every table got at the end of their meals anyway... Anyway, the decor was great, and I really appreciated that they honored my note in the reservation to give us secluded seating, but the quality of service was just lackluster.
Made reservations for 7PM on Friday and showed up an hour early because we got out of work earlier than expected - They happily seated us ahead of our reservation time. We sat on the upper level, right by the windows with a nice view of Union Square. We ordered a few items off of the happy hour menu before moving onto dinner - Soy Garlic Wings, Truffle Fries and 1-Thyme Cocktails. Soy garlic wings were yummy - similar to what you get at Bon Chon. Truffle Fries weren't very truffle-y but we enjoyed the kimchi mayo dipping sauce. The 1-thyme cocktail was SO good. If I was in the mood, I would've ordered 2 or 3 more. Soju, St. Germain, thyme syrup and grapefruit all mixed together for a potentially dangerous but extremely yummy cocktail. Ok, so for dinner, the two of us shared bulgogi beef tacos - there are other filling options but you're required to pick one filling for all three tacos, which was a slight bummer but that's okay! We also ordered seafood pancake and kimchi fried rice. The tacos came first and they were served with a mild green hot sauce - small in size but packed with flavor. Considering they were $16, I was hoping for full-size tacos... By the time the seafood pancake and kimchi fried rice came to our table, we were so stuffed. I took a few bites of the kimchi fried rice - kimchi to rice ratio was a little off but I enjoyed it. Seafood pancake was good, too, but no stand out. We ended up taking the rest of the kimchi fried rice and seafood pancake home because we ordered way too much for what our stomachs could handle at the time. Overall, my boyfriend and I really enjoyed our first dining experience at Barn Joo. The servers are SO attentive. It really made all the difference in our meal. My glass of water was never empty. Every time the candle on our table blew out, our waiter came by to light it back up. So thank you to our servers for really making that extra effort! It definitely did not go unnoticed. Next time we go to Barn Joo, I think we'll strictly stick to happy hour menu items because the dinner menu is on the pricier side in relation to the portion size. Nonetheless, still excited for our next visit so I can have another 1-thyme cocktail :)
Upstate has been on my list for years - so happy the BF & I finally went for dinner this past weekend.  The wait was a bit long (close to an hour) but understandable given the size of the restaurant and its popularity.  We usually never pay full price for oysters since there are so many excellent happy hours in the city, but their extensive list was so appealing that we ordered three varieties each.  All of them were excellent - specifically the ones from Virginia and New Zealand.   To start, we had the uni appetizer which was good but I don't think either of us were huge fans of the texture of the uni mixed with salmon roe and egg yolk.  I would have much rather used the uni as a spreadable paste for the toasts!  We then shared the fettuccine with clams and the scallops over mushroom risotto.  Both were hearty and delicious. The complimentary whiskey pound cake was certainly a nice finishing touch!  I'm sure we'll be back soon!
The food was just a little over average, Service was also prompt. But thats about it. I just could not figure out why the prices were so high except for the fact that they must have big rent on fifth ave. we sat in the back room which seem like a room that you may find in any other restaurant. There was nothing special about the Decor, The salmon tasted great but the portion was the size that would feed a small pigeon. You could always market price is high but two things has to be perfect your food or your Decor, they were both average. The waiters seemed to be happy working there but should not be fooling around in the back room  and Making the place look like a standard diner. If you want to give a table a bill of 150-200 for 2 people you really should make the environment worth it.
"Are all these reviewers blind? Watery green curry with boiled chicken? ""Spicy rice noodles with duck"" that taste like duck sauce? Fried cat fish with basil sauce that tastes like ketchup? Steamed thai chicken dumplings that taste like peanut butter?  This restaurant has got to be one of the crappiest dining experiences I've ever had. My wife and I got home two hours later with the worst stomach aches.  I don't recommend this place at all... I'm usually relatively lenient with my reviews but this place was absolutely horrendous. Go to ""up Thai"" for a good thai food experience in the uptown area . This place is a complete joke."
This was very disappointing. We went for lunch and everything was over seasoned.  First, the bread to start was cold. For the main dish, we got the 1. Pretzel crusted calamari, 2. the Angel Hair pasta, 3. Sea bass, 4. Roasted cod. The main proteins (fish) were well cooked but the sauces for every dish was way too salty, over-seasoned. The pasta was soaked in oil.  However, I do have to say, their fresh orange juice was pretty amazing. I would just go and to-go an orange juice and be happy. The service was nice too. I heard their brunch was really good though. But,agh, at least for lunch, the sauces just killed it :(
My girlfriend and I came here for brunch, and spent $45 on food that we would have preferred to avoid. The seasoning was down pat, but the cooking times were easily forgotten. I ordered the hangar steak and eggs. My eggs came nearly raw, as did my steak (ordered medium). When I informed our waitress of the mistake, she took the steak back to the kitchen. Upon returning, my steak was still raw (photo attached), and after showing the waitress, nothing was offered to make my experience better. Everything else in the meal was equally as disappointing.
Yes, yes, and yes! This place was amazing. The food was great, atmosphere awesome. We didn't have a wait but cramped NYC style. All that aside Go. Eat. Enjoy! Oh and have some saki
Do not come here on a weekend!  At least not until they hire more waitstaff. I came here on a Sunday for brunch and the place was pretty packed. I tried to find someone, anyone who I could ask about a table. No sooner than I step through the threshold do I get nearly run over by a waiter sprinting through the restaurant. No apologies. He just kept right on going. The people are packed like sardines in this tiny dining room. Finally, I head butted my way to a woman standing behind a counter and managed to get us an empty table outside. From that point on, we waited about 15 mins for water, 30 minutes to order, and another 30 after we were done with our meal for the check to come. What really infuriated me was that a French couple at the next table sat down after us and were served much more quickly. Basically, no attention was paid to us the entire time. This is by far one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. The owners here try to pack as many tables into the restaurant as possible, hire as few people as possible in order to lower costs and maximize profit at the expense of the customer's experience. It's such a shame because the food was not bad. However, I will never come here again. Get your act together!
My fiance said that I eat like a linebacker.  I think he's exaggerating just a tad, but I do love my food in large quantity.  The idea of tapas does not appeal to me at all.  Food in small quantities?  Pffffttt...  However, when one of my friends took me here one Saturday afternoon, I was absolutely smitten.  This is the perfect place to stop by after a long day of shopping in Soho (don't forget to drop by Harney & Sons for some tea!).  The space is simple but beautiful and well kept.  It's casual but also feels like a great escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.   They have wine, beer, little sandwiches, pintxos and small quiche-like dishes that are absolutely delicious.  Yes, a little expensive since you won't get full.   They have sausage and serrano ham samples at the deli counter up front, and bread and olive oil samples.  Stop by for an afternoon treat, try a few Spanish beers, and pick up some delicious serrano ham for later.  I recommend it for a casual lunch or afternoon snack.
We went on Jan. 23 we were the only people there all day b/c of the snow. The staff was funny & we had a good laugh about going out in the blizzard. We had the mezze feast it was really good. The cocktails were excellent and intricate. I would love to go back on a day that wasn't a whiteout.
Sloooowly making my way to all the must-see NYC BBQ destinations. My group was hungry post-movie, and though I'd already eaten earlier, I figured a quarter-pound of brisket and a couple brews was still just fine. Plus, I had to flex this fresh 'Elite' tag a little bit. :) The open-air setup works well for a barbecue joint. Helps the place breathe and sends delicious aromas off into the Williamsburg night. Picnic tables and a great bar to snag beers at while waiting in line. Line itself moved quickly. The brisket was solid--didn't compare to the recently-discovered, life-changing Hometown BBQ variety, but it was certainly above average. The best sauce was in a slightly short and stout bottle and was slightly sweet with some extreme kick. I don't know if it's consistently in that bottle, but squirt around a bit and you'll get there. I got a side of broccoli slaw, which was basically big, fresh hunks of broccoli doused in a vinegar-based rub and spices. Delicious, but not exactly what I was expecting. A couple potato rolls on the side? Hell yes. I used to come home from school and crush a sack of these in the afternoon. Nostalgia-inducing, that's the way to go. Nice ambiance; stellar 'cue. Not a single negative thing to say about Fette Sau.
Not completely sure how to pronounce the name of the restaurant, but it's ok, the food is amazing! Service is nothing to rave about, but that's typical and seating is pretty tight. The restaurant was pretty big though with more space in the back. We got 2 white rice, 1 coconut rice (really good, give it a try), roti canai (light, crispy, and soft all in one), clay pot noodle (large pot good for sharing), the Hainanese chicken, and the lemongrass squid (based on the waiter's recommendation). All of this fed 4 people and we still had left overs.  The chicken was really tender, I'm usually not a fan of chicken prepared this way, but this is something I would love to eat again. Our group was very indecisive and we asked the waiter for his favorite seafood dish and he suggested the lemongrass squid so we tried it. LOVED it! I've never had squid prepared this way and it was just so flavorful.  Overall, this place has great food for the adventurous soul who wants to try something different.  *Cash only.
This place is an unbearable mess and disaster. It's overcrowded and the setup has zero logical thinking behind it.  You get a ticket and then you have to battle and fight against other people with tickets squeezing in to even get your taco order started! These are not tickets to pick up your order, which would make sense. The taco makers don't even know you have an order, although you paid already.  You stand there like an idiot with a piece of paper and hope that someone notices you among the other 50 people pushing toward the counter with a ticket. Today I stood there for 15 minutes with my tickets and not even one instance of eye contact with the guys making the tacos. I asked for a refund. Just couldn't get my food that I already paid for.  A complete disaster, avoid for your own sanity.
So happy I finally made it to this place! I'm a little ashamed it took me so long... Ordered the beef noodles, mildly spicy, and the cold noodles. I was nervous because I'm not one for spice, but both turned out to be a good heat level. The beef was tender and the noodles were great. I'll definitely be trying the noodles in the broth next time.
Really cute hole in the wall spot with terrible customer service. My friend and I were excited to try La Contenta but were completely disappointed. Upon arrival (Sunday 7/16 ~12pm), we requested an outdoor table because we had our dog with us, and the hostess was not only dismissive but rude and condescending. She mentioned the only available table was being held for a reservation, which is fine, but she didn't offer us another available time or options. Her b*tchy attitude was unnecessary. My friend and I stood there in disbelief that she would be so nasty without reason, said nothing, and another employee came out and was nice to us to try to salvage the situation.  While it's fine to be busy during brunch, the least she could've done is recommended we return in another couple of hours. Instead what she did was push 2 prospective customers away. La Contenta should reconsider who is greeting and dealing with customers. We took our business to Poco instead.
"I won't be coming back here. The interior was well done, especially the bathroom sign.  The drinks are fine. Not great, not bad. Just fine. There are better options in the neighborhood at the same or lesser price. The oysters were the best thing on the menu. But at $3 an oyster, there are better options in the neighborhood at a lesser price. The food was ok. We had the gazpacho, which I've made better myself. The octopus was paired with cucumbers and thinly sliced jalapeño with a heavy dose of vinegar. The trout came on a bed of cherry tomatoes and fingerling potatoes over a tart kind of spread of indeterminable content. With both dishes my impression was the same - the ingredients just sort of co-existed on the plate with little thought put in to how they might interact. They looked nice. Nothing was burned or anything, but nothing really worked together. Overall, it's just another mediocre overpriced Brooklyn restaurant that leans way too heavily on the TGI-Friday's fake old timey schtick (See also: Rye, Walter Foods, Marlowe & Sons, et all). Our bill was just north $120 and we left hungry. That's about the same let down per dollar as River Styx, but without enjoying delicious-tasting, inventive food and cocktails. But whatever, overpriced faux-sentimental so-called ""new"" American mediocrity is what Brooklyn dining has become. Why the one star review? The bathroom sink has separate handles and spouts for hot and cold water. They built the bathroom in this restaurant. It used to be a coffee shop with a different layout, so there's no historical excuse. The cook that just took a dump has to play a game between scalding hot and freezing cold water instead of thoroughly washing his hands before he shucks your raw oysters because the owners thought that the fake old timey schtick was just too cool to pass up. If they wanted to be all Mumford & Sons and pretend that pre-prohibition life wasn't an intense rush to an untimely death by lack of hygiene then that lack of imagination is on them, but couldn't they at least have a plumber join the hot and cold pipes before splitting it under the sink so that both came out warm? Or hey, since they already went full-retard, why not just include the drain plug those old-timey sinks came with so people would fill the basin, wash their hands, and then drain it? Oh, because then people would actually talk about what a inconvenient problem it was instead of returning to their table with fecal matter on their hands. Bon Appetit, Alameda!"
Finally came to try SriPraPhai after almost everyone recommended this place to me! To start off, I had the curry puffs and the papaya salad. I normally order the papaya salad at Thai restaurants but I've never had one that was spicy! I love spicy and thought that this was the best papaya salad I've ever had. My bf had to look for papaya for me because I could not stop eating it! It made my tongue hurt but it was worth it. The curry puffs were pretty good. It was my first time having them so I can't really compare them to another previous occasion. But I'd much rather stick with the papaya salad. I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai and I would have to say it was pretty similar to other pad Thai I've had. It didn't stand out much but they did give a huge serving that I ended up taking the rest to-go.  My bf ordered the Drunken Noodles which were just as good. They had a spicy kick to it and there was a good amount of basil incorporated in the dish. Overall, SriPraPhai did not disappoint. The main dish that stood out to me was the papaya salad and I would travel out to Woodside for this. The other dishes, I can probably find a Thai restaurant near me that can satisfy my cravings.  Also, Cash only. And tip: if you go around 7PM, you are almost guaranteed to find parking in less than 10 minutes.
This is probably my favorite ramen place. It's usually pretty crowded and loud so it's pretty hard to talk or hear in there. The servers constantly yell in Japanese whenever a new customer is seated l, which also adds to the noise. Regardless, the vibe at the restaurant is great.  The pork buns are definitely my favorite appetizer. It's a bit pricy for the portions you get, but it tastes great. The frozen Kirin is kind of whatever so I'd go with another beer. All the ramen I tried there were good so you should be fine with which ever suits your preferences! I personally love the spicy ramen.
5 stars for the service and 3 for the food. The most memorable part was the service. Our waiter was attentive without being overbearing and very friendly. My group tried the Moussaka, Scallops and the Combination Platter. There were only 4 scallops on the plate. The funny thing is that the waiter told me that the scallops were REALLY big that night. Sigh. The Moussaka was good but a bit too heavy/creamy. I overheard my waiter telling the table next to me that the Moussaka was the best in NY. Hahaha. The best part was the Combination Platter. It was filling, delicious and flavorful.
I've been fortunate enough to eat ramen all over the world including Tokyo and Osaka in Japan.  This hands down is the best I've had this side of the planet. Amazing ingredients and such depth of flavor with the broth.  Anytime I'm in in NYC I will be here (everyday)!
Used to love this spot. Today the service and food was a huge let down. Over 30 min for two appetizers to come out with no acknowledgment from the staff. Also the price increase is awful. 14$ for five mediocre buffalo shrimp(a 5 count) and the same for room temp 'fried' calamari. I have loved this spot for years and hope it gets its game back. But improve the service staff, their attention, and most importantly the fire times and food quality. Again, have loved this place and heir food in the past but it needs to work at going back uphill again.
My kind of bar.  Funky little place with some cool quirky design choices, a great courtyard, and a few different seating nook and crannies for you to settle into. Had a great night here with a large group of friends that were spread out all over the place. Burgers were ok, not top notch, but decent enough.  Other Yelpers may be complaining of the lack of service, (pay at the bar as you go - no need to sort the bill at the end of the night), but as a traveler accustomed to a more laid-back style of service, this just felt like home to me.
I should preface I'm not a sushi connoisseur, but I'm always down to try new restaurants. That being said, I wasn't wowed by the sushi at Sushi Yasaka.  I got the 6 piece omakase that cost $24 and I thought that was actually a really good price. The two pieces I really liked was the roll and the sushi that was topped with a jalapeño on top (sorry, I don't remember the specific types of fish). Those were super delicious and melted in my mouth. The other pieces were just okay to me.
Wow, this place has gone downhill. Fast! For some unknown reason they have decided to turn the music up at around 9-10 pm so loud that it is totally impossible to have a normal conversation. it's not a nightclub! We left immediately after they turned up the music and I'm not coming back..
Be warned that there WILL be a long wait for a table as this place is VERY popular. It's also tiny on the inside, the tables are crammed together in a small area so don't expect a peaceful brunch! I consider myself lucky to have scored a seat at the bar (there are only 3 seats there) without having to wait long. Ordered the infamous green shakshuka (i.e. 2 baked eggs in a green tomatillo shakshuka served with challah toast) and thought it was just ok... Perhaps lacking some flavor. I also would have preferred the shakshuka to be thicker - the one served to me seemed a little watery. At least this dish was reasonably priced at only $12.
Those who advised against eating ramen in the summer clearly had never been to Kuu Ramen before. This ramen spot has to be one of the most authentic and best ramen spots in the city. Because it was my first time I went with the classic/most popular ramen. The noodles were firm, the broth was delicious, and the price and wait time were fine. When it comes to ramen I do not like to toss out high praises to every joint I go to, however this place deserves it. KUU RAMEN is a must hit for any ramen lover. Scratch that, a must hit for any food lover.
Interesting looking menu, and while the chicken/cauliflower puree I ordered was tasty - it wasn't all that satisfying.  The chicken was tender and crispy at once - but also a bit too salty.  The puree was a bit too watery, and I wish more substantial.  I also got the lemon square for dessert and found it solid. Cool setting, very busy for a Tues night in Tribeca, but the reason for such a poor review is the poor service.  It was totally uncoordinated, cold, and unreasonably slow, especially since I said I was in a rush.  After I finished my dinner, I was simply ignored for well over 10 minutes (I was dining alone -- I'd think servers should take note), and when the waitress finally came by, she wasn't even sure if I had received the main dish! I told her I wasn't happy about waiting so long, especially since I mentioned I was in a rush.  She did her best to correct the remainder of my stay - but a bit too little too late.  Sorry, I just get so cranky when I have to work late  AND I'm starving.  Just let me have a nice meal and I will tip you handsomely.  Screw that up, and I'll just fume.
This place is hard to find! I hated it when I saw them making the soup right in front  of us and by an unprofessional chef who act as a cashier and owner! I had Korean food at some great Korean places with the same price and I think Doma is doing it wrong by applying it in a easy way. Their rice cakes tasted like a instant rice cakes. In conclusion, I think u will get the same dish with the same price in some other place with a awesome quality.
This gets one star because 0 is not an option and they did have free mediocre cocktails with brunch.  Ordered the tuna tartar taco and the kale and eggs salad. Waiter came back later, sorry no tuna tartare. Ok, no problem. Looking forward to the kale with roasted market veg and manchego What arrived was a bowl of kale with some canned garbanzos and eggs. For $16 they could have at least put it on a plate with a side bowl of house potatoes like the other brunch dishes. Asked the waiter where are the roasted market vegetables. He went to check, they took it away, maitre d apologized, said they will bring another. 10 mins later they brought another of the SAME THING. So what changed? I asked where are the roasted  market vegetables - she pointed to the 5 garbanzos You can get a better salad in the fridge at your local CVS.
Good good food. Service was ok. Harder since we had a large group for my bf bday at the time. We had a nice large table. Decor was beautiful and classy. Would come here again with less people and try their exotic dishes.
I visited Mondayoff shortly after its grand opening. The restaurant had plenty of seats and a cute layout (forest vibes and an electric neon Instagram-worthy sign). I ordered their shrimp pad thai lunch special which came with 2 mini egg rolls. The rolls were crispy and the noodles were well-seasoned. I wish the shrimps were bigger to make the dish more hearty. For dessert we ordered the durian sticky rice with the intention of trying a new fruit. The dish looked like rice pudding and came with a miniature scoop of vanilla ice cream. The pudding tasted like onion mush. We each tried one spoonful and hated it. We left over all of the pudding and tried to wash out the onion flavor with the ice cream. When the waitress noticed we left it over she asked us if we wanted a different dessert (we declined). When the bill came we saw they charged us for the dessert (which was fine, but considering it is a brand new business I felt that they should have gone more out of their way to ensure that their customers are happy).
This is the worst steakhouse in the whole City and I don't understand how people like it. I've been forced to go here three times and every time my food was literally inedible.  I very much realize I'm in the minority here. Pete loves this place but I keep trying it and DF keeps disappointing me. They have all the steakhouse favorites and my favorite part of any steakhouse are the sides! Much more than the steak or fishes.  DF has crab Mac and cheese, lobster bisque, creamed spinach etc. I just don't like any of it. The service is polite and professional. Like all steakhouses, it's expensive AF.
I went out of my way to come to Izakaya and arrived at 10:20 pm on a Friday night. The staff informed us that they have completely sold out of food. I was pretty disappointed after walking so far to get here. They close at midnight, so they're going to lose out on 2 hours' worth of customer? I haven't written this place off and will be back again. Hopefully, there will be some food to actually review next time!
Spotted this colorful little restaurant while walking around Ft. Greene.  It's eye catching for sure and a fun little spot to have very delicious frozen margaritas.   I'm always annoyed by cash only establishments but hey, everyone gets to choose.   So know this, it's Cash Only. We ordered two frozen margs, a roasted pork plate, a pork burrito, plantains and an elote.  Ran us around $45 bucks.   The elote was pretty sizable and charred to perfection, as was my portion of plantains.  I wasn't wowed by the pork.  There were some dry bits on my platter and the burrito lacked spice and creamy texture.  Probably could have used a dollop of sour scream or guacamole or salsa.  It did come with a heaping portion of jalepeños, probably to impart the heat that was lacking on the burrito itself. I would definitely come back for elotes and margs in the future.  The patio is super fun and has a constant musical loop of old school tunes.  It's shaded and clean and the food comes out fast.  In the meantime I'll have to continue my search for awesome Cuban food.
Amazing food and customer service! I went a few months ago with my boyfriend after hearing about it on TV. We went and had an amazing meal so we decided to go back for his birthday. Last night, after taking an Uber specifically for this meal, we got in a line that was out the door. After a few minutes the manager, Jeremy, came out to inform us that there would not be any food by the time we got to the front. While we were disappointed, he gave us his card and told us to contact him for the next time we wanted to come out. We really appreciated that he was upfront about it so we did not wait in line. My boyfriend sent him an email and we went back today with some friends. I can't emphasize enough: the food and service were incredible. Jeremy made sure we were taken care of.  As far as the food goes, the beef ribs are the best I've ever had. I can highly recommend the beef ribs (they are HUGE), the Jamaica jerk baby back ribs, the brisket, and the pulled pork. As for the sides, the beans were delicious and our rest of the party also loved the mac & cheese and potato salad. The atmosphere has a cool Americana vibe. Open seating, great live music, and a full bar.  I just really can't say enough about how impressed we were with not only the food, but the service. Customers for life!
when deciding on a place to go for my husband's birthday in city I had a whole list but I settled on this one after seeing the duck raviolis. I'm sort of crazy I know exactly what I want to eat before I go a place lol. my husband pretty much has no say :) except in his drink. but lucky for me he loves everything. anyway the creamy polenta I have to say is one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life. just order it and don't ask questions lol.  everything was just perfect. also it's so easy to get to from penn station on the subway that it's a huge excuse to come back since it's so easy :) the duck ravioli was probably my favorite along with the spaghetti of course. I also really liked the agnolotti. I'm on a mission for all the best pasta dishes and this was definitely one of them. you will not be disappointed. I also loved how airy it felt inside. usually nyc restaurants it's low ceilings, you know how nyc is. just such a nice space. it was the perfect birthday dinner.
This was my first visit here for brunch and I was pretty excited to try  the soul food here.  My friend made reservations for us which seems to be necessary as the place is small and gets really packed for weekend brunch. We were seated right away but then we just sat there waiting for our server.  Our waiter was pretty much unavailable most of the time,  we waited quite a while after being seated for water and the menu. Once we placed our orders, I asked our server for the drink menu because in my mind it's not a real brunch without some alcohol. After about 10 minutes our server still had not come by to check on anything or bother bringing the drink menu, finally my friend got his attention and reminded him about the menu. While most times I'm pretty relax and understanding if servers are very busy,  the experience felt very unorganized and the service was practically non-existent. We both ordered the smothered fried chicken and eggnog waffles. I must say that the food was delicious! The smothered chicken was absolutely amazing, the gravy was so good and the sweetness of the waffle made it the perfect combination. I'm a big chicken and waffles fan and I really think this was one of the best I've had. Honestly if my review was about the food alone then it would be 5 stars but the service was just lacking. If you want to try some delicious smothered chicken and waffles I would definitely recommend, just be aware that service does not appear to be a strong suit here.
"Please don't go here. It's highway robbery.  It's so overpriced and not authentic. Starters are amuse bouche sizes and entrees are appetizer sizes. It's so not worth it - I would understand if the food was excellent - it's just ok and again not the real deal by a long shot. The pupusas are a joke. Got swordfish skewers (""deconstructed"" tacos) for $15 and it came with 3 thumb size chunks of swordfish, tortillas and veggies and guac - meh on the taste. Service is slow. Drinks take a little longer than expected (dinner time on a week night). It's not good, don't be fooled. The place looks nice and is packed but it's got awful acoustics (super loud) and it's kinda tight inside. I don't mind spending on GOOD food but this is not right in so many levels. Skip this spot. Conclusion: it's a hip spot waiting to rip you off with fancy cocktails and ""exotic"" latin food. 1 star - Witching Hour cocktail (it was amazing) (and honestly cocktails are good - but that is expected) 2 star - hip looking"
I joined a group here for an after work get together. The ambiance is nice. The place is clean and the drinks are good. However, it took the LONGEST to get bar food because the kitchen was closed. This was around 5 pm on a Friday! I don't understand how this could happen. When food was finally available, it was good, but I soon left. Id recommend, but go later maybe to ensure the kitchen is fully staffed and open, unless you dont require snacks as you drink.
Jacob's Pickles! How I miss living on the west side! This place is my jam. I have zero negative things to say - except one time I came back after receiving a text notification that my table was ready and the hostess gave me a little mouth for being 2 minutes late. Other than that, the staff are all very accommodating, friendly, patient, and professionalism. This spot is gorgeous for brunch and also dinner. My usual routine is to put my name down and grab coffee while I'm waiting! Everything pickled of their is amazing, I LOVE their Kentucky Porch Sipper drink, and everything else is delicious. Also appreciate that they sources from local farms and company's. Can be pricey but definitely worth it!
We cancelled our orders and walked out of OBAO due to the lack of food after an infuriating 40 minutes where people around us came after us, ordered the same meal as us- but received their food faster than us. We did not receive any of our food or drinks requested. Last week, we waited 20 minutes after ordering our food. The couple that sat beside us arrived 10 mins after us and ordered two glasses of wine with one of the same dishes and the same tom yum soup appetizers we did. (My dining partner ordered the pad kraw pao and the dude ordered a pad thai). So when their food came out before us- that was just astounding. But it happens. We flagged down a waitress and inquired about our entrees, and she told us apologetically that the kitchens were backed up. Meaning that our food orders weren't even prepared yet. Alright, so we politely requested our thai iced tea and perhaps our soup appetizers, since we were very hungry. So it was even more bewildering to us that another table who arrived 20 minutes after us got their soup appetizers and food ten minutes AFTER she politely told us about the kitchen situation. We requested our thai iced tea but did not receive it... Are you going to tell me that the bar area was backed up too? Because I know that thai iced teas are made by the bar counter side- I've only come to OBAO every other week for the past half month (sometimes forgetting to check in on yelp though, oops). My partner cancelled our orders and we walked out because we could no longer justify waiting 45+ mins at OBAO for our food and instead ate at Chipotle. I can no longer justify my previous recommendations on yelp. Disappointing experience.
One of the rare cases of trusting yelp and walking away disappointed. Not sure why many people seem to like it... We got a fresh veggie salad (tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, olive oil) - ok, just like something you would throw together at home; begodya (also known as pegodya or pense) - a Korean version of Chinese steam buns with pork and cabbage; not bad but the filling was not as flavorful; manty (big dumplings) - tasty but nothing special; and kotlety (ground beef meatballs of sorts) with mashed potato - also tasty but nothing special. And a pot of tea - a pot of hot water with one Ahmad tea bag in it. I have nothing bad to say about the place itself (clean, decent size, and conveniently located) or service (quick and more or less attentive), but the food (at least what we had) was just ok; steam bun was definitely microwaved (I've heard microwave bell and the bun was brought out soon after) and I have a feeling they don't really cook food (or cook all of the food) at the premises, more like order it from somewhere frozen and microwave when ordered; and of course you don't really expect a tea bag when you order a pot of tea. Prices, on the contrary, are the same or even somewhat higher than neighboring places. Which may also have something to do with the fact that there were only two people there on a Sunday afternoon, and most other places, as I've seen later, were packed. I had much better food at a street food stand. Will not be back.
The food here is unbelievable!!!! I had to stop myself from eating my fingers because the cheese from the Mexican Corn got on them.
We dropped by for dinner on a Saturday night, and had to wait a while before being seated at the bar. Due to the busy night and lack of space, it was rather crammed.  I had the spicy sausage rice cakes, and liked that the rice cakes had a slight crisp to it, however the dish was too salty. Perhaps, next time I'll have to try something else.
First off, I can't imagine a more lovely setting for an evening out. Right by the river, right under the Brooklyn bridge, across a cobblestone street, nestled in the trees sparkling with twinkle lights, sits this lovely little cafe. Not to mention that the restaurant itself, especially as night falls, is breathtaking. It would be an amazing location for a wedding reception. The yellow-and-white striped awnings, the little outdoor deck area, the flowers everywhere, the wrought-iron portholes - transport your to another moment in time. The only issue is that they clearly overbook the small space, so that you have to navigate a very tight maze in order to get from the back of the restaurant to the front again. The service was fine with some snafus; we had to wait 15 minutes to be seated for a reservation made a month prior, despite our special request for a window seat (again - made a month prior, the maximum window for a reservation), we were seated at a booth, we were waited on by a number of wait staff, several of whom were so inattentive that my coffee was cold by the time I got a refill, etc. You would think that for these prices, the wait staff would be better curated and the service better orchestrated. The food was good on one end: my duck was OUTSTANDING. I shoveled it down lest I got too full to finish, lol. Outstanding, I've never had better duck in my entire life. Order it Medium-Rare and it will grace your dreams for years to come. However, the first course was tiny (an itty-bitty salad), my side dishes with the duck (a sliver of red cabbage and cracker-consistency sweet potato spaetzle) were unimpressive, and the desserts were also small and anti-climactic. It's one thing to spend a good chunk of money on an amazing entree like the duck, it's another to spend $120 on a 3-course meal that wasn't worth the $120 for what you get in terms of portion size and quality.  Despite its downfalls, River Cafe was romantic and beautiful, the service was adequate, and part of my meal was to die for. My reaction is that I've had better, more filling meals for less than $120, which is why I can't bring myself to value the food at the price, or give River Cafe more than 3 stars.
I have been living in New York for almost 2 years now this my second Christmas celebrated here, and every year I go to Amy Ruth's. the line outside might be intimidating but they move very fast. Down to waiters, the bust boys and the beautiful paintings on the wall it makes for an all around great atmosphere. Now the food!! The food comes out exactly how it's described. FREAKING DELICIOUS!!! Very well seasoned, nice flavors just makes me want to eat there everyday!! Just take a look at my pictures you'll see!!
Oh Traif, why did it take me so long to find you?  Since my first visit 6 months ago I've been four times and each time has been wonderful.  Don't be silly and not get the chef's tasting.  That's where it's at. 10 courses plus an amuse bouche and two deserts for $55. Add the wine pairing for $35 and you have an extraordinary meal for a reasonable price.  Highlights are definitely the Munster cheese pot (don't pretend you won't need extra dipping toasts and ask for them right away), the sweetbreads, the spare ribs with cinnamon and strawberries, the pork sliders with sweet potato fries and the scallops which were prepared differently each time and always great.  One of the times we did the brunch tasting which was fewer courses (thought plenty of food) for $35.  The chilaquiles and the egg sandwich sliders were standouts as well as the Not Very Bloody Mary made with homemade roasted tomatillo juice, a refreshing and very green twist on a classic brunch cocktail. Excellent service as well.  Make a reservation!
"Uglyduckling is the newest addition to the many adorable shops and eateries along Smith St. This street is a favorite of mine -- so naturally when searching for a nice place to grab a drink/grub after a crazy week at work, my friend and I wandered into Cobble Hill.  Only 2 weeks old, the Uglyduckling offers a diverse selection of American /Gastropub cuisine as well as a nice wall of craft beers on tap. It has a cool, hip vibe with the mismatch wooden panels on the wall, giant tv screens, vintage lighting and chalkboard artwork to name a few. There's not a whole lot of seating but for the size of the place, they definitely utilize what space they have. We decided on sitting at the bar for dinner... and much to my surprise, they have bag hooks! Ladies (or gentlemen) your wishes have been granted. But in all seriousness, its a small but important perk. I thought to myself, ""what to choose, what to choose"" when glancing at the beers along the wall. And then my eyes fell upon the Left Handed Brewing Co. NITRO MILK STOUT. I've been searching for this beer for the LONGEST time. So glad it's at a bar nearby! And might I mentioned it was perfectly poured and delicious. As for the menu, very interesting items. I ended up choosing the Chicken and Waffles ($16). I was intrigued at the combination of the classic dish but with a side of spicy aioli. The buttermilk waffle was fluffy and equally crispy as the corn-flake crusted chicken. The spicy aioli was a nice touch, although I'm not sure if everyone would like that combination of flavors. But all in all, my dish was great. I would definitely order it again. Not only was the food tasty, but the staff was personable and welcoming. Most of the staff are from Ireland so I immediately struck up a few conversations about my good ol' days studying abroad in Limerick. Made for some great banter. Next time... my eyes are on the Pork Belly & Quail Egg Burger. Wishing the staff of Uglyduckling the best of luck! I'll be visiting again very soon. P.S. They're creating a brunch menu and a happy hour which should be finalized within a week or so. So keep your eyes peeled."
This place does NOT disappoint! I think I found my go-to place for Greek food, especially since I rarely find good Greek restaurants in NYC. Granted I don't actively go searching for them but they're definitely harder to locate than a good sushi place or dessert spot. My party of 3 got there just before 6pm on a Friday night. It was already super crowded but we only had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. I think we just beat the rush. The place is very spacious with many tables and outdoor seating, a bit surprising considering their kitchen is TINY. Word of advice though: once you put down your name, make sure you stay nearby so that the hostess can still see you. Otherwise she just seats other parties after you if she thinks you've disappeared. Once seated, we ordered the large Greek salad, grilled octopus, caviar dip, and the Kyclades seafood special. The salad came with two HUGE blocks of feta cheese. I'm not even a big fan of cheese and I still loved it. It complemented the rest of the salad perfectly. The grilled octopus was heaven. Grilled just enough to remain juicy and tender, not the least bit tough or chewy. The caviar dip was good too. We spread it over the free bread that came to the table. And the seafood special was delicious! It came with shrimp, lobster tail, scallops, stuffed clams, and fish. Everything was stuffed with crab meat, baked, and coated with a savory sauce. We got the lemon potatoes as the side, which was just the right amount of tangy to go with the seafood. They gave us free dessert at the end. It's somewhere between a really sweet pudding and a chewy, melted marshmallow. Great end to a fantastic meal! Our total came out to about $85, not including tip. Not bad for a seafood dinner for 3 people! I'd definitely come back again, maybe not all the way out to Astoria, but I heard they've opened up a location in East Village too. Will check out that next!
This has been a place I've wanted to try for a while now and I am so happy I finally went. The decor made me feel like I was in an upscale Asian castle. It can make you forget outside world and enjoy your meal.The menu is extensive Asian fusion. The plates are designed for you to share or eat individually. I went with my sister and we ordered one appetizer, two entrees, and a side which was enough for us. I recommend trying any dumpling because they are packed with flavor. We both ordered the chili chicken and let me tell you the sauce was out of this world and the chicken tasted like butter. Just thinking about it makes me hungry. I can't wait to go back!
This place is awful. So disappointing. the reception was very rude and unprofessional . He did not inform us that we had to wait until our last member should come to be seated and simply said that it would be 5 mins and the wait time was over 30 mins!!!! Last time that I was here the place was packed with smokers and had to leave early!!! I would npt recommend this place!!!! Dont bother to come here!!!! The worst experience ever.... Waited for thirty minutes for lunch really sucked!
Wow was this place a great experience! I was initially attracted to it because of the rave reviews mostly from locals! We tried to hit it up a few times for happy hour but always ended up missing the time. Finally, I gave up on happy hour and dragged my boyfriend here for dinner. It was Thursday night and they had about a 40 minute wait. Luckily, all the other yelpers gave good advice and we skipped across to another bar in the area for a drink.  We were called back and seated at the bar. The guy taking care of us was amazing ( i wish I remembered his name but this review is a bit over due as we were there is July). They had two sour beers on tap and I had both of them! Sour beer and oysters= a win! We were not too familiar with the oysters and had the guy helping us pick out some east coast stuff for us. It was all amazing! The rest of the meal was equally amazing, we had the clams and mussels and finished off with the whiskey cake which was pure perfection!
I ordered through Seamless pickup and was happy I didn't have to wait on the long line! It was my first time ordering from Luke's Lobster and I was a bit shocked at first by the small size and cheap feel of the packaging (white card board like texture). However, the quality of the  food made up for that. 5 stars for the wonderful bread, sauce, and lobster. 1 star taken off for the bad first impression of the packaging and no bag being offered.
My friend and I have been coming to the River Café for about 12 years now, always for a special occasion... yesterday was the first time we came for breakfast.  Service and attention to detail has always been exceptional and the view is breathtaking, no matter the time of day or weather.  My experiences wirh dinner and brunch have been great, however, with all that said, the actual breakfast quality and portions were underwhelming and left much to be desired. As a foodie, vacation rental host, tour director and former corporate events planner, I would not recommend breakfast here if you are looking for an exceptional meal.  Everything else, absolutely.  We too, reserved a table by the window, and then were told that it wasn't available when we arrived... our host handled it well, and thank goodness that we had the time and great weather to wait for our table, and our waitress was gracious enough to present us with a small, yet much appreciated, birthday presentation... logistically, I recommend that the cafe share their policy on the phone at the time a guest places the reservation. Please don't wait for them to have denied expectations... that leads to disappointment... not cool nor good for business.  Your restaurant is, and should remain, as a place people come to celebrate special moments. Please keep that in mind... with every single guest.  As far as presentation and portions... please consider having a conversation with the chef. Thank you.
I tried the pasta tasting menu at the bar on a Sunday night. The food, as anticipated, was very, very good. I was allowed to replace the agnolotti with the acclaimed beef cheek ravioli, which ended up being my favorite dish. I also enjoyed the black fettucine and the pappardelle bolognese. My least favorite dish was the olive oil cake and gelato--the olive oil cake wasn't warm and soft enough, while the gelato, which was perfectly creamy and topped with olive oil and sea salt, didn't yield the same pleasure after the first two bites.  Service was good, but the servers seemed to have a hard time remembering ingredients. The worst part of the experience included the music, which was too loud. I had expected an eclectic playlist, which there was, but it was loud and at times extremely disruptive while I was trying to enjoy and concentrate on intensity of flavors. Second, the bar seating was crowded, elbow-to-elbow. As the restaurant got busier, there were a lot of people pushing from behind, while seated near the door, I also got the cold draft.
If you like chinese food with sweet sauce then this is the place for you.  Mostly it is a place that caters to the American plate.  The steamed dumplings are large and have a sweet sauce on them.  We ordered some chicken dishes and again sweet sauce on it.  We ordered some spinach which was very bland with no taste.  The ribs and the snail dish were good.  I don't really see what the fuss is about for this place.  Yes, it is a hole in the wall and yes Anthony Baudoin loves it but no I am not going back, for me the food was not that great.
"This place is not great at all. The first thing that doesn't make sense here is the table arrangement. A few tables in the front and one lonnnnngggg table that cuts the restaurant. Then they have four tops? Wouldn't it be better to have 2 tops and combine them? The hostess seemed nice from far but she was very rude. When I asked for a table separate from ""farmer style"" she looked at me like I was stupid and she was like ""um what? What did you say?"" How do you speak to a customer like that? She goes ""anyway this is an Italian restaurant."" That has nothing to do with farmers style tables. She obviously has no idea what she's talking about and is super unprofessional, especially with the way she obnoxiously chews her gum. Your hostess is what gives your customer the first impression of the restaurant, and this definitely should NOT be her job. The waitress we had was HORRIBLE!! She pours our water and I ask for a bottle of still. I ask her to take the cups away and she goes ""NO I can't."" WHAT???? How can a restaurant have such bad customer service? While taking our order, she didn't even wait for us to finish and walked away!! What?? At this point it was obvious we were irritated and when my husband looked up, the hostess and the waitress were looking at us and talking about us. We were ready to leave when another waiter came up to us, and kindly asked us what happened. We explained and asked if maybe she was having a bad day? He told us ""yeah she was pretty wound up before you guys."" She was having a bad day, so we get the attitude? Not normal and unprofessional. The only high light was the waiter who came to check on us after her. He was really sweet. The food was really good, loved the pasta al limons with arugula and the fusilli al pesto was also amazing. Wish I could give more stars but very upset with the way things went."
Came here for lunch during the work week. It was crowded and had a line to get seated at a table. It was 3 of us around 12:15pm. Thankfully the wait was quick though, and the food came out fast. We were done and paid by 1:05. The weather was nice, so seating outside on Stone St. was perfect.  They only sell pizza by the pie, and they're a bit pricey because they can be. Pizzas are their signature rectangle with 10 slices. Can easily feed 3 hungry people or 4 with a medium appetite. We each had 2 slices and took 4 slices as leftovers. You can get half white pizza and half red for $3 extra. That's what we did, but I didn't realize that their white pizza actually means no sauce, not a creamy white sauce, which I had been looking forward to. Nevertheless, the pizza was great! We added their signature pepperoni ($3) on top, which was super yummy because they are the smaller, crispier kind. They also have some more interesting toppings like prosciutto, onion, and spinach. Crust is slightly thicker and baked to perfect level of soft inside and crispy outside. Only critique is I usually like my pizzas very heavy on the cheese, and theirs is not that cheesy.  Total price was about $40 including tax and tip. Definitely worth a try when you're in the Financial District!
"I was rather underwhelmed by my visit here.  Invited by a friend who has been here several times, even she was underwhelmed by her entree the night we went.  Restaurant is quite small and seats are very close together so if you are going to be discussing top CIA secrets, this may not be the venue for your chatter.  I didn't mind the seating because we were at the edge so it was easy to move about. Plus it was not that crowded while we dined.  I had a mocktail which I really enjoyed, it was cilantro limeade. Very refreshing. Appetizers were also very good- Senegalese rolls were wonderful. They had a kick of spice to them. My friend had the Tuna Tartare. Well it went down hill from there. We were both deciding between the Thiebou Jen or Dibi Senegal...we got 1 of each. My Dibi Senegal came with couscous but the meat was very disappointing. First it was dark in the restaurant, the table candles did not help me notice that the meat was charred on one side.  But my palate was still able to decipher that the meat was burnt on one side.  They need to improve the light, I mean who wants to eat in the bloody dark? Can I get a flash light so I can see my food? If you know how horrible the ""charred"" taste is in your mouth, well that's how horrible it was to eat the meat of the Dibi Senegal. One side looked good, the other side was charred. Very hard to enjoy. I left the meal there 3/4 uneaten, I was able to eat the couscous. I was asked if I wanted to take it home? For what?   The Thiebou Jen my friend ordered came with rice that was super salty. She actually returned it, spoke to the chef whom she was familiar with so they took that off the bill. Either way, very disappointed with the entree. I was looking forward to some senegalese meal but oh well. Can't win with every restaurant. My opinion is visit for drinks and apps, that's why I am giving it 3 stars"
This place delivers on everything but the bbq! Ambiance is great, decor is spot on, bar is well stocked with a great selection of bottles, they really took the time to make it pretty. The staff is excellent, well trained, they check up on you, and run a clean operation. When I walked in I didn't really smell any smoke, which was a bit off but I chalked it up to New York City and it's many ridiculous rules. Food was delivered a bit slowly, but that doesn't matter to me much. The presentation was nice and neat, but it wasn't bbq, and lacked in that department. The wings were good, buffalo sauce kept them together. Brisket was bland, but not dry. Sausage was reheated on a flat top or sauté pan and just tasted that way. Pulled was flavorless. If your looking for a nice clean place to unwind this is it, if your looking for bbq you are gonna be disappointed. Server was apologetic and warm, bill came to a little over $70 plus a $20 tip - good service - but I was overall disappointed with the food itself.
Best Thai food in the city! I've been here a couple times and was very pleased and satisfied with my experience. I ordered a few appetizers and chicken pad thai which was an amazing balance of fresh ingredients. By far the best pad thai I ever had. They also have a great bar and jot to mention the ambiance is amazing!!! Highly recommended!
Really good pizza! We got this recommendation from a friend to try it out. We first walked the Brooklyn Bridge, normal tourist stuff. Then afterwards we walked down to  Grimaldi's, which was about a block or 2 down the street. We had to wait in line, even if you wanted to order take out-it was that busy! But once we got inside & seated, we ordered & the food got to the table pretty quick! Grimaldi's is almost like a landmark after walking the Brooklyn Bridge. Not sure why the rating is so low. For sure a must!
Absolutely the best restaurant in the Arthur Ave. Section. (Little Italy). The food is always top notch and the staff always make my dining experience a pleasure.
I love this spot! I used to go all the time when I lived in the neighborhood. I stopped by again with my fiancé after years and it's still just as amazing just a totally different demographic.  The Cuban, corn, and catfish were all delicious. The sangria was ahhhhmazing, but don't let it sit too long bc it tastes way too strong after a while.  The decor is fun and welcoming and a real community vibe. Totally worth a visit!
The whole experience was pretty bad. Waiters are rude and disrespectful. He does not remember what we ordered, made several jokes outbursts also mocked another lady at the next table. The pasta is reheated, I ordered a Fetucinni with bolognese and it was the worst choice! When picking a table next to them a plate fell off my husband. Really the experience was horrible, do not go to this restaurant. ----- Toda la experiencia fue bastante mala. Los meseros son descorteses e irrespetuosos. No se recordaba de lo que habíamos ordenado, hizo varias bromas salidas de tono, además se burlaban de otra señora en la mesa de al lado. La pasta esta recalentada, pedí una Fetucinni con boloñesa y fue la peor elección! Cuando recogían una mesa de al lado se les cayo un plato encima a mi esposo. De verdad la experiencia fue horrible,NO vayan a este restaurante.
The carne asada taco was soooo good with the perfect amount of guacamole on top. I added some extra salsa which was provided on the counter top for patrons to just take as much as they want to put on their tacos! The pork taco was not nearly as good as the carne asada. It was saltier than I liked, but still a pretty darn good taco! I paid 7 something for them! Great deal!
Being the first Michelin star restaurant I have been able to enjoy in my lifetime I'd say Gramercy Tavern perfectly met my expectations in terms of the dining experience. Coming from a very large family the atmosphere at Gramercy Tavern reflects just that; a cozy and inviting home setting. The restaurant's wonderful usage of warm but dim lighting gives you a sense of that cliche yet enjoyable fireplace feel. The kitchen unlike most of the restaurants I have been too sat quite open and viewable from most sections of the restaurant. The noise level is low but not ultimately quiet and it very much invokes a sense of happiness in one to hear the chit-chat and laughter of other guests around you.  Beginning with the appetizer of smoked trout my tastebuds were delighted to not encounter the fishy taste of most restaurant-served seafood. It gracefully melts in your mouth along with the garnish of delicious scallions, kohlrabi, and roe that contrast with the smooth flavors of the fish. Stopping a second to note the amazing beverage recommendation from the waitress was a dry yet absolutely flavorful selection of Dupont, Brut de Normandie, France. Now onto the main course, the black bass, again I was met with melt-in-your-mouth quality and it was truly astounding. The rich and fresh ingredients that Gramercy Tavern uses will leave anyone astonished at how flavourful going the extra mile can be.  Finally, the only bump in the road was the final dessert course which left me and my companion underwhelmed. We ordered the cookie plate but were disappointed to find very common-like pastries and an apple pie that did not live up to a Michelin star restaurant.  Nonetheless, my experience with the staff and cuisine of Gramercy Tavern has put it at one of my top recommendations for anyone visiting New York that is looking for an upscale dining experience. I will without a doubt be returning to Gramercy Tavern in the future... hungry for more.
Had a Sunday date with a woman from France....., now living here in New York.  I'm from Chicago...., and know my 3rd biggest city in America quality in a good  Pizza. Pizza Quality = 7.5 The sauce in the pizza was good quality, with a balance of herbs, and parmesan cheese....,evenly proportioned throughout the Pizza. The sausage, green pepper, were well cooked well....,softened enough whereby it wasn't [ crunchy tasting ]...,and the tomatoes were finely chopped sprinkled throughout the Pizza. The Crust = 4  Too much dough..,mixed with the underlining ingredients. IN OTHER WORDS....,it felt like a sandwich...... Drinks = 6 Good choice in Beers.,and not to pricey either. My date, and I smuggled in some Grey Goose Vodka in some Water Canisters on Ice.   Yeah......,looks like water...,but IT'S NOT!  Ambience = 5 It's a good place for a date..., for about 1 hour, before you both walk in the SoHo neighborhood someplace., as this place is NOT for the loooooooong 2 hour at one place date scene.   It appears as if this joint has been here for decades, with it's vintage table's look.., however updating the interior is NOT on the list..,however the over-all quality of the Pizza, I'll give a 7.5.
Pizza is good but it's the rest of the menu that makes this place so good. Some may disagree, but that's where it's at. Be prepared to wait! Also, noisy and touristy, but I don't know another restaurant like it!
I'be been a couple of times for dinner and loved the food. Today I tried their brunch, they offer the mezze feast and a plate for 25$, that is more than enough to share between two people. The staff is friendly and the decor is very nice.
"When people ask me how it was here, considering it's a new spot on the island, I reply ""pretty bad,"" which is the most accurate. We came in the late afternoon during the week. The restaurant was pretty empty and a few bar stools were taken by older men, creepily hitting on the young bartenders who looked visibly uncomfortable at times. I know the whole point is to be Hooters-like and I'm sure creeps are part of the job, but management seemed to not notice when anyone was uncomfortable which seems problematic to me. We ordered drinks which were good. Food was just not. It was actually really disappointing. I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants like Applebee's, but I would choose Applebee's over Tilted Kilt 10 out of 10 times. Our waitress recommended the cluckin' something chicken sandwich which was like an entire chicken drenched in Frank's Red Hot in between two buns. We also got buffalo mac and cheese which we were all expecting to be delicious but it was literally buffalo chicken ON TOP of the mac and cheese. Weird? All pretty disappointing. It seems like a fine place to get your drink on, especially if you're a creepster."
This restaurant proves that in St. Mark if you fix up your place with trendy decor, music, and table wear, people would just pay for anything you serve. Honestly as a Chinese, I don't think their food is that good. It's really salty (or sweet), in very small proportion, and many dishes are way over priced. I can easily close my eyes and pick a restaurant in Chinatown, it'd taste better and with a fraction of the cost. Been here and feel very disappointed. Never coming back.
Came here with my friend and boyfriend by my friend's suggestion. When we got here, it was fairly crowded and we were told it would be a 20-30 wait. Well, we waited for almost an hour if not more for a seat. No communication or apologize from the hostess, but this is New York attitude compared to what I am used to in Washington. We were seated upstairs and seated. Our server was a very rude and rushing waiter. He made us feel like it was an interrogation when we asked questions or would just walk away when we were saying something to him. They also do not refill often. Portions are small and greasy. It was okay, better than Panda Express but I would hope so in NY and for those expensive prices. The soup dumplings were pretty good though. Definitely would advise a different location when I feel like eating Chinese food at the big apple.
Had a pretty solid culinary experience here with two other friends. It's not cheap, but the dishes are inspired and flavorful while maintaining a comfort food vibe. Here are the dishes I enjoyed: +Portobello mushroom tempura dumplings +buffalo-style frogs legs +strawberry baby back ribs +pork belly +baked muenster cheese +buffalo milk burrata cheese +foie gras +bacon doughnuts  It was more than enough food, especially with dessert and drinks. The tempura dumplings were the surprising favorite; the burrata and pork belly were also crowdpleasers. Great mixed drinks, too, and the pea soup that we were served as an amuse-bouche was awesome. Definitely would return here.
Nice and romantic atmosphere. Perfect for the date. Food is really really good but honestly it's not really that special for the price I paid which compare to many other authentic good Italian restaurant in NYC. But... Romantic atmosphere, extremely comfort Seats and crazy amount of hot people. Why not
Another pleasant experience at Root & Bone! We sat outside, which was wonderful but got chilly towards the end of our meal and our table could have lead to a disaster with one wrong move. It was tilted because of the concrete so we had to watch our drinks.  I had the rose cider, which is always so great and my date got a beer! We started with the biscuits- they are truly amazing. Our main was the half basket of fried chicken (4 big pieces), the cheddar waffles and Mac and cheese. Yay for some leftovers!  I tried the pineapple dessert- it's like a carrot cake but with pineapple. We also tried the coffee dessert cocktail; I was not super impressed.  Overall a great meal!
I would love to give this restaurant 3.5 stars but am rounding down because I found my meal satisfying in a decent/average way.  For antipasti, we ordered: TRECOLORI A selection of Italian cured meats and aged cheeses FRITTO MISTO A fried medley of calamari and shrimp garnished with fried zucchini and peppers served with our marinara or fra diavolo sauce CLASSICO An assortment of mushroom repiene, eggplant rollatine, clams oreganata and casino, and sautéed shrimp in a light tomato-white wine reduction CAESARE Our classic Caesare with shaved parmesano and garlic-rosemary croutons CAPRESE Fresh tomato, imported mozzarella di bufala and basil  The fried assortment was very heavy on the oil, almost soggy and not crunchy so not enjoyable. The Caesare salad and the TRECOLORI were also misses of the evening.  The Classico was served in a flavorful, classic red sauce. And the caprese was very good with fresh mozzarella. For entrees, we tried 2 chicken dishes which, despite the descriptions, were quite similar to each other. Both were doused in a gravy sauce but one had peppers and the other had sausage. Very disappointing as neither were tasty.  PICCANTE Spicy cherry peppers, garlic, onions, mushrooms in a demiglaçe-white wine reduction SCARPARIELLO Diced chicken breast sautéed with sweet Italian sausage in a delectable garlic, rosemary, olive oil and white wine sauce The pastas however were very good - SAFFRON PAPPERDELLE and LINGUINE NERE alla MONSIGNORE Both were seafood pasta dishes. The saffron was creamy tomato based and very tasty. The linguine was homemade black (squid ink) linguini with shrimp, scallops, squid, clams, and mussels in a light broth sauce.  Dessert was light with coconut sorbet and was refreshing and palette cleansing. Did not appreciate the rush to leave as our dinner was approaching the 2-hour mark. For a party of 8, the expectation should be average, not maximum 2 hours.
I did not think I would be saying this, in fact, so many other reviewers say the exact opposite, but I liked the uptown original Carmine's location better than this one.   Look, the menu is exactly the same and the service has been great at both.  This one clearly caters to a particularly touristy crowd as all times I have been there a tour bus has unloaded into the dining room.  I have NOTHING against tourists, BUT it does make for a noisier, more crowded and frantic feeling crowd.  Add to that the fact that you are in the middle of Times Square, which has it's own crazy energy and you start to feel kind of jumpy.   The uptown location, while also crowded is smaller and in a MUCH quieter part of town.  There, you can take some time and enjoy a meal with family as intended. On the other hand, the food is still great here, served family style with plenty to go around.  If you are in this area for a specific reason, and want to go somewhere close for a meal, then by all means, do.   If, on the other hand, you just want to try out the experience of dinner at a Carmine's restaurant, then definitely check out the original location uptown on Broadway!
This place is the epitome of a place where the food looks better than it tastes. The service was so bad that it made the mediocre tasting food even worse. It was the icing on the cake with our overall experience.  I'm astonished to see so many reviews and not sure if it's due to a lack of restaurants in the area that serve similar food? This place was just a passer by restaurant.  Our server was not attentive and was busy chit chatting away to take our order and we got our food north of an hour after we placed it where people who sat after us got their food, ate, and left before we even got our food.  The egg that was on the grain bowl was freezing cold and not even Luke warm. The fish tacos were tasteless and fell apart. The beet salad was mostly dressing and we left with our palettes spoiled and walked over to Chelsea market where we wished we got some of our appetite back to enjoy all the food there instead.
First time here, and there is no way to leave a tip when paying with a credit card. Food was great, but there are hundreds of POS systems available in this city, and to impair my ability to leave a tip for good service without having cash on hand is just not fair to the staff. Please fix the system, and I'll change my review. Thanks in advance.
#Staff - Great! #Food - Very mediocre; the bread was stale. #Nice Location - Nice bar. We would have been better off, if we stayed across the street @ Roll-N-Roaster; Overall a very limited selection of Italian food. I'm sure the Pizza would have been good, but you could just go to L & B.
I am so happy my Asian friends brought me here! The food is amazing!!!! I had the shrimp dumpling noodle soup. Also ordered The shenghai dumplings. Definitely coming back!!! Lunch time is the best.
Everything but the food is horrible . Wait time , customer service , waiter etc  Prepare to come with a lot of patience
A few girls friends and I popped in here on a weekday evening for a little BBQ. I wouldn't normally think to come down to Union Square for Korean BBQ, but this happened to be near all of us, so we gave it a shot. Since we made a reservation on Open Table (this also applies if you check in on yelp!), we got to spin the magic wheel out front. We got a free pickled veggie appetizer, which was pretty good. Each of us ordered a drink from their cocktail menu. I had the Wise Ol' Sage, which was very interesting. For food, we decided to share a the small Beef option. It included 4 or 5 cuts of beef and a few sides. It was enough to feed all four of us easily. We also got a scallion pancake to accompany our free veggie appetizer. For my first BBQ experience, the food and presentation were great. Ambience is cool. It's more of a pub on the first floor with TVs and a large bar. Upstairs is where the BBQs are and that setting is a bit more intimate. We were upstairs, and enjoyed the ambience. Service was ok. Our waiter was nice, but he wasn't terribly knowledgeable about the foods. We asked for a lot of recommendations since none of us had done this before, and we didn't feel like we got great advice.  Overall, Barn Joo delivered a fun Korean BBQ evening. I highly recommend coming here with a group and ordering the large, sampler platters. That way you can try a bit of everything. I'm looking forward to returning and trying some of the other dishes.
Came here after work with colleague months ago. Great selection and variety of cocktails, each with a cute legend on the menu/handbook, telling you the ingredients and taste. The place was loud and noisy even in the back where tables for small groups were set, but food was definitely of best quality. Still can't believe two girls finished all these plates plus 3 glasses of cocktail each on a weekday night lol.
In a city that has plenty of quality Italian restaurants Da Claudio is your local FiDi pit stop.  The food isn't there to blow you away, but it is there to fill you up with friendly people with a local vibe.  I've enjoyed three meals at Da Claudio and they're very consistent with nice people and a decent meal.  The wine list definitely needs some work, but overall it provides good value for money and is worth stopping in.
"The table of four next to us stiffed their servers. ""No tip,"" the customers said, ""because we had to ask for water, and we didn't have spoons.""  Are you kidding me, cheap-o tourists? Do you understand what was just given to you? You just got a group meal of some of the best xiao long baos in NYC for under $40 and now you don't want to tip? That's like someone giving you a pirate's treasure chest full of gold and you're mad because they didn't smile. The servers put diamonds on your plate and served them to you at $6.50 a pop. And you're mad you didn't get spoons? Eat those diamonds with your hands, you sillies.  Also, just think about it, these servers bring these hot and steamy trays of delicious pork soup dumplings to your table without burning themselves or you in the process. And a 10% tip is just $0.65 per tray. That's the least you could do. I mean, I always tip at least 20% because I'm classy like that. At joints like this, the food is so cheap, it's another $4 to make it 20%; the servers are working for pennies here.  Nan Xiang is my favorite place to get pork dumplings in NYC. There, I said it. Nowhere in Manhattan can you get this quality of dumplings for the price. The delicate, perfectly balanced noodle skins wrap the juicy pork that is just loaded with savory soup. (No, they're not as good as Din Tai Fung, but they are not far off).  The green onion pancake is just okay--a little too deep fried for my taste. It's better with the beef in it, because it balances out the fried crispy texture.  The garlic cucumbers are good and refreshing. The pork and pickled cabbage noodle soup was good, but probably needed more pork and less cabbage. Broth and noodles were nice though.  The beef noodle soup and the soy milk are all just okay. Nothing spectacular, but can definitely satisfy a craving.  Skip: jellyfish (mostly has other veggies to compensate for not having enough jellyfish). So, just to recap: Don't expect good service. Don't expect them to bring bowls with your soup. But, expect soup dumplings that warm your heart (and are pretty easy on your wallet!)"
La mein was good  The soup tastes really good.  However, I cannot try the don (rice) and I could not find the fried chicken wing on the menu.
This place has amazing Greek food. The staff is so friendly I tipped the hell out of them. Can't get it wrong going there.
You can never go wrong at Almar. The food is always good, never had a bad meal here. The staff is friendly and the hostess very pleasant. Probably the best place to eat in Dumbo. The only criticism I can think of is they only take cash. If they took credit I'd give them 5 stars.
Would give 0 stars of available. Service was horrendous, focusing solely on their friends and ignoring everyone else. We  had to get up and leave it was so bad.
I've been going to purbird regularly for about a year now and I like it a lot. But there's been a recent change which really upsets me. The owner has made tipping cash only, significantly reducing the tips the staff makes.  It's the 21st century and people want to pay and tip with cards and phones far more than cash. The guys at purbird work hard and wear genuine smiles. To squeeze their tips for a few percentage points of credit card fees seems nothing but greedy.  These guys are the face of the company, it's in management's interest that they are as happy as possible. Reducing their ability to receive tips is counter-productive. It can only have the effect of reducing their incentive to be as friendly as possible.  The staff deserve whatever the customer wants to tip them, and the customer deserves to pay a tip in whatever way they want.  In the end, this rule really affects the customers. Almost everyone wants to tip via credit card, so let them! I hope the owner of purbird will listen to the customers.
"3.5 stars I ventured pretty far to find Hothouse, which is easy to miss because there's no real sign (I had to peer at the newspaper articles to make sure I had found the right place). After hearing great things about their hot chicken, I had high expectations. Unfortunately, I found it underwhelming. The food isn't bad, but it doesn't match the hype and raving reviews.  Started with an order of fried green tomatoes - I've had better elsewhere. There wasn't enough crunch or flavor. The shrimp and grits were pretty good, a lot more depth of flavor in this dish. I tried all levels of the chicken, and personally didn't have too hard of a time eating a few bites of the ""extra hot."" For a more enjoyable plate that you can actually finish, order the regular or hot; the extra hot is good for sharing unless you want to risk stomach ulcers (not worth the pain). The chicken itself is good but nothing stood out - it wasn't very juicy or crunchy, just normal. My favorite sides were the collard greens, slaw, and mashed potatoes. Skip the loaded baked grits which sound more tasty than they are. Was it worth the trip? Probably not. If you're around the area, it's a fun place to check out. But don't expect to be blown away - go with the mindset of having some pretty good Southern food in a casual setting."
I expected this place to be fantastic, but it was just good Thai food. I went for the lunch special and ordered the Kea-Mao and it wasn't super flavorful or extraordinary, but it was cheap and I guess that's what really matters. Reserve a spot around lunch time because it gets super busy!
"Four Star attributes: Great decor and ambiance. Feels very hip and fitting of the new DUMBO. Went with my guy's family and they were all very pleased with how ""Brooklyn"" it looks - comfortable with good service and good drinks.  Three Star attributes: the food was decent, but nothing that blew me away. The salads were tasty and the crostini were good, but the pasta dishes left me wanting more. The panne cotta was definitely lacking - way too sweet, don't recommend it. If they brought their food up to the look of the place they would be solid! But because it was just decent and still pricy, I'm going with a three over all.  Also, take advantage of their buy-one-get-one-free happy hour, if you arrive just before six (but beware, the kitchen doesn't open until 6)."
I don't know what all the hype is about for this place. I ordered the Shakshuka and it was watery and the eggs were overlooked. The sauce also lacked flavor. The Bloody Mary was spicy and pretty decent but I wish the food was better.
I came here after work one day for dinner. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen which was just ok. Noodles were overly hard and flavor was just normal compared to other places I've been. It wasn't bad, but there wasn't anything noteworthy that I would go back for.
I was anticipating our visit but was let down by mediocre food. Came for lunch time and some dishes were great, but some were thumbs down.  *Kaisen don set: Fresh pieces of sashimi over seasoned rice. Good variety fish and quality was quite good. Cold soba noodles came out kind of sticky and over cooked. Not sure if it was because we came at 1:30pm for lunch service, but noodles were not cooked well!  --Tempura soba: Comes with 4-5 pieces of tempura. Well battered and cooked. Soba broth was extremely salty. Didn't have that dashi taste or hearty broth either. Seemed like they just scraped it out of a big pot. Soba noodles kept on breaking as I tried to eat them, indicating that they are either overcooked or old? Thumbs down on this one!  Additionally, the miso soup was very dark in both color and taste. This too was way too salty and seemed like we got the tail end of the pot.  Service was good and although some parts of our meal was okay, some dishes were not. I would like to come back, but based on my previous experience, I am saddened :(
One of the few places open around noon on a weekday in the area. Gotta get that free Thai ice tea checking in even though it was a lot of ice and small, but it's free and it wasn't too sweet, which I like. Ordered the black pepper beef, summer roll, curry roti, 5 spiced fried calamari, cha siu bun ( u have a choice of pork or chicken, I got pork) and shrimp cashew something... forgot the full name but it was under the Thai cuisine entree.  Black pepper beef and summer roll was ok, not amazing. Curry roti was yummy, my favorite was the spicy calamari. Was very flavorful and calamari wasn't tough to chew, the batter was airy and crispy. Shrimp cashew dish was very greasy at the bottom, layer of oil and it had a good amount of shrimps and cashew, not too spicy and heavy curry taste (chunks of curry paste). Meat of the pork buns were tough, taste was good but meat was chewy. The waiter had no smile and looked like he didn't want to serve us. There was also a huge argument between the delivery man and the guy at the counter, didn't understand why but they were slamming the bags of orders on the table and screaming in the middle of the restaurant. It escalated quickly when the counter guy shoo the delivery man out and flipped a table. Chef had to come out to break it, I couldn't enjoy my lunch with my friend with this drama and there was no apology.
Don't go here for lunch specials the portions are extremely tiny overpriced and they have very little to offer as well the beef that I ordered was extremely rubbery and either overcooked or really low-quality don't go here this place sucks and the service is not good either. I had to order two portions because I don't eat rice to get slightly filled up and the portions are just so tiny you can't get filled up on even two.
AMAZING BRUNCH!!! 10/10 would recommend. I've been to Calle Ocho for brunch many times and it's always so fun/delicious.  Bottomless sangria with the purchase of any meal and lasts for as long as you have food on your plate. There was 6 of us and we got 3 Gallitos, each of which is more than enough food for two and is around $30.  For a delicious meal and bottomless sangria, $15 per person is incredible!  Especially in NYC! Make sure you try the strawberry butter they serve with the bread basket at the beginning of the meal, it's out of this world!!!
Ok, but not amazing. If you're a vegetarian there's 2 options for you on the menu.   I got the Chile Rellen which was $18, way too pricey for a pepper stuffed with cheese with tomato sauce on top.   There was nothing really special about it, except that it was stuffed with cheese (you'll feel it afterwards), but I don't think the cheese warrants the price tag.   Guacamole (lacking flavor) was $12.  Ouch. It doesn't even come up with enough chips to finish the guacamole.  I'm not asking for endless chips like Chi-Chi's, but a few more would be great.   We finished the few totopos (which were good) and then was left with half a bowl of guacamole left.  Sadly when they were putting our entrees on the table, another waiter sneakily whisked our remaining half of guacamole away before I could ask them to keep it on the table. Pros:  We got a table at 7PM with no problem.  There didn't seem to be a big wait.  The restaurant is pretty. Servers are attentive, including with water refills.
As far as brunch goes, this restaurant should be considered a good standby. Easy for reservations and large groups, with attentive staff.  They also have a variety of bloody Mary's (I tried the Oaxaca one with mescal) followed by the huevos rancheros. Eggs were nicely runny in the middle and overall sauce wasn't too spicy.  My meal ended up being very Mexican influenced but their menu has all the brunch staples - French toast, burgers, BLTs etc.  Not amazing but a consistent standby.
"Zero stars! Walked out on our bill when we were told that they repurpose food. Do not patron this place!!! Walked in the door and immediately got nasty attitude and a sarcastic hi 5 from the manager. They told us it would be a 15 min wait and then we were seated in a empty restaurant 5 min later.  My friend ordered iced coffee and the server brought him an empty coffee cup with an ice cube in it then poured hot coffee over it. Wtf? I ordered a latte, my cup came less than half full. I said ""this cup is half full?"" To which the waiter said ""yep"" and walked away.  BEST PART My wife ordered a salad and asked for no bacon because she is a pescatarian. They brought the salad with bacon! Ok no big deal mistakes happen, we asked them to please bring a new salad and to not simply take the bacon out. THEY HAVE AN OPEN KITCHEN I WATCHED THE KITCHEN STAFF TAKE THE BACON OUT!!!  When I complained to the manager he appeared to care when we ran off to the kitchen. Only problem was that we watched him go and pick up the same salad that was de-baconed and tell us that it's a brand new salad and that he just watched them make it.  Furthermore, the manager was simply just a jerk and rude. He mocked my wife and talked down to us.  Needless to say we walked out on a $120 bill and a table full of uneaten food."
"Proof that good food does not make a good restaurant... Environment: ""Industrial Chic""... a bit outdated feeling, but a nice enough place to dine.  Except for one thing: the music. Testing the limits of the speakers, the ear-splitting music left us wondering if we had indeed gone to a restaurant or if, in a moment of confusion, we had ended up at the club. And if we had, indeed, ended up at the club, it was a tacky joint two bridges over in that other lovely state. In a hopeful moment I heard the familiar melody Queen and David Bowie's ""Under Pressure,"" only to be shocked into the realization that it was in fact Vanilla Ice's sampling of the song in his embarrassing classic ""ice ice baby."" Service: Upon arrival, I was sent to the bar for a drink while I waited for the rest of my party. My cocktail tasted watery, as if it had been made an hour before and left sitting (though I saw it being made). I inquired about the flatness of the cocktail and was asked ""would you like more tonic in it?"" Not once did the bartender as me if I even liked the drink or if I'd like to try something else, or even to simply explain why the drink tasted like water. And like drinking water, I emptied my glass in a few minutes and $15 later (I left a dollar tip) headed to the table with my friends. While our waitstaff were nice enough, their tables were certainly not their priority for the evening. They would lackadaisically check in with us now and again, but only when we were getting thoroughly frustrated waiting for them. We had to ask to have the music turned down every 5-10 minutes, and the volume would decrease slightly only to come back twice as loud at the next song. The expediter brought the food out and explained everything beautifully. Otherwise, the service was unbelievably unprofessional for a $$$ restaurant.  Food: I give the chef a lot of credit. The food was unique and fresh, at times beautifully simple, while other times a bit more inventive and unexpected. Some of the dishes had a distinctly home-made middle-eastern feeling, while others were fairly interesting chef-driven experiments. And I have a lot of respect to an Israeli chef who will label Syrian cheese as such and not try to appropriate it as ""Israeli"" food, as so many others have done. Food politics aside, or perhaps another kind of food politics, the farm-to-table approach is evident in the quality and freshness of ingredients. The food gets 4 stars for me. Not mind-blowing, but good. The wine list is pricey, especially for this part of Brooklyn, and based on the quality of the lower priced wines, the mark-up is probably extreme. I will likely never return to this place. Overall, and thanks to the staff, it was such a disappointing dining experience."
When there for lunch. The menu was small, southern comfort-ish - I had the chicken fried steak dish. The biscuit was dry (not homemade) and the two pieces of fried steak with poached eggs was small (but filling) the sausage gravy was ok.  My buddies both had chicken waffle. It was not very good as the chicken breast was dry and the waffle was not served with syrup but rather a spicy sauce.  The atmosphere was great - the bar looked pretty amazing from the top of the house. Its a nice find near the world trade center - but I'd go there for drinks vs. food.
"My first meal after my long journey here and it sure hit the spot! The menu seemed pretty basic at first but the tiny section in the back had a wonderful selection of soup and dry noodles. The  Krabi Seafood noodle soup caught my eye, more specifically the warning at the bottom of it did. Apparently they need to warn people it's not for ""novices"" and I agree. The waitress even warned me again after I ordered it and emphasized that I cannot ask to return it.  While it's not super out there if you're familiar with Asian cuisine, the flavor from the fermented tofu will still catch you off guard a bit if you don't know what you're getting yourself into. I grew up eating fermented tofu but when it's in a tomato broth and the sourness kicks in, it'll definitely wakes your taste buds up. The flat rice noodles were perfect in it. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and there was plenty of seafood and white fungi to make it a more hearty meal. I got the medium spicy and it was the perfect amount where I didn't need to drink water but I felt the heat a bit. I also got a Thai Tea which is your basic Thai Tea. It's good but nothing super crazy. Service was also excellent. Only sad part was that they don't take reservations so even at 9:30pm on a weeknight we still had a 30 minute wait. Overall, it's definitely a delicious spot to stop by for some good Thai food."
Look for my man Peter, one of the friendliest staff I've ever met!  I had the uncle phuck's dumplings to start and rendang nasi lemak with beef as my main course. The dumplings came with a great peanut sauce that came together when paired with Sriracha. My main course wasn't anything special, until I mixed everything together and devoured it. There was a small dollop of this delicious chili sauce/oil that I wish there was more of. It was tangy with a spicy kick. The pickled carrots and radishes were a good refreshment to the dish.
I come here often; far too often.  Honestly if I checked in enough you would probably see this as at least a twice a month thing not by my choice but my mother's choice. After today I have had enough and will not be returning.  You might still catch my mother making her way here (I would hope not).  It wasn't busy today, BUT they were catering to a party downstairs which is why we were seated and left to die of thirst.  I called over a server (who did not seat us) and he told us that our server was very busy...was that supposed to be an excuse as to why we were waiting 15 minutes? I made my complaint and proceeded to give my entire order so I could just kill 2 birds with 1 stone.  I might have been a little rude, I will not lie, but the server was really nice and took down my order.  It really wasn't his fault that whoever was supposed to take care of us left us stranded.  I've noticed when the owner isn't there, neither is the service. I had shared with my mother: causa de pollo (super bland, flavorless), empanadas (super salty), arroz chaufa (flavorless as well, chicken was too hard to bite into) and a ceviche (the fish has not been bathed in lemon juice for the amount of time it should have been). Overall I could say the best thing I had from this visit was the water.  My mother even told the waiter (kindly) that the food was too salty or flavorless and the waiter said he would let the chef know; ouch!  My mother asked the waiter if it was a new chef because she knows all too well that this wasn't the cooking of the person who has prepped the food in prior visits here. This is the last time I will be seeing Pio Pio, there are far too many Peruvian restaurants opening up for me to continue being disappointed with the quality of food.  Good riddance!
Another very good Italian spot right right by Museum Mile.  I went there with my parents who live around the corner a couple times and was amused by the bento box lunch special--yes, with Italian food.  hahaha  I'm pretty sure I had a salad last time I went there and it was pretty good.  I think Centolire around the corner is better, but Caffe Grazie is decent.
"This used to be my go-to spot until what happened during my last time here.  YOU HAVE A THIEF AMONGST YOUR STAFF.   Came here for a small get together for a friend who just came back from Russia who brought us little bottles of vodkas. We left the bar to walk across the street to Shady Lady where we realized we forgot our bottles of vodkas. We ran back to retrieve them and there was only one bottle left on the table which was recovered by the staff. What happened with the other bottle? Asked a short Hispanic guy about it and his response was ""YOU WANT ME TO LOOK IN THE GARBAGE?"" I want to be clear here: I only asked him if he had seen the other bottle. I never asked him to search the garbage. Then we were pretty much ignored by the rest of the staff. No one offered to search for it. I told the bouncer my story and even he agrees that someone took it.  More specifically he thinks that the short Hispanic guy either took it or drank it himself because of his response.  Sweet Afton--this is how you lose customers. I'm telling this story to everyone I know."
"I have always wanted to try Katz to see what the hype was all about. I did some research and was shocked at prices, but thought I'd give it a try anyway. The guy making our sandwich was great. We told him we were from out of town and it was our first visit. He gave us 4 huge slices of pastrami to sample. He also recommended what type of sandwich to get and how to get it. We decided on the pastrami on a white roll with swiss cheese. Very good sandwich and great portion size. I initally thought $21 for one sandwich, and not including a side or 2, was crazy, but the portion was huge. We shared a sandwich and my wife wasn't able to finish her half. The pastrami sandwich was well worth the price.  Everything else was extremely disappointing. We ordered baked beans for our side, sold separately. They literally tasted like they just opened the can, placed them in a warmer and scooped them in a cup. For $6 I was expecting some onion, green pepper, or something else that would make ""Katz baked beans"" and worth the price. My wife took them back to replace with fries and was given grief by one of the workers. He said we ordered them 30 minutes prior to bringing them back. That was strange, because the others in our group still hadn't received their food and the cup more than 3/4 full. The fries were very pedestrian ($7). Just your standard, cookie-cutter frozen fries. Fortunately they replaced the beans with fries and didn't charge us.  All in all, my Katz experience was good. I would definitely consider going back.  Quick reiview: 1. Pastrami sandwich was off the chain 2. Let them know you're a newcomer to get the samples  3. Skip the sides- at least the baked beans and fries"
I was so excited about visiting, but the hostesses and servers were not so excited about my visit. Apathetic service from start to finish.  The food was decent, but a bit bland and overpriced for what it was.  Lastly, the bartender should probably be replaced.  One star for the charming decor/ambience.
The food is solid, the lines are long, the waitress (female ones) are amazing the host (tall chubby one) is the worst. We didnt mind the 30-40 minute wait for a table, we figured since there's a wait the food must be amazing. When we finally got seated the waiters brought our side dishes and we ordered fairly quickly everything was going great, the bibimbap was delicious and crunchy, the tofu soup was one of the best ones i had (i ordered the seafood one) their pancakes were crispy and there was seafood in every bite LITERALLY! There was one waitress who was super sweet and lovely and our dinner was perfect until the end. We had wanted to take the leftovers to go and they gave us containers and cleared the table we had a CUPCAKE with one candle to blow out and we already asked for the bill AND GAVE THEM OUR CREDIT CARD the rude guy came back with our receipt and our credit card in hand which he had not swiped yet and left it on our table and said theres people waiting for a table... HELLO?!? we PAID not our fault you cant seem to take two seconds to look down and SEE that you are holding our credit card.. IF YOU HAD SWIPED AND COME BACK WITH THE RECEIPT we would have been out of there, so WHILE we were waiting to get the receipt having you come back and harass us for that extra minute because we decided to blow out a candle on a cupcake did not help speed things up. The food was good but NOT that good where I would come back due to that incident. We were not holding anyone up, we had requested the receipt and handed them our credit card already so I dont appreciate the nasty attitude making us seem like we are at fault when you are the one who cant seem to check us out properly. Quality over quantity, at this rate I don't see this place maintaining such high review on yelp. And if you are coming here for any occasion I would skip it. Dont let their nasty male host (tall chubby guy) ruin your night, I have seen other reviews who claimed to have the same thing happen to them. Honestly it wasnt even a cake it was a cupcake so I didnt understand the fuss. The service at the end left a sour taste in my mouth so i will NOT be back. Do not recommend. There are plenty of other restaurants JUST AS GOOD WITH better hostess. P.S dont order the fried pork... was not good and we left it untouched AND didnt even bother taking it to go cause it just wasnt good. (looks like salt and pepper pork to me)
I totally fall in love with Barn Joo after my 1st happy hour here! We had happy hour oysters, chicken wings, truffle fries, calamari and cocktail!  The food was amazing with affordable prices. The staff were so nice with excellent service. It's hard to believe you could find this quality of service and food with such a friendly price in this neighborhood.
Such a lovely place... bartenders are obnoxious and who has ever heard of a place with no napkins!!!!
"We went this place for second time. We had Thai chicken fried rice, the rice was so hard and a couple slices of chicken. I mentioned to servers about the rice, he was like ""oh yes"" and that was it. We also ordered green curry with Thai pasta, but they forgot to give us pasta. Then I asked to server and gave later on. The restaurant wasn't busy that time.      This review is for improve their food quality and services. I've been eating Thai foods all my life as I grew up in Udon Thani and Bangkok. I used to like K-79 when we went last time but this time. !"
I had such a great experience here! We sat down right away table for two on a Monday at 3pm. Food: the chicken waffle classic was tasty! Shared it with a friend. The waffles were good and they had 3 different cream cheese you can choose from. The chicken itself wasn't anything spectacular, I feel like it's like Popeyes except even more fried. It was so fried and we had two pieces. One drumstick and one breast. Drumstick was mostly fried skin so I didn't eat that part. I wouldn't order it again because I can probably make it at home and it would be cheaper and less fried. But worth the first try!  Vibe: very warm they blast up the heat so you are cozy even when it's super windy outside in October. Great music they were playing CHANCE the whole time love that!! Service: there was a lady with blue hair serving us she was so sweet, funny, and took time to help us choose because we didn't know what to order! She had a great smile and sense of humor (we are both indecisive) haha  Price: I think it was about 18$ pre tip and tax which is quite pricy Location: it's surrounded by so many good places like black tap, Katz Deli, lab , and vegan ice cream place. Hot spot Ludlow!!! Next to a coffee shop that has WiFi.  Great experience !
Taste-wise - is pretty good.  Taste alone would probably get 3.5 stars, but there's too much MSG in the soup.  And the food tends to be on the sweeter side, a little too sweet for me, but Shanghainese food tends to be sweeter to begin with. Slightly on the pricy side, given that portions are a bit small.  But is a non-tipping restaurant, so given that, is still a little bit on the pricy side, but not as bad as I initially expected.
Slick ambience hides the many drawbacks of the newcomer to Park Slope. The waiters are polite but disorganized and spend way too much time chatting amongst themselves rather than looking after guests. But my main complaint is about the food. I have traveled in Turkey and tasted some of the freshest and most delicious food. This restaurant serves a pale imitation in comparison - food that is simply too rich (cream, butter, mayonnaise) and sterile. It tastes like it was pre-cooked and heated just before serving.
This place is pretty horrible. Service was meh but the wings were good. The cream corn was super watery and it felt like it was microwaved.  Anyways, we arrived like around 11pm cause we were craving wings and they close at 1am. But when we arrived they said it was last call.. the guy didn't look too happy and was giving us attitude. We didn't get our water refilled nor getting checked up if everything is fine. So we ate our wings quick and asked for the check and box. We had to ask for a box twice cause I guess the first guy didn't want to do it. When they finally boxed it up for us, they just threw it on the table.  Overall, I won't be coming back to this place. Horrible service and I don't get how they have 4 stars.
Second visit to Red Rooster as a friend from London wanted to visit the sights of Harlem. Definitely the best cornbread I've had anywhere in NYC and we shared an entrée of the chicken which came with mash and greens. The chicken was well cooked and seasoned with a nice crispy crunchiness to it.  First time visited was a Sunday evening when they had a jazz band playing and place was busier rather then a weekday lunchtime, that time was sat nearer the pass so enjoyed the theatre of watching the chefs at work one side and the band behind me. Lunchtime had a different vibe but still a pleasant one and every server had their own sense of style, fortunately we had the coolest dude which enhanced the Harlem day out. Mulling over four stars or three, the food is definitely four stars but I felt some of the prices are higher then they need to be so making it a three, perhaps I'm being mean. Will leave it to the readers to visit and decide if they think its a 3,4 or 5 star experience for them. A third future visit is called for to help me recalibrate my scoring more firmly.
My BF had spotted this around Xmas and wanted to take me here. It definitely had a nice vibe & cozy yet trendy decor. The drinks had to be sent back because there was barely any alcohol in it... And was $15. The food was mixed. We decided to try the ricotta bruschetta w/honey & smoked seat salt. I love ricotta, but it was a bit overwhelming & was just this giant glop of cheese on toasted bread that was blah... My brown butter gnocchi was delicious... Made with braised lamb shoulder, ricotta, toasted hazelnuts, & piave. It was very soft & tasty!  My BF's lasagna al forno was ok. He would've preferred a more traditional lasagna in Little Italy w/more sauce, but at least the pasta was al dente pasta & had nicely melted/baked cheese. The roasted cauliflower w/capers & walnuts was a bit soggy... Not quite roasted or fried, which is what we thought it was.  And was $11? The ambiance was good and service was attentive. The food was mixed like we said, overall too expensive for the quality of food.
Way overprice poke bowl place! $16 dollar for a regular size of poke bowl, other place only sell around 10-12. I bet the cost of this bowl only $1-2. Food was very mediocre, space was limited during rush hours.
Been a while since I visited Vanessa's and it's a bit disappointing that they raised the prices of the dumplings over the past few years. I'm a big fan of dollar dumplings. Four or five dumplings for $1? Keep em' coming, I will stuff myself silly with that oily goodness. Just keep it under that $0.25/dumpling ratio and we're golden, like the bottom of a nice fried dumpling kind of golden. But now you're telling me I have to pay $1.50 to get just 4 measly dumplings that are like 70% dough? You're good, but you're not THAT good. YOU'VE CHANGED! WHO EVEN ARE YOU ANYMORE VANESSA!? Honestly though, Vanessa's still has decent dumplings and a wider range of choices on their menu compared to others (sesame pancake is good). But if you want more dumplings per dollar, there are a couple of actual dollar dumpling places in Chinatown if you look around.
We came in from vegas and were looking for a nice, relaxed atmosphere to eat/drink. This place kinda threw me back at first because it was super packed and there was a 40-min wait. We ended up waiting for about 30 minutes and it cleared up a bit by the time we were seated. After that, it was perfect. The employees were great and the foooood omg the food! It was so good! The fried rice was the best. Definitely recommend it and will return when I head back to new york. My inner chubbs was happy
I ordered an arugula and goat cheese salad. The salad had about two specks of goat cheese and three almonds. I paid 11 bucks for arugula in a bowl. My friend ordered the meat loaf special. I don't know if it was because we took the food to go that they gave us such poor qualify for overpriced food. The meatloaf was Burnt. The mash potatoes were good though as well as the gravy. Definitely not worth the 28 bucks that was spent.
I seriously cannot believe I hadn't discovered this place earlier! From the ambience to the food, everything is a delight! As soon as I walked in, I got a serendipity 3 feel from the restaurant. The decor is antic, and every awkward piece perfectly complements the other.  Coming down to the food, my friend and I both ordered the honey chili quarter dark fried chicken. The chicken came with a side of your choice, along with a biscuit and a side of salad with the most wonderful dressing on it! We also got an order of macaroni and cheese to share. Initially i was going to get mac and cheese as my choice of side, but for some reason they stopped serving mac and cheese as a side order, instead you have to end up buying the full entree size, bummer. As far as quality of food goes, it was amazing! You get large portions, and even though the menu says you get 1 thigh and 1 drum stick, it actually comes with two drumsticks which was a pleasant surprise. The biscuit was so soft and buttery and absolutely melts in your mouth! I got a side of sweet potato fries, which I wouldn't recommend because it tastes just like regular fries. However, the macaroni and cheese is a must! We ordered the sugar freak mac and cheese which was delicious! Coming down to dessert, the menu was actually pretty upsetting. They don't have a large variety of options to choose from, so I ended up skipping dessert. However, my friend ordered the beignets and she thoroughly enjoyed it. Definitely recommend this place to everyone!
We liked this place so much that we went twice!  The first time we stopped by for a quick brunch before a show. We had the Mac & Cheese and the New York Poutine. Both very good. On our second visit, during an evening, the bartenders here were fabulous - especially Noel. Very friendly, without being over the top - and super knowledgeable. While we just had appetizers, what we had was delicious - glazed meatballs and an everything pretzel.  I would definitely go back next time I'm in NYC!
I love Thai food and I loved Chiang Mai when it was open for that hot sec in Red Hook so I had to go to Ugly Baby when I read they were affiliated. The great ratings from others are accurate! The food here is so flavorful, perfectly spicy and portioned well. There was a little bit of a wait on Friday evening when we went and it was a little hard trying to get someone's attention to get on the list bc there's no host stand but once we got seated service was quick and good. We ordered the black bean muffins, the turmeric fried fish, the pork shoulder and the ground pork in peanut sauce with noodles. The fried fish was crispy and well seasoned, served with lemon to squeeze over the top. My husband's pork shoulder with glass noodles was spicy and flavorful. The pork was tender and not too fatty. I loved the ground pork and peanut sauce dish. The noodles are the perfect vehicle to the thick peanut sauce! I wasn't sure if I would like the black bean muffins (my husband's selection) but they came out hot and with a sweet and sour sauce that made them a great appetizer. We brought wine bc the restaurant doesn't have their own liquor license, others saw and made runs to the store while waiting for their seats. Highly recommend!
i used to think corn was okay, but after eating a grilled cuban corn with cheese and seasoning, i didn't think i would love corn even more! this is a must try item, you will not regret it! my friends and i came here to get a snack so we can save our stomachs for dinner, but i wish we had bought more corn haha. i would definitely come back here if i was visiting new york again.
Unfortunately I was disappointed. We ate here a couple years back and really enjoyed it, but this time wasn't so great. We ordered the Pad Thai and it was so bland, almost tasted like tomato sauce. With all the places to eat in NYC, this wasn't one of our favorites.
Fantastic ramen!  So tasty!  We were quoted a 45 min to 1 hour wait, which only ended up being about 25 minutes.
So whenever I mention Glasserie to my friends who are really in the food scene, they always talk about how they haven't been since the original chef departed. Well I went the other night for the first time, and I was thoroughly impressed. Those friends of mine should definitely consider coming back.  I just moved to the neighborhood and already see this place becoming a standby for me. I thought it was just as good if not better than Bar Bolonat, which is getting so much press these days. I got the Syrian Cheese, chicken kibbe, lamb entree, and the squid stew. All stellar. Same with that buttery bread and lebneh. Everything killed. I think the price point is a couple bucks more expensive than I would expect for Brooklyn, especially in such a tucked away industrial corner (the space is beautiful though)... but still, it's not going to keep me from coming back. Need to try brunch next!
This is an amazing place ,the menu is simple just as the name burgers and Lobster but was way better than what I expected it to be, great drinks, environment and very friendly staff!
Poke is cheap/decent enough that I've eaten here half a dozen times+, but service is downright bad.  4 problems in last 5 visits: - Requested aioli on the side (aioli and dressing both mixed in) - Same request (again aioli mixed in, this time dressing left on side) - Same request. Cashier doesn't understand what aioli is this time so I try to explain (aioli is listed ingredient on wall menu behind counter). Cashier goes to kitchen for further explanation, comes back and puts in the order.  I'm all cool with language barriers but the ingredients on your own menu should not repeatedly be a point of misunderstanding. Food turns out fine this time. - Tonight: kitchen either gave my to go order to wrong customer or just trashed my ticket. After 15 minute wait, cashier realizes I'm still waiting and offers me wrong order. I confirm my order then he and the kitchen search for my ticket. They find it and spend another 15+ minutes making my food. After 30 minutes! of waiting I'm in line to just get a refund and say good riddance when one of the young girls from the kitchen finally brings it out and says thanks.  No explanation or apology at any point. I was ready to take a refund and leave the food anyway by that point, but didn't feel like waiting to get to the front of the line or causing a scene over $15.  ***Update*** I just opened the food from tonight's order.  Aioli is mixed in again, but there's extra on the side. Can't make this up. ***Update 2*** Owner/mgr offered to make up for the terrible service outlined above by refunding the meal, however they did not follow through and I see now that they charged the full amount for ruined food.  No refund.  Diner beware!
"Honestly the best pizza I have ever had! This restaurant is located in a fun hip area of the Financial District. It's on Stone St, which is LITERALLY a stone street surrounded by many other bars/restaurants. :) Wasn't too hard to get seated, but the place filled up fast! Started off with a craft of the house red. It was a great value and tasted pretty good. The ""Old Fashioned Pie"" is a large square pizza, could probably feed 3-4 people. With a party of two, we opted for the smaller 10"" round pizzas, which was perfect. They gave us bread, which I though was okay.  We ordered the BARESE - which has sausage and onions. The crushed red peppers are extremely spicy! I felt the kick with only 2-3 shakes!! It had amazing flavor. I thought that the customer service was great, they were friendly, provided us with wine/water-refills/bread/pizza pretty quickly. I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you are in NYC!"
It was a Saturday night, and the place was packed. We came here for a friend's birthday party. The calamari appetizer was yummy and worth getting. We got 2 orders of it for a party of 12. I got the beef nasi lemak for my entree. It was average. The jasmine rice was extremely hard which I hated. The beef sauce was ok. If you check in, you get a free Thai iced tea which was delicious.  Because the place was packed on a Saturday night , the service was really slow. It was hard to get the attention of the waiters. They have indoor and outdoor seating.
"I have ordered from here a few times and couldn't find anything to complain about, all pretty standard. This will be the last time. The guy called and said ""come out side hurry up!"" What did I tip you 20% for? To order me around to come down and get my food? If he didn't think the tip was enough I was planning on also throwing him a few bucks cash in person as I usually do but obviously not after that.  ...Okay so off to a bad start but I had my food so I brushed it off, maybe he was having a bad day and if the food is good it's totally worth dealing with running up and down a few flights of stairs for. Sadly this wasn't the case when I open the bag it wreaks of fish, never a good sign. They also left out wasabi and ginger(which in all my years of ordering sushi has never happened how can you forget wasabi?!) and the side of spicy mayo I paid extra for. The only thing I will say is the tea I got was refreshing. Overall I am disappointed but I guess it is time to find a new place. :( and I really wanted to try the fried cheesecake and popcorn chicken."
I didn't love it or hate it. We tried the loaded fries, mac and cheese pancakes, chicken and waffles, a strawberry milkshake and the chicken sandwich. The fries, the milkshake and the chicken sandwich were the best of the list. The fries and sandwich had layers of flavor which I appreciate and the milkshake was a good balance of flavor and sugar (I don't love milkshakes usually because the sugar takes over). To me the chicken and waffles were too sweet and one noted. The mac and cheese pancakes was pretty tasteless - when ordered we envisioned mac and cheese made in the shape of a pancake but rather it was pancake batter with cooked macaroni and I believe shredded cheese mixed in it so it tasted like a flavorless pancake more than mac and cheese. TBH I am not sure if I would go back again.
Like others have said the sandwich is pretty good.  I liked the onion relish with mustard and the meat was decent.  If this sandwich was $6-8 I would go back.  $14 + tax = $15.24.  I was expecting a massive amazing sandwich, I got a tiny decent sandwich.  They have a scale on the counter for the meat, they must be weighing no more than 2-3oz, the sandwich is tiny. Bottino should make a pork sandwich just to make this place close down quicker.
BLAH is the word that I have to describe the food that I experienced yesterday. My friend and I weren't drinking because we were just getting over being sick so we didn't experience the cocktails (maybe that's what you stick with here!)  We shared the following:  -Fried Cheese Curds -Spinach and Artichoke Dip -Linguini with Clams  Cheese curds where basically mozzerella sticks in a ball formation and were nothing special. Spinach and artichoke dip was edible but so bland and it needed some kind of kick. The linguine and clams were almost inedible. It had the mustard creamy sauce which was pretty gross. The clams were tough and it was just overall disappointing. I was hoping for a white wine garlic sauce that linguine and clams usually are served in. I gave it a star for the decor because it is cute in there and the service was decent. I will not be back.
Tried to order country chicken. Ran out. Ordered country duck. Got a caterpillar instead. Actually. There was a caterpillar on my cilantro. It was still moving so we sent it back. Got the dish remade, without the caterpillar this time and it was fine. The portion was a little small, too much rice and not enough duck in proportion. The flavor was good though, although a little on the bland side, especially when eaten with rice. Definitely could have benefited from some more flavor. Boyfriend got the pork feet/hand noodle soup. The broth was very good, and the noodles were decent. The pork was decent as well but I've had better at home. Overall, the caterpillar really ruined my experience and they still charged us for the dish.
"Bottom line: More of a 3.5 star dining experience but I just can't round it up to 4 stars on what I had there. The Hidden Star cider choice and the bartender's service were the strong points here. Would I come back? Yeah, I could, it was OK. I think I would make some other eats choices however if here again. Would I particularly seek Cooper's out? Hmm, I'd say not necessarily. The Deets: Out to grab a bite last Saturday night, Chris M. and I came over to Cooper's Craft & Kitchen to give it a try. Pretty inviting, with large front bar and sitting space and then a semi-separate back bar and seating area. We were shown back to the back bar and we had our eats there. The atmosphere was pretty intensely loud and stayed that way throughout the visit. I opted for one of the cider choices there and it was a definite bright point of the visit. Getting the Slyboro Hidden Star cider was great, as the description says ""champagne and prosecco characteristics"" and it held true. If you like your ciders not so sweet, this one is a solid choice. We started with some meat and cheese selections which included such examples as Bresaola (beef loin) and Landaff (cave aged cow's milk that is dense but creamy). The meat/cheese plate was pretty good but not the best I've had in the area. It did the trick though, definitely. For my next eats, I went for three of the Little Mac Sliders (double patty beef cheeseburger sliders). The bread, especially the middle slice, was toasted way too much that it made it dusty dry type of crumbly when you bite into it. I ended up eating the sliders without the bread and that was not bad. I shared a bit of Chris M.'s French fries...not my type of fries in that they are not crunchy and a bit soggy. I have to say our bartender was good, kept on top of the situation and did attend to us well at the bar, no complaints service wise."
This tiny place was a huge let down for us.... with raving reviews, we thought we'd give it a try.  It wasn't worth trying at all.  I thought the food was meh at the most and it's so crammed and also no bathroom!!!  Not sure what everyone else is eating but it's not all that at all and the menu is so limited... sorry, definitely not a place we'd be coming back to or recommending.
All very one needs to know is it's very much disgusting there beyond imagine cockroach in food real?!!!!!!!!
A VERY bougie Korean fusion place.  I came with a group of 6 people on a Monday night. It was pretty empty (tbh, we probably didn't even need a reservation) but it quickly filled up as the night passed. We had a reservation so we got to spin the wheel that you see once you walk in for a free item. We got a jar of kimchi but the food already came with kimchi LOL.  It's a pretty dim place and there is a bar area in the back. 4 of my friends got the bibimbap which was pretty standard ($18-$19). There was nothing special about it. My other friend and I got the spicy seafood rice cakes ($16?) and soy garlic wings (13) to share. The portion was way smaller than we expected and 3/4 of our dish was cheese with empty clams but it was still good. The soy garlic wings were 6 pieces for $13... pretty expensive and it was pretty dry. Authentic korean places in flushing has way better wings for way cheaper. Is the price worth the food? Absolutely not. I can just go to Ktown or flushing and get the same items for cheaper but I would still come back if i'm feeling a little fancy for korean food.  The waiters were friendly and super welcoming. One of our waiters went the extra mile to run up the stairs to take a group photo for us!!  There was a 20% mandatory tip since we were a party of 6.
Lovely atmosphere and nice food :)  Obviously too crowded for Friday night tho. But I love this place for girls night out !
Went there for saturday brunch.  They have extensive menu as lunch & brunch.  We order Gugamole as appetizer  One crispy enchilada & de mole enchilada Both are very delicious! Highly recommend! I live in this area and surprise by the tastes! Price is not expensive ! Price range is between12-16$  Also Gugamole is good too.
Food was okay.. Had an average burger. The waiter was a bit of a tit (or barman? Guy with broken hand) he was just rude from the start. The Bloody Mary was quite disgusting and tasted like it had pickle juice in it & it hadn't been sieved so I struggled to drink it with tiny straws, maybe I'm just not used to bloody marys NY style. My partner loved his salmon club sandwich.
One of my favorite places in NYC to dine. However,the mushroom egg pizza on a scale of 1 to 10, was a 1 last night. Soggy crust, watery mushrooms made it impossible to eat. It was like having a pizza soup.  You might just need a new pizza oven.
Yums in my tums! Came yesterday with my friend, we waited around 5mins to be seated. The atmosphere was very nice with the lanterns. Right away, we were given water and menu.  We got the kimchi fries, shrimp pad Thai and pad kee mow. I would say the kimchi fries was awesome. The fries were perfectly crispy and the pad Thai was delicious. However, the lime didn't seem to really squeeze that well and I asked server 3 times for check and both they said okay, but never gave.
A nice place on Wall Street. Really like the use of books as decor and the wide plank floor. Good service, food, decor.
First, I like the design and decors of the restaurant, 5 star for that. They did a very good job. The hanging plants and the big dining table is a gorgeous statement in the restaurant. They can definitely accommodate a big group in that area. The service is fast and the staff are quite attentive.  However, I am not impressed with the food, at least the ones I ordered. They have a wide menu selection and other dishes may taste much better. I had shrimp pad Thai and its quite sweet for me, I think it had a little more brown sugar and less spices. Red curry is not too flavorful something is quite missing. Lemongrass maybe or more cilantro or kaffir lime, ginger? I'm not sure but it just doesn't taste flavorful and savory. I had better ones. Also i had wine and it was so scarce. Not even half full for $14 per glass. It's quite on the high price as well but I understand it's an UES restaurant and rent is high but I don't mind spending a lot for great food.
Really strange and weird, nautically themed and blasting old country music. Awesome. Good food and drink selection too.
As a Japanese, this ramen is not very good.   Considering the location, pricing was not bad. Neither was service. It's just not authentic and soup tasted like it includes artificial like msg
The manager is acting in an irritating way. Right after asking me to move my chair forward to make space, this guy DASHED INTO my seat back. Then a few minutes later, this guy KICKED my chair leg when passing by. You can tell that this was not coincidence. It was warning followed by force. This was more than rude, this was physical provocation. Destroyed our party. I would have given a 0-star if I could.
The food is decent but a bit pricey. However, the service is shockingly bad. I was here recently for a birthday dinner with a group of 8 plus a baby. At one point, the server spilled a beer on me that drenched my entire back and even splashed a little on the baby. I know mistakes happen so I didn't get overly upset, but what shocked me was that the manager never came over to make sure we were ok or see if we were ok and still able to have a good time. There are plenty of better choices for Cuban food in Hoboken, I wouldn't come back here.
"So I heard the hype about this place for some years now so I decided to check it out with my sisters. My best thing about the restaurant, is the art. The second, was the food names on the menu. One of them was Barack Obama so you can tell that they keep it updated. But after that, I can't say I really like anything else in there. I ordered chicken and waffles and a side of Mac and cheese.. I know, that's a weird combo but I heard the Mac and cheese is so good so I was like I have to try it.  The waiter didn't even ask us if we wanted anything to drink so we stuck with the water they gave us in the beginning. My chicken and waffles came and it just tasted normal. I guess I expected it to be out of this world like other places I've been too but I didn't enjoy it at all. After I was done eating I'm thinking, ""maybe the waiter was just bringing my Mac and cheese out after I was done"" he did not come back to ask if we was okay so I can bring up the Mac and cheese. Instead... When he came to ask are we ready for the receipt , I told him he can take the Mac and cheese off. He said he never order any Mac and cheese and then went off to go get the receipt. My sisters started laughing but I was pretty disappointed because that was the one thing I was looking forward too.  Maybe I just had a bad waiter so it was a bad experience. Not sure if I'll try here again :/"
Three of us had dinner there on October 5. Our waitress seemed nervous serving drinks and food. Two of us had the lamb entree. Neither of us could finish it because it was over salted--the meat on top and the beans on the bottom. The third of us had almost finished eating before the waitress or anyone else came over to check on the table. The new restaurant is very nice. The menu seems great. I'm not sure I'll give it another try. A similar thing happened to me on my very first visit to the original USQ many years ago. The response of the staff that night and when I returned was excellent. I miss that staff.
"Seriously no idea how this place got 4 stars.  Miso soup was meh.  Green tea came with American tea cups and Tazo tea bags (wha? This is a Japanese place!). I had the ""special"" roll which was the Sushi Sandwich.   No kidding I couldn't bite through my eel in that roll.  It was like rubber!  My date made a joke that they gave me the display eel. And the prices are no joke!  Super disappointing meal.   Neither of us finished our entrees. The music is weird too... So Four Seasons, Christmas music, Nirvana Unplugged, Styx and Captain & Tenille? This place is bizarre.  Never coming back!"
Mominette seems to be the place for brunch in Bushwick. They have a small inside, and a larger garden area that is shaded in the back. We called prior for reservations bc our party was very large. When we arrived on time, it seemed they weren't ready for us. We had to push small tables together to make adequate seating. It was somewhat inconvenient. The staff here is not that friendly.  We looked at the menu and I decided on the pancake and others at my table ordered French toast, chicken and waffles and eggs Benedict.  The pancake was fluffy and flavorful. It came with a flavored butter/cream cheese on top and fruit. I went to use one of the maple syrup containers and it was dirty. I had to ask for another one.  The French toast was fluffy and cooked perfectly. Again, served with fruit. The eggs Benedict. Was served with bacon and the sauce was just okay. The potatoes needed some seasoning. The chicken and waffles dish was a medium portion. They were tenders instead of on the bone and it already came with a gravy. The waffle was crunchy and delicious. Mominette is decent for brunch. I feel they lack in cleanliness and the staff could be friendlier. If you are coming here, the pancake is the way to go.  Parking wasn't difficult(293)
Catfish & cheese grits was amazing! The staff were amazing & wonderful as well. Would definitely go back again soon.
"Highly disappointed here. Came here with a party and waited a half hour to be sat even with a reservation. When we finally ordered,  the food portion came to half of what Union previously provided for brunch. Waiter's response: ""now it's different"". SMH this is not how you get return customers. Chicken was also half raw in the middle and I was told ""it's dark meat so it's supposed to be like that."" What kind of establishment is this? You won't see me again."
One of the worst Chinese place I've been to in NYC The environment feels unsanitary and give a string raw pork smell The casserole we ordered is bitter and my friend find a small bug in the soup. When we talked to the waitress, she explained confidently that this must get in after cook or it would be dissolved into the soup. Is this supposed to make us feel better ?! It still didn't change the fact that a bug get into my food in your restaurant!! They change the soup into one other pure vege dish and charged us the same!  worst part is, even the vege doesn't taste good The panned bon has only skin, the filling is tiny as shown in the picture Definitely not recommending for anyone in their right mind to dine here
It's NYC. I get it. Hotel rooftop with a view, drinks and food are going to be expensive. Fine, the price isn't the problem - it's the horrible quality of the drinks and food that's the problem. We had reservations and ordered appetizers, drinks and a main course. Between two people and 8 items, we didn't like a single thing - that's quite impressive.  I guess when you have a view you can charge ridiculous prices while serving up trash and get away with it. Take my advice, go here for the view if you want one but order nothing but bottled beer.
It was such a good place, but it has become a disgusting one with such a terrible service and food. Not better then some fast food Chinese 2$/dish place. Very noisy. Tables are dirty. Server was sitting next to us during ordering  a dinner. That's something new!!!!!!
I really try to support local businesses, and am always excited to try a new restaurant in the neighborhood. Plus,  I LOVE Mexican food!  Sadly, this restaurant is a hot mess. First, don't get your hearts set on drinks. They still don't have a liquor license, so no tasty margaritas. They do offer several types of sangria, but if you're looking for something enjoyable stick to tap water or the bottled beer or Jarritos. The paltry glass of watery fruit water can't really be called sangria. After 4 sips, it just wasn't worth drinking.  We split an order of flautas and fundito thinking those were pretty easy to get right.  I hate being wrong.  There wasn't anything wrong with the flautas, but there wasn't anything exciting about them either. Mostly cheese inside, with the ends dipped in beef. Meh at best.  The fundito was... a mistake. When I think of a bowl of delicious melted cheese mixed with spicy chorizo, the image isn't what was served. The cheese needed to be cut with a knife. Not kidding. The chorizo was scarce, overcooked crumbles. The entire dish was greasy and tasteless. Served with a side of sad mini corn tortillas that were just an unfortunate waste of corn. Overall this dish was just bad.  $40 for two sangria, one Dos Equis, one app of flautas and one of fundito. The only enjoyable parts of the meal were the chips on the table and the beer. Environment is pleasant, and staff were friendly, but should pay more attention if their patrons ask for their check with half finished meals and full drinks on the table - that's usually a sign that something was wrong.  Brooklyn Heights is in desperate need of a Mexican restaurant, even mores now that Gallitos has moved in.
Nice little hipster bar. Queit late lunchtime on a saturday. Was not quite the place I was looking for but enjoyed it enough to stay much longer then had planned. Very clean. Pleasent servers. Nice beer selection on draught and bottled. I liked having acces to fresh ice cold water in front of the bar. Sandwiches look delicous. Must go back and eat.
All five of my stars go to this Michelin starred place near Washington Square! The pastas were amazing and the service was impeccable. I would come back here in a heartbeat and the prices were cheap for the quality of food here! Plus it's food inspired from Mario Batali so you know it's been curated by a competent chef!
We came here for dinner on a Saturday night and the restaurant was packed! The wait was ridiculous but somehow the food God's were in our favor and the 5 other parties of 2 weren't there! I ordered the small tandoor chicken and my friend had the lamb tagine and both were delicious! Mine was easily an 8/10 and my friends lamb was falling off the bone (nom)  I'm a sucker for atmosphere and I really love the interior! Will absolutely be back!
I had the pleasure of going this nice restaurant with my family & uncle & aunt visiting the US for the very first time this past weekend. We loved the atmosphere & how quickly accommodating they were to sit all 6 of us. We all loved our authentic Italian dishes & the great selections of wine that go perfectly together. Service was fantastic and we felt like part of the family. My family & I will definitely be returning soon.
Meh... there's better and it gave me a tummy ache. Not food poisoning but something did not settle well. It's not clean and is tiny but the food is cheap and tasted yummy. Don't think I'd go back.
First time here yesterday. You'll find pasta, burgers and salad on the menu, but also steak and sea food. I liked the menu and ordered the spaghetti funghi. It was nice, although the sauce could've been a bit thicker and more spiced for my taste. Unfortunately I was left still hungry because the $19 portion wasn't really that big. And I'm usually the one who takes leftovers with them.
This place is awesome. Just order the dumplings! I got the tiny steamed pork buns. I also ordered the pan fried pork dumplings. I will for sure come back to this spot when in the area! Make sure to try the fried tiny buns with pork!
Waiter was aloof, not sure if they were trying to portray a hipsterish vibe, but it was a bit offsetting and awkward? We were a party of five he had us at a table of four plus an add on chair on the side. When asked if we could be moved to a larger table, he immediately told us no and that this was the largest table. (Two tables down there was a empty table for six. Restaurant was empty except for the outdoorsy/back area) After we settled down, he said actually let's move. Hm knocked off a star for that. We had a total of 11 tapas many of which had similar base sauce/relatively salty, and a play on heat vs fruit for the summer season. The bill ran up to be about $240 including tip.  Strawberry cinnamon glazed Berkshire Baby back ribs were alright. They tasted like they were first boiled/pressure cooked over before quickly fried. Crisp on the outside and moist on inside. Although not a powerful flavor that I expect from baby back ribs. The sauce was strawberry cinnamon, which sounds better than what it actually tasted. There were a few strawberries strewn on top. We ordered two of these per recommendation of waiter and I think that was a mistake; one would've been enough since there are better dishes on the menu. Baked muenster cheese, smoked chorizo, golden apples, crostini. This dish was salty with the cheese and chorizo. The chorizo reminded me of bacon bits. IMO this dish wasn't worth it  Seared dayboat  scallops, snap and English pea risotto, caper tomato brown butter had a nice seat and the risotto was a creamy balance to the saltiness of the scallops. This was a good dish. Seared foie gras, Yukon potatoes, bacon, Sunnyside, maple, hot sauce. This was a rich dish and the maple was a good touch. Potatoes really soaked up.the flavor well.  We had some filler dishes that I can't recall.  Below are the really memorable dishes: Hampshire Pork Belly had nice kick with the banana peppers and subtle sweetness with the summer peach. Good combo. Duck with a butternut squash sauce with blueberry glaze, blue cheese on the side. This was souse vide for sure -- the color was even throughout and tender moist. Great sear and interesting sauce. Ended with the best dish of the night.
Coppelia is a throw back diner with a Latin infused menu of popular restaurant offerings ... I enjoy the healthy options on the menu such as their Havana (Kale) Salad (add shrimp, chicken, etc.) and my fave drink from the bar is the Gran Paloma, which is all that. Since they're open 24hrs its even more enjoyable for breakfast or an early lunch when its not a madhouse like during dinner hours!
Food was delicious. Service was quick. Great for a quick bite and walking distance from the Brooklyn bridge.
Authentic and good food but we were not prepared for how spicy it was!! I recommend getting radishes so your mouth doesn't light on fire.
Not sure what the hype is all about. The tonkatsu itself is quite flavorless, thick, and too oily to be a noodle on its own. The spicy version is quite good, with just enough additional salt to make the soup flavorful. Noodles themselves are nice and chewy, toppings are well made. I just don't think its worth an hour wait outside to get this ramen, especially if you didn't know that the spicy ramen is the only good thing on the menu.
I have to be contrarian and say that the food here is not really worth the price, and I suspect a lot of the fanfare is around its referral-only system where you have to know someone who's been here in order to make a reservation. My favorite thing about this place is the decor: it's a small intimate restaurant that seats probably no more than 15, with low, mid-century modern armchairs serving as your dining seats. The low height makes you feel like you're dining at a traditional Japanese restaurant with your shins tucked under your thighs, but more comfortably. There's also a minimalist ink painting of the world map with Japan in the center that I enjoyed. However, as stylish as the decor is, the reclining backs don't really make it easy to engage with your dining partners without sitting with your back off the chair. Then the food. The beef sashimi was so underwhelming I just can't even. I just feel like there was not a great deal of finesse used to slice the meat, nor was the meat high quality, I felt like I was eating small rubbery pieces of flesh that didn't have much flavor. The uni croquette was good, but I'm still not positive that dolloping uni on a fried breaded ball is the most user-friendly experience of eating the two together. I liked the mushroomy creaminess of the croquette, and I like uni independently, but it was technically challenging to get the flavors of both cleanly. My final dish was the soba noodles with foie gras. Now, I personally feel like it's very hard to screw up soba noodles. I also feel like foie gras generally elevates a dish just because it's a luxe item. For this reason, I feel like this dish was not a standout. On top of all this, the food took a really long time to come out. I don't know what emergencies they were having in the kitchen; all I know was that my little morsels of food was taking way too long to come and I was not happy.
Nice interior design..food is good. But food portion is way too small. Entree is like appetizer size. Even too little for a small size Asian girl.
Great food but horrible service. Especially the Asian server. If you don't mind the terrible customer service then it's decent since it's the only Mediterranean joint in the area.
10/10 would recommend!! Best meal I've had in a very long time. Didn't catch his name, but our waiter was amazing - I felt like he was a friend and we were dining at his house. It's also very inexpensive for what it is. For two, we shared 3 beers, 6 oysters, crab cakes, clam fettuccini, scallop risotto - and the bill was under $100. I'll be back a thousand times!
"We had an awful experience at lunch. I ordered a pa Kee Mao, which it was rarely cooked with no taste. I told a male water that I didn't like it and his response was ""that's how we Cock"". Later on I told him why I didn't like the food, but the answer was still ""that's how we cook"" - no sorry from him - I was very disappointed because I used to come here quite often, and they used to have good service and food, but not anymore.   And of course he deserved no tips, and that made him chase after us asking ""why tip so little? I want to make sure everything was fine"" - I don't understand - why would you hire this kind of ignorant people in your restaurant?"
"TL;DR: Food was great, service was terrible - have had better at Tasty Hand Pulled Noodles, honestly. The atmosphere was also pretty conservative - not a place for young people. I went with my SO for his birthday. My first thought upon walking in was how dark it was; the whole place looked like it was lit by one single candle. The second, as we sat down, was the noise level; throughout dinner, I had to lean halfway across the table to hear what my SO was saying.  Scarpetta's clientele on this particular Saturday night was mostly parties of older, white banker types who can afford to spend a ton on multiple rounds of food and wine. Our waiter was fawning over them like they were long lost cousins. Scarpetta seems to cater to an older audience, rather than a young, ""hip"" diner. This gets me to my second point: our service was so, so bad. We sat between two larger parties, and the different levels of service we were getting was very apparent. Our waiter spent tons of time chatting with both other tables, offering them suggestions, whereas I could probably count the number of sentences we spoke to our waiter on one hand. I definitely felt very ignored, and we'd sit with empty plates at our table for long stretches of time before anyone came by again. I know we weren't spending as much money, but we did drop $200 on a meal, which is, in the grand scheme of things, a lot of money. It's hard to not feel bad when there's a clear contrast right next to you. Onto the food. The bread basket was nice, but they didn't have olives. My SO, who's lived in Italy, was peeved; ""what self respecting Italian restaurant doesn't have olives?!"" he grumbled. I had the polenta to start and a vegetarian ravioli special as my main; my SO got the chestnut soup and the tagliatelle, and we split the espresso budino and he had a grappa to finish. Polenta amazing as reported, but so rich and creamy that I couldn't finish. Chestnut soup fine - not remarkable - tagliatelle much lighter than my mushroom ravioli and pasta noodles so perfectly cooked. All in all, 5/5 for the food, but I hate feeling like a second class citizen while dining so I wouldn't recommend unless you're coming to drop major $."
Went here for lunch with my friend on a Monday. There are tastings of cheese, meats and olive oil in the front of the store and the tapas counter as you walk further in. The dining room, which I found to have ample space, is to the left of the tapas counter. The tosta pulpo was incredible and inexpensive. It's a rare treat to be able to eat octopus on a week day for lunch. I wasn't as big a fan of the tortilla despana which tasted similar to a quiche. The food came pretty quickly and I liked the seating area which was clean and classy. I would come here all the time if I worked nearby!
Came here with a group of 5 on a Friday night for dinner (we had a reservation and were seated immediately). The service was very good and the food generally on point.  They also have complimentary still and sparkling water, which I always like when restaurants have their own filtration system. Although not really the restaurants fault, the department of health showed up unannounced around 8:30 (we sat down at 8 and had already ordered) and that meant the kitchen had to shut down while they were doing their health inspection (so we were there much longer than expected).  This was incredibly inconvenient and really put a damper on our experience generally, though the restaurant did comp one of our bottles of wine (though no one actually checked the bill to confirm this happened) and gave us extra order of pickles. We shared a bunch of items: Oysters - delicious, I prefer the littler oysters Fluke - this was amazing and had great flavors, the coldness from the ice offered nice contrast Pork Buns- in my opinion the best of all their locations as there wasn't too much fat Side pickles - not really pickles and rather pickles veggies, but still good Snow peas and mushrooms with anchovy and cheese - this was so tasty, the crunch from the greens, with the cheese was perfect  Asian pears - loved this Duck Saam - this is a must order, it is so perfectly cooked and the skin incredibly crispy. The wrap with all the sauces are fantastic Overall it's probably closer to 4.5 stars than 4 and I'll definitely be back with a group so we can get the duck again!
Based on the number of reviews and being 4 plus stars, my family decided to give it a try.  1. The service was poor. We ordered our food and waited 1 hr to get it. 3 steaks and plate of ribs. During that time our waitress was avoiding us. She did not check or update us.  2. Every plate came out warm to cool not close to being hot. My ribeye steak was ordered medium came out completely well done.  To say the least, we left disappointed.
"China Blue's portions are stingier than my grandma! At least her food is delicious and free! Examples below: Pork Dumplings in Chili Oil $9: essentially a few giant piece of dough with a microscopic scoop of meat each, which judging by appearance, a two year old child could have assembled Pan Fried Pork Buns $8: I took ONE bite into the bun that sliced it in half and did not even get to the meat filling - did I get punk'd?! Rice Cakes with Salted Duck Eggs and Shrimp $16: well this dish will fill you up because they should change the name to Only Rice Cakes Drenched in Salted Duck Egg Yolks (Oh and You May Find A Shrimp or Two Left Behind From the Food Served in this Plate Previously!) Sautéed Mixed Mushrooms $17: grease and oil medley Steamed Whole Bass with Ginger $24: guess they can't skimp you here when it's literally supposed to be the whole fish - only dish that's worth it I don't understand the good reviews. I mean, I kind of do. China Blue embodies a typical ""high-end"" Chinese restaurant well in its decor and $price$. However, it does not reflect well on Chinese food in terms of serving or taste. I'm exhausted from recalling this meal that I won't even comment much on the lack of service. Just skip it, seriously."
So, I have been here twice and on both occasions they were mediocre at best. The place is very nautical and you order at the cashier but they bring the food to your table. The outside garden seemed nice but oddly dark, I guess they promote mosquitoes.  The food: Lobster rolls- New England lobster roll and Connecticut were both kinda boring and too simple, but the New England was slightly better. What I expect from a proper lobster roll is a great buttered hotdog roll and unctuous chunks of lobster meat and this wasn't the case.  Lobster Mac- the shells were nice and the sauce was OK, not too overbearing but if i wanted over cooked lobster, I woulda made it myself. Shrimp fritter and Calamari- both your standard diner fare, not amazing not bad enough to slap the chef.  My gold standard is still the Pearl Oyster bar
Went here for my birthday and although I had made a reservation far ahead of time, when we went we still had to wait almost an hour for my table which is ABSURD. I was so angry because I had planned stuff for afterwards but it all got delayed.  In terms of food, it's all extremely mediocre. We ordered quite a lot of dishes because we had 8 people but in all honesty I think this place is a glorified P.F. Chang's.   Not worth it all all and the good wasn't good enough to make up for the terrible experience.  The decor inside is nice however as it is pretty sleek, modern, and trendy looking. Not worth it though.
I usually get delivery pad see ew from here, and it's just not as flavorful as some as the other Thai places in the area. It does arrive early, however, which is much appreciated.
My friend recommended this place for dinner and said it was one of her favorites. Meeting up with her was confusing. Both of us didn't know there were 2 locations, one for sit down and the other for take out. We were seated right away which was nice. However this place is packed, I repeat, PACKED! They were originally going to seat us in between 2 large parties and we had no way of getting in without asking everyone to move. That just didn't make sense for anyone. Then they sat us another table. We got the Mexican Corn (which was the highlight of my experience) and Al Pastor tacos. The corn was phenomenal and I wish I had that instead of the tacos. The pork tasted weird. I thought it was just me but my friend agreed and said the same thing. The mango lemonade my friend had was good! One thing to note, this place is really loud, like really loud and it's not because of the customers. It's because of the staff. I found it a bit difficult to catch up with my friend and weird things were distracting us like flying menus and loud noises from one of the staff. It was a bit unsettling and was kind of looking forward to getting the bill. I personally would only come back for the corn and lemonade. Had high hopes but they weren't met.
I don't know why this is classified as $$ when it cost more than all the $$$ places I go to. Prices look low on the menu but it's small plates so you have to order a lot.  And the food was good but not amazing
For the first time coming here, the overall experience was great. The venue itself is nice, the staff is friendly, & the food (the most important part of a restaurant) was delicious! Also, when you're w/ an Italian & they too approve of the Italian food you both eat- Well... That's a pretty good thing- Lol.
I love lobster, boiled, stir fried, or in a salad.  I was so unsatisfied with the lobster rolls here.  The only thing I actually enjoyed was the fried pickles.   I tried the maine and the connecticut, it felt like I had a mouth full of claw.  Who wants that?  I want some body! The lemonade and ginger beer were disappointing, too sour and tasted like wet rag water.  The group also did not enjoy their cocktails, had to send them back. Coming back? Eeks me think not.
I came here with a few friends for dinner and it was so much fun! The cocktails were perfectly mixed, the applewood bread was to die for, and the pasta was handmade in house. The burrata is also a must try! We splurged on the fried banana dessert and it was amazing. I love the open plan kitchen concept and it was fun to watch the chefs prepare dishes on the line. We sat upstairs on the mezzanine and the vibe was v. relaxed and the decor was rustic with beautiful lighting. Perfect for a date night and great for group dinners too! Service was also v attentive. Cant recommend this place enough!
Went with a friend who helped write this review. We agreed it's a good spot to catch up with a close friend or a good date spot. Cheese ball was delicious. Loved the combo of the rich cheese with the sweetness of the caramelized onions and the acid from the wine they were reduced in. Flatbread was good but didn't stand out. Trout was awesome - perfectly cooked, melted in your mouth. Sauce was bright and acidic. Wine flight was a great deal, pretty good wines for the price
Okay, I don't get the appeal here. Maybe as a hangover food on the run from the takeaway place, but as a sit down? Never again.  The food was not very good. A plus was the bread but the filling all just melded together..in a mushy bland way, not a nice balance of flavors. The appetizer we had was good, plantains with cheese on them. That was actually really flavorful thanks to their famous sauce and the cilantro.  The atmosphere sucks especially if it's cold out. Cramped and uncomfortable with waitstaff and fellow diners falling over you. I get that it's nyc and this is how it is a lot of the time, but this is the first time I've been bothered by it. Not going back, no thanks.
My coworker who grew up around here swears by this place. After listen to him glow about it for a solid 6 months, we finally went. I love meat (in moderation) and BBQ, so it was definitely on. I decided to have the pastrami bacon, brisket, corn bread, and queso mac and cheese. The brisket was definitely above average, though not the absolute best I've ever had. The pastrami bacon was really good and that first bite was awesome. Corn bread above average and the queso mac and cheese was a nice change from a normal mac and cheese. The interior reminded me a lot of Green Street Smoked Meats in Chicago which is a good thing. Good ambiance. All in all, I haven't had a ton of BBQ in NYC but this is so far the best and a pretty good standard. I would recommend for any lover of BBQ. Side note: You and your clothes WILL smell heavily of smoke/meat after eating here
A friend and I arrived for Happy Hour on a Wednesday night at 5:15 and Barn Joo was already pretty packed. All the high-top tables by the front entrance and next to the bar are reserved for Happy Hour only and they were all occupied. The waitress said it would be about a 20-minute wait for a table and they would text us when one came available. Luckily we got seats at the bar. The Happy Hour menu is great - $1 oysters, cocktail shrimp, Korean fried chicken wings, potstickers, and fries for food and a variety of drinks from beer, wine and cocktails to choose from. We ordered a dozen oysters and they came out quick - they must have a guy constantly shucking. They oysters were fine - probably Bluepoint from Long Island as is typical where most $1 HH oysters come from in NYC. They were shucked well (cleanly and no sand/grit pieces) and served with a peppery cocktail sauce, mignonette (I enjoyed both) and sriracha that come in cute glass dropper bottles. We also had 2 orders of the chicken wings - one in medium spicy and the other soy-garlic. Wow. I don't like chicken unless it's fried and these were absolutely delicious. They came out piping hot and fresh out of the fryer with a nice crispy skin and flavorful inside. The spice was just the right amount of medium and the soy-garlic was nice as well though I preferred the spicy. The truffle fries were good too. Thick cut and crispy - I didn't get too much garlic/truffle taste but I enjoyed them a lot with the sauces they were served with (some kind of ketchup/mayo combo?) Service was great - the bartenders though busy were attentive and quick and we did get a text from the hostess for a table in less than the 20 minutes stated. They moved us over to a nice table by the open window and the waitress was very very nice. Checked up on us frequently, alerted us to last call for HH and water refills were constant. You also get actual utensils, cloth napkins, wet wipes and a small pail for discarding your bones/garbage when you sit at a table. The space is beautiful. It's very big with an upstairs and a private room in the back. Nicely decorated with lots of wood, fake birch (?) trees along the wall, ropes as decoration, cool light fixtures and a very cool vibe. It's a fun atmosphere in a great location. I will definitely be back.
This review is not for the food since I haven't tried it yet. It's for trying to book a room at their establishment. I was planning on booking their room downstairs and was told a certain price. After a couple of weeks of contemplating I called back and was about to set up the date, etc when the manager informed me it was going to be a different price, that the menu that was offered to me at the beginning of August for September was no longer available. Price was going to be about $20-30 more per person! As a customer and someone who used to work in the restaurant business I think next time you guys should try to accommodate your customers better, and next time don't give a price and then weeks later claim it's not available. That's how you lose people. Was looking forward to booking your room and having dinner there as well, but that didn't happen and thankfully I found a better place.
The atmosphere was great...until I talked to the hosts and the hostess. They were pretty snobby. We were asking for a table and we got a pretty horrible service. Will not come back ever again.
I've been to river cafe many  times and I've always thought of it as a very nice place to get a diner. I've had 3 birthdays dinners there ,been many times there with my boyfriend. Today we have been rejected a service at this place because we came with the equipment . Me and my friends who are professional photographers came to river cafe to have a breakfast and talk to the clients. Only one of us was allowed to stay there . the other part of the team had to leave because the equipment is not allowed even on the terrace. Just because we obviously weren't able to leave an  expensive equipment outside or in the car we were literally thrown out of the restaurant like some trash in a very rude and unprofessional way. If you are not able to accommodate clients , at least be nice and apologize for that. They way we were treated is very offensive and I'll make sure to tell everyone to avoid this place at all costs since now. Very disappointing
Food was not great! Ordered the Barcelona blue salad which came with iceberg lettuce not romaine, the bacon was hard as a rock, the 5 shrimp definitely were not sautéed! My friend had the Arroz con Pollo that had no flavor at all!!  I will say that the Gambas al Ajillo and calamari from the tapas section was alright, but not amazing. Service was also slow as they only had one waitress working during happy hour!! This is not a spot I would be running to go back too!
"This place is awesome. Pretty much as good as it gets when it comes to chill, laid back environment and damn good seafood.  Reasonably priced, be prepared for a wait (esp if you come during HH which I've heard is a great deal).  My friend and I came here after HH on a weeknight and waited about 30 mins.  What we ordered:  Fettucine with clams - I can understand why this is considered the ""wife's"" house favorite.  Everything about this dish is perfect.  Portion size, flavor, pasta al dente, just loved it. Get this! Scallop special - definition of buttery.  Each bite was an explosion of flavor.  Get this! Roasted oysters - perfect start to the meal.  Could have eaten 10 of these.  Get this too!  Can't wait to go back again!"
"Simple, small-portioned, clean (almost bland) food, offered at much too high prices. The avocado open faced toast I had at the counter here was not good. Tartinery tried to ""fancy"" up the toast by squeezing lemon juice in the guac spread and by sprinkling quinoa bits on top, but I would have preferred it without either.  Since my friend and I dined at the bar area ""to stay"", we were obligated also to pay gratuity, thereby bringing the cost of my $2-cost ""meal"" (if you can call it a meal, as I was hungry again in less than two hours) to an outrageous $18 (which included a can of Coca Cola I ordered to accompany the toast).  Our server was nice enough, and happily snapped photos of my friend and myself together (we hadn't seen each other in a year), but next time we'll just take selfies at Shake Shack."
This place has some great food.  We had to wait a few minutes to be seated, but it was well worth it. Once seated we were helped by a young lady named Latesha. She was really great and she some how manage to take care of her tables.  The manager was nice as well. Nice place to visit if visiting or go often if you live there. I will be returning soon!
Felt rushed because they were about to close for the dinner break I guess .. the prices are a bit high for simple things like dumplings .
Looking for a great place with great food with in walking distance of the One World Trade Center. I got the Hanger Steak and it is very tasty. Everyone else in our party really liked it. Reasonable prices also. Highly recommend.
Delicious fish tacos!! I work right near here and tried one out after my coworkers had been raving about them. The fish was hot in temperature and very crispy. Delicious hot sauce. One was just enough for me. Only $3.75 or so, too!
"Dinner at Ugly Kitchen was mediocre. Two friends and I came and were squished into a tiny table even though we had a reservation. The table was so tiny that we could hardly fit two entrees on it at the same time. The drinks were the best part of the meal - we made it in time for happy hour and their spicy mango drink was yummy. But really, the food was so ""meh."" The dumplings tasted like pizza. The brie/apple bruschetta was more of a dessert than an appetizer. The chicken adobo was extremely salty and the pork belly entree was 3/4ths fat (I know that pork belly has a lot of fat on it but this dish hardly had any meat). I was definitely disappointed.  Would come back for drinks but not for food."
I am a big fan of comfy food. I caught an outside table. The only table. Although the waiter had an attitude. I did not mind. I had just left the book store.  I ordered an adventurous IPA/Dark beer. Its taste was a lingering spicy chocolately taste bud treat. Paired with a mushroom smothered Buttermilk Fried Chicken with Vermont Cheesy grits.    Abso-smurfly delicious. I did not want to plate to end. Until the waiter came back.  In earshot, he tells a co-worker if 'that guy' leaves me a dollar tip, I will hand it right back. I left a dollar on the plate. The payment and rest of his tip under the plate. I was hoping that he would run down the street after me. That would have been epic.
First let me say I never write reviews. I have had lunch here as it's near my office. Dinner was an entirely different experience. It was my birthday dinner. After being seated we waited 30 minutes before we were asked what we would like to drink. I told my family we have to get the meatballs as they are the best. They served our salad and then brought out our dinner. They forgot our meatball appetizer.  As we were halfway through dinner they bring the meatballs which we refused. Of course they apologized and gave us a dessert sampler on the house but our waiter never asked us if we wanted coffee which we did. The check arrived with the dessert so I said I guess we are not having coffee.  He was very polite to the table next to us and offered then coffee. Finally they forgot to remove the meatballs from my check, good thing I checked. Waiter had too many tables to service by himself.  Terrible Birthday dinner.
Amelie has been on my list of wine bars to check out for a while. While they seem to be known for their happy hour wine flights, I prefer drinking glasses of wine (more to appreciate) so what stood out to me was their pretty extensive wine list, especially by the glass. Some of the wines were pretty mediocre, but others were quite good: I recommend the Madiran (really excited to see this on the list!), the Graves, and the Cotes du Rhone. The Chinon was pretty good as well. The staff was friendly and, while there are wine bars in the city with higher quality lists, the wine was decent, especially for the prices they were serving it at. The list is diverse enough for almost everyone to find something they like. I loved the atmosphere and the decor of Amelie too, especially the lights!
I came here for a quick pickup during lunch break. I had never been here before but I decided to try it out via Yelp reviews. Unfortunately I was incredibly disappointed in the quality of the food. I ordered a simple Broccoli and Garlic Sauce with White Rice and asked for some chili sauce on the side. It tasted incredibly bland; the chili sauce tasted like rotten garbage. I had the runs for a few days afterwards. Nice staff (rarity in Chinatown) but never again.
What an unpleasant place. Just a heads up, this review is mostly for the waiter we had so the whole dinner experience was bad. Oh and it didn't help that the food wasn't good either.  1. Service was terrible- The host/ waiter didn't greet us. Had a sour demeanor. Barely checked on us. And the times he checked on us were the times he wanted to clear our plates out or check whether we paid the check. Kept walking back and forth to check but didn't offer us water or anything. Ok. Thanks. I just felt annoyed and irritated the whole time because the waiter was just not nice-  and that's not what you should get from a waiter who wants good tips. You get tipped how you serve. And the service was bad.  2. Food was sub par. The carbonara pork belly... Dryest pork belly ever. I had to only skim the fat cause the pork was hard. How do you make pork belly hard and dry-  I will not know. The sauce was dry and sticky.  Maybe I went during a bad time. Maybe it's good during happy hour but not after 9pm. But all I know is I will not be back. For how much they're charging.. With how sub par the food and service is, not worth it.
"I have to say, I wasn't wowed with this place. Walked quite a bit with a friend visiting in town to visit and the place wasn't too busy, but for the most part full. We were told we could wait or be seated at the bar, so we decided to sit at the bar area so we would be served quicker. However, we ended up waiting over 30 minutes, while attempting to flag down staff or waiters. Just as we were turning around to get up an leave, the new host asks us what we were doing and said we hadn't been served because ""we were facing the wrong direction"" even though we had just turned around..yeah, okay. After that the service was decent and the food was the same. I ordered a burger with vermont cheese, and it was good, but not worth the money you spend."
Amazing food !! Super fast service and really nice staff. Had a great dinner there with my group. Their spaghetti was so good I literally ordered another plate of it. I also had steak which was cooked perfectly !
"Atmosphere:  I like it! When you walk in there's a cute little tank of lobsters. The layout is not chaotic and the hostess was friendly. I like that pretty much every table has a booth attached and chairs on the other side. Service:  Below average. Our waitress wasn't too friendly..didn't introduce herself and never smiled. Her first words were ""hey are you guys ready?""..............She came to take our order, but didn't come back until we waved her over an hour later, to bring the bill. Both times food was delivered to our table, it was brought by a different woman who looked like she may have been the manager.  Cleanliness: the menu/placemats were dirty and covered with oil spots and grease. Kind of gross that they don't change those in between diners. Hubby said the bathroom was pretty clean. Food: I loved the original lobster roll. It was very filling and the garlic butter drizzled on top was heavenly. Without the butter, the roll was still good, but the butter really kicks it up a notch. The original 10oz burger was also good, but keep in mind that it's huge and hard to finish for one person. Fries were below average, like the frozen kind you can get from any supermarket. Salad was also below average - warm and wilted which was strange..not sure if it was pre-made and had been sitting out. Price: for two people, we spent about $60. Prices are average for this neighborhood, and we enjoyed the main portion of our food. Verdict: overall an average experience, nothing too exciting. I plan on checking out more restaurants in this area to see how they compare."
Congratulations Brooklynites, you're looking at the next Xi'an famous foods. This place has got the it factor to make it big and I am surprised how it hasn't. When you browse up the address and make it to the store, you might have some second thoughts before going in considering how it is on the shabbiest stretch of Downtown Brooklyn next to a shoddy nail salon and some unknown prepaid phone reseller. But the fun really begins when you go in. They follow a counter ordering with square checkout model quite similar to Xi'an famous foods. You know the drill, just place your order (you can even do it online) and grab a seat until your number is called. They were pretty efficient and I got my freshly made tangbao (soup dumplings) and cold noodle in a matter of minutes. And boy did I love the food. The tangbao was fantastic, the dough skin was just the right thickness, the soup still boiling hot (make sure you don't burn your lips though) and the cold noodle made a perfect complement even on a day when temperature outside leans on the low side. They give you both soy sauce and vinegar and a host of Chinese chili sauces to pick from, which is hard to fulfill at some sit-down Chinese places, let alone a fast-casual store like this. But they did it. The vibe of the store bodes well with Brooklyn, and you will be surprised how colonial Shanghai artworks blend with Brooklyn brick walls, all of which making the space even more exquisite and pleasant to visit. Come in and you won't make a mistake.
I was looking for the perfect Italian and the meatballs we're amazing. The sauce was unbelievable! I am so happy that I went last night. 5 stars!!!
Excellent lobster roll, and delicious lemonade. The staff was very friendly, and the service was great. Highly recommended.
I went here with husband pretty excited to have another Asian spot in the neighborhood. I am Asian myself and have been to Taiwan (ate a shit ton in Taipei). Decor and vibes were great but food was disappointing:( small portions, over priced. Napkins pretty fancy though so maybe they should cut on that.  Had the fried eggplant paired with cashews and some kind of cheese like creme fraiche, $9. I get the effort to make interesting combinations but it wasn't working. Husband had noodles, v little broth and one tiny shrimp on top .noodles were overcooked. $17!
Ridiculously good food at great prices.  The brisket ssam pulled apart with chopsticks, the tea egg was a delight and the coke with real sugar pulled it all together. Friendly and knowledgable staff recommended the pork belly steamed buns to start and right from there I knew thisnwould be a good experience. Highly recommended.
"I usually love this place but their take out leaves MUCH to be desired. The first take out order they did not include the desert I ordered. When I returned and explained what happened it was explained to me that they don't have deserts to go. But they charged me tho. So I ordered AGAIN - and this time I ordered 2  1.5lb lobsters to go...and they gave me ONE butter for each lobster. WTH? How cheap can you guys get?  Last order I got 2 butters for EACH. Boy that Stella he said was ""on him"" was REALLY the money they overcharged me on the last order SURE was generous. And this was the order the MANAGER submitted as a means to make up for the last experience. What a mess. I'm never going back to this location.  Stick to the original on 19th for a good experience."
We came on a weekday lunch, the restaurant had a team filming a project over the bar counter but everything was under control just a bit crowded, waited in line about 15 min. The three start is mainly due to the service, food was alright nothing too horrible to be complained about. I got there wanting to ask for a menu to look while I wait in line, they do have a standing menu in front of the door but I was at the back of the line. The lady had extra menu but then decide not to give me and ask me to look at the one in the front of the door. And I saw other customers have the menu too, so she just don't wanna give me one? Later when she assign us to our table, she was being completely cold and ignorant as well, simply pointed at the seat over a crowded place, so I did no know which table to be exact she was pointing at, then she some what raised her voice too.  Besides the rude front door lady, our waitress was nice. The food came about 20 min later or so, Waffle a bit too sweet, fries good and the egg Benedict with salmon is a bit fishy and the tomato dressing isn't so impressive
Great burger! But make sure your whole group is there before you try to get a table.
Stopped in about 10:30p - stated on yelp they closed at 12. I ordered the ribeye bone in - medium rare - it was extremely dry.  The service was borderline terrible. They pretty much tried to push us out the minute we sat. I was chewing my over priced dry steak and a server tried to remove it from in front of me. I would not go back - I recommend 212 or Keen's over this.
Touristy spot. Food mediocre but cooked consistent. Exactly what you would expect on Times Square. Staff was friendly and service was quick. If you want a fast and easy meal check it out.
From the outside the sign doesn't do it justice. The food inside is amazing. We tried the fish congee and the fish tacos. They tasted fresh, delicious and big portions and we're definitely coming back soon! What sold us was the friendliness of the staff - Amanda the bartender/server was helpful and warm and also meeting Jeff was fun and welcoming. Thanks for the birthday shots for my wife!
Excellent Food and great service. The lobster roll I had there was fabulous and so was the clam chowder. Great atmosphere as well. I will definitely be coming back to this location. Definitely deserves a 5 star review!
Totally not worth any sort of wait. I was quoted 40 minutes, probably waited 50-55 on a Saturday at 6:15PM. We were seated around 7:05PM, and ordered the Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles/spicy noodles), which is my standard dish that I like to order at various Thai restaurants to compare. It was nothing special. My friend and I also ordered the braised ribs - that was pretty delicious, and she thought her dried noodles were ok. Overall, I would not come back!
My friend took me to the DUMBO. At the middle of the travel, we took a rest, eating the Taste Of Maine as a snack. I don't like the slaw but the roll is nice.
"Amazing soup dumplings that actually have soup in them as opposed to other dumplings that claim to be ""Xiaolongbao"" --  Yes, you only get four but the size of each are almost equal the six you can get at other dim Sum joints...  All in all -- fast service, not pretentious and reasonably priced makes this a ""repeatable/ regular "" place for future dumpling cravings !!"
One of the better spots for BBQ in NY, hidden in Redhook, Brooklyn. I appreciate the process of going up to the cashier and having the food already prepared and served instantly. Tried the brisket, pulled pork with a side of mac and cheese, cole slaw and a slice of corn bread. Let's talk about the meat first.. the pulled pork is my favorite because of the flavor and tenderness. Brisket is a little dry but they have an assortment of sauces to dip in. Mac and cheese was deliciously cheesy and cole slaw was refreshing as a side. The corn bread definitely stole the show when it comes to sides, totally worth the $4 a square. It was just the right amount of sweetness and I just couldn't stop myself bite after bite. Can't wait to come back until the next BBQ craving.
Ok. First of all, be ready to wait. Secondly, let me tell you: it's worth the wait! I had the pork bun and a ramen (don't remember which one), it was amaaaaaazing!!! The pork bun was so perfect, the noodles are made in-house if I remember right. I wish I could come back to New York just to have visit Ippudo! Don't hesitate to go here!
One of my favorites ramen places! It's honestly better than a lot of the other ones I've tried. Their soup is flavorful, not too salty or heavy, and you get a lotta noodles so it's worth the price! I really like the tonkatsu ramen. Their lunch special is pretty good as you get a small ramen, zuke dish and kimchi for $16. The zuke is basically a rice dish with fish sashimi or they have other meat options too. I got the zuke don which had tuna, nori (seaweed), and scallions. It's soy marinated so that one was pretty salty for me and I felt that it had a kinda strong wasabi taste too. The only down side about this place is the seating, especially if you go with one or two other people. Usually, you'll be seated next to strangers since they mostly have those long tall tables, and the seats are high. But I love their ramen so much it makes up for it haha
This is old school steak house. The servers are very noticeable and provide good service. you can just show up and line up without a reservation, but having one is highly recommended.  If you are driving there is a free parking lot for dinning just down the block right off the Williamsburg bridge.  The steak option is simple. choose steak for the number of people. The beacon is also tasty.  Bring cash they will not accept credit cards except their credit card, who has that? Just bring cash! The steak is good and service is good. If you haven't been it's worth going once and be sure to bring a lot of cash for your meal.
Dear ROTI Quality Control Department: Please do a site visit to this location. Crunchy, undercooked rice, overcooked vegetables, disinterested and unprofessional staff are repeat features of this shop. Unlike the midtown location, which has always been spot-on, this location needs some grownups on-site to make sure that the corporate standards are being adhered to. While I feel that Naya Express has slightly better food, I prefer Roti due to the unlimited vegetable/sides deal. But the ways things have been the last 2 time, I'll be hitting Dig Inn, Potbelly and Field's Chicken before I go back here. ROTI Maiden Lane: step up your game!
This was just perfect in every way. You walk in to a welcoming room and are warmly greeted. They gently escort you through this flower and art filled space and to your table. The surroundings are exquisite. Add to this perfectly fresh ingredients cooked to perfection. Beautiful presentation. Service almost anticipated my needs before I realized them. A classic.
One star for the view. I agree with another review about arriving hungry and leaving hungrier......Portions are small. We were a party of four, on 8/16/17 the hostess that seated  us for our 530pm RESERVATION tells us we must be done by 7pm.  Thought that was rather rude.
Pizza was fantastic as was the service. Coming from South Florida I was stoked to try NY pizza, this place is what I thought it would be down to the tv like character manager who sat us.  My tip for out of towners is call to get the correct address. This address listed on Yelp will take you nowhere because the road is blocked off for outside seating. After searching for this place for 20 min and decided to call , the hostess told us a different address listed on Yelp.  Took us so long to get there even though we were essentially in their parking lot. They gave away our table and we were stuck outside in the rain. However, we had a great time regardless and the food was awesome.
"Let me start with saying I have being spoiled by Somtum Der, which was recently awarded a one Michelin star, and all the other amazing Thai places in Manhattan (Kiin Thai eatery, Pinto, etc.). I have certain standard for Thai - basically just that I don't like bland Thai dishes. SO if my review sounds overly hash, do my a favor, go eat at Somtum Der.  After watching a movie nearby, we did our research and decided to give this place a try. We got here around 6:30pm on a Saturday night, it was already pretty busy. Luckily a table was just leaving so we only had to wait for a little over 5min to be seated. We got the Thai spare ribs, spicy noodle with shrimp and pad thai with chicken. Thai spare ribs were very well flavored, meat was juicy and tender and fell right off the bone.  Unfortunately, it just went downhill from there. My spicy noodle was a complete failure: (1) it was not spicy AT ALL, (2) it lacked the complex flavors from Thai dishes I'm used to, and (3) shrimp in there was definitely NOT fresh and it had certain ammonia after taste. To be fair, our waiter did ask whether I wanted spicy sauces, so I guess at least they acknowledge that ""spicy noodle"" was not spicy. Pad Thai, in comparison to spicy noodle, was better. Instead of being bland, it was overly vinegary. I've never tasted any Pad Thai being that sour.  Once again, not trying to sound like a snob, but this proves my theory that due to lack of competition in BK, I need to discount ratings by at least one star for a restaurant. In this particular case, a four-star Thai place in Cobble Hill is probably equivalent to a 2 star in Manhattan. The positive? Two drinks, one appetizer and two entrees, the total bill with tip was less than $70. THAT is something Manhattan cannot compete with. But I'd rather pay up and enjoy something way better."
This is more like 3.5 stars but I'm rounding down. Whatever. The food was absolutely delicious, but the service was meh. We had a reservation at 9, weren't seated until about 9:20 ish, which was annoying as it was a rainy night and I was soaked upon arrival. Our server was attentive enough, but he was very stiff and cold in his demeanor. He never smiled or really introduced himself to us at all. But again, it was okay because the food was so great. I came in with my boyfriend for his birthday, and a disappointing factor was that, when I called to confirm that we were celebrating a birthday, the hostess told me they would put a candle in whatever dessert we ordered. That never happened which really bothered me, but again, whatever. I might come back, as maybe it was just an off night. But, if anything, I will say that the music selection was on point.
I got a carne asada taco. Mine was so loaded that all the fillings were spilling out.  The spice level was really good though. For the price it was good since there was so much filling, maybe if the tortilla was bigger in proportion to the filling it would have made my experience better.
They may have great ramen, but I wouldn't know.  Went this past Sunday exactly at 12pm when they supposedly opened, only to find a sign saying they would open at 1230pm.  Mind you, it was sideways rain and windy, and the workers hanging out inside didn't bat an eye lash when they saw 8-10 people outside peering in.  Things happen, so we went next door and had a tea to kill 30 mins.  Upon returning, they reprinted their Microsoft windows flyer saying the opening time was now 1pm!  Again, no explanation or customer service as a man with a baby stroller sat outside in the pouring rain.  Someone should tell these people they're on Atlantic avenue and they're not Ippudo.   Stay away.   I know I won't be returning.
"Very popular spot. It's CASH ONLY, but they accept reservations, and you'll need one on weekend evenings, or prepare for a long wait.  The place is very informal, and you smell seafood as soon as you walk in. We had a few appetizers and a main.  Catfish basket: the quality of the fish was good, but it was not crunchy, and the fries underneath were soggy.  Crab cake: again, good quality of the fish, but poor execution...too dry.  Oyster sliders: although the oysters were tasty, the concoction of flavors didn't work well.  Brussel sprouts: very good...crispy and savory/sweet.  King crab legs with ""The Boil"" sauce, medium spice: I don't have king crab often, so it was kinda of a treat. There's a good amount of meat, but prepare to work hard for it. You do get covered in plastic and wear plastic gloves, but those legs will give you a workout! The sauce is VERY garlicky... Overall, although we ordered only 1 main, the appetizers added up, and our dinner was over $100. For the type of food and the quality of the dishes, I don't feel I would go back."
Ordered from here via Post Mates - absolutely disgusting. I ordered the pasta carbonara, rice ball and salad...never again.
Was a little disappointed. Note, nice atmosphere, great service but food was just okay. No wow factor. I had the mixed greens and the monkfish, good, not great. My friend had the grilled octopus which I tried and have had much better, was a little tough and not much flavor. My other friend has fusilli and pork ragu, tried that and it was very good. All I kept thinking was how much I miss Petit Oven. Their brunch menu looks really good and I may go back to try that but sad to say this place was just so so. Also, if they are going to charge these prices, food needs to improve.
These guys seriously suck. I've ordered from them about 5 times via Eat24 and spent at least $50 each time. All of a sudden when I order they call me saying that they can't deliver to me because they can't find my address. Umm hello you've delivered to me 5 times with out a problem. They continued to whine about not being able to find it and I'm like I am a MILE away from your restaurant. She then said there's another location that they will have to transfer my order and reprimanded me that I need to order from them. Hello, they're pickup only!!! I'm sorry that you're so lazy to deliver a mile away just because it's windy. Never again will I order from you again. LEARN PROPER CUSTOMER SERVICE AND GIVE ME MY $60 BACK!!!!!!!
I absolutely love how consistent Buttermilk Channel is with the quality of their food. I've been here 3 times and the pork chop with waffles is always my go to dish, The wait for brunch is quite long (usually 30-45 minutes) if you don't make it to the first round. However, it is absolutely worth the wait! If you want to avoid the wait, I suggest trying to come as soon as they open. I got here about 30 minutes after the opening time and was able to snag the last bar seat.  Eggs Huntington- These were just okay. I feel like it should have came with a thick slice of ham rather than the thin slice. The hollandaise sauce could have been better. Fried Pork Chop and Cheddar waffles- This dish was definitely the star of the show! The pork chop was delicious and fried to perfection. It paired perfectly well with the waffles and syrup. Pecan Pie French Toast- This was delicious! However, I wish there was an option to order a smaller side of this dish. To sum things up, definitely get the Fried pork chop and cheddar fries! The portions are quite large, so bring a friend or two and sample multiple dishes.
The  more than 8000 reviews say enough. Go here. Try it. Amazing. Broth is always on point. The appetizers are good not the best but the appetizers aren't why you come here anyways.  Tip: come early or else don't be surprised by a 1.5 hour wait.
Small dishes, maybe Little pricey. Nice ambiance with plants, goldfish& turtle ponds, running water sound with pebble stone walk ways.  I ordered fried oysters and fish tacos. They were spicy and tasty; not too much food for one - just enough.  If you are staying, the process to order food is cleverly setup: you first open a tab at the bar where they put your name in the system, then you go around to order your food where they look you up by your name and add your food to your tab.  Once the food is ready, they txt you, so you can come back for the pick, so you don't have to wait by the kitchen.  The only improvement suggestion so far is to get the kitchen staff on board with customer service. They need to smile and be more personable especially to those first timers with questions . Also, not sure if I like the smoking part in back!!
Mu Ramen is absolutely on my list of Top 5 ramen places in the city. It's a short walk from the 7 train in LIC, the service is so helpful and friendly, and the food is amazing!  I came here with a group of three after work (about 6:30) and didn't have to wait at all. The crowd definitely picked up as the evening went on though. We ordered the Kuro Edamame, Okonomiyaki, Mu Ramen, and Tonkatsu ramen, all of which I highly recommend - the Kuro Edamame is a must order though. It's charred to perfection and dusted with chilis, salt, and deliciousness. I also highly recommend the Crack Kimchi if you're looking to kick your ramen up a notch. It's extremely spicy but is served on the side, so you can add it in to your bowl as you please.
Aaamazing food... had Asada Taco and Asada Quesadilla. Line  was long but service was super  Fast.  Food was super flavorful! They had best sauces. I would come here everyday if I could.
I am so sorry I have to give 2 stars. I came to Chimu twice. My first experience was really great, good foods and I had a really a good time. So I told my friend that I wanted to come back again and I am going to bring my boyfriend because he never tried before. So, they were five of us and as usual, they were busy and that's good. So, the server asked if we wanted to seat outside the garden and it had heats and everything. We decided to seat outside the garden. We ordered foods and drinks but 10 mins later, it started to rain. So we went back inside, the server and manager ( I think) were really nice. They got us a table in 6-10 mins. We were fine until the foods were served.  One of the food runners dropped the whole skirt steak on the floor and spilled on the my boyfriend's shirt. I know they were busy but please be careful. The food runner had three hot skirt beef platters on his right and left arms.My boyfriend was really upset and so do we. We ordered seafood paella and it was not a good as we first came. I think they were so busy at that and please do not come in the weekend.  It was a great place but I think the food runners should be extremely becareful.
Fette Sau is great. Love the inside and the rustic feel. Really nice people work the joint. The prices are a but high for my taste but probably par for the course compared to other spots in the area. Brisket goes about $29/lb, pulled pork at $24/lb, and sides around $4-9. The pulled pork is awesome. Nice and smokey with big chunks, not all shredded to hell. The brisket is also good but a little less flavorful than i would like. The burnt parts of skin on the brisket is awesome thought.  The burnt end beans. Oh the beans. My favorite thing ever. And these ones are amazing. With some Hawaiian sweet rolls. For $7. Makes me a happy happy man. The beans are where its at.  Overall i come here whenever I'm in the area. Very quality bbq. Great sides. And decent price.
This place is totally over-rated! I went here for their lunch special based on their yelp reviews and was disappointed with the quality and quantity of their food. Small portions, and their appetizers include a macaroni salad (like, really?!). I was so grossed out. Their kimchi seemed old and too acidic like it was about to go old. I didn't feel good eating their food. The meat didn't seem fresh, either.  Maybe it was just their lunch special. I've never tried their korean BBQ but don't think I'll be back. Would not recommend to a friend.
Great atmosphere and delicious foods. Wonderful services. We had brunch on Sunday  at Benemon and the lunch menu are a great deal. The right proportion size not too much. I would come back again with my whole family again. Sunday is better because of easily available parking spaces around the neighborhood .
First visit was awesome but second visit was with a group and experience was horrible. Pizza is amazing.  Service sucks.  Either they just want to have only locals come or they are straight up racist since we were the only diverse table in the place. There was another group who came after us yet were served right away. Im never coming here again. I live in NYC for a reason if I wanted to be treated that way I would move to the suburbs!
Had really high expectations based on yelp reviews. Came here on Sat night with my family and was extremely disappointed. Menu is extremely limited and I was surprised not to see any specials, especially on a Saturday night. Food is mediocre, at best. Tried pretty much everything on the menu, as previously stated menu is limited. Service was HORRIBLE. Not only were they understaffed but it was very slow and unprofessional. Prior to writing this review, I glanced thru posted pictures just as a comparison. I don't know what the deal is but lot's of the dishes posted here were not available, perhaps they have lunch or brunch specials. Two things that I did enjoy were the decor and the live Jazz performance.  ADVICE TO OWNER: IF YOU WANT TO CHARGE REASONABLE PRICES FOR FOOD, TRAIN YOUR STAFF.
EHHHHH, just okay. Basically an outdoor dive bar with a view. Cash only. Blah food.
Food is good and portions are generous. Pricey for Korean food, especially during dinner or weekends. The male waiter is rude in his attitude (waitresses are nice), and he was forgetful of items like miso soup and rice that was supposed to come with meal.
Super duper good. The pasta was extremely fresh and the ambience was perfect. Will definitely be back for the raviolis.
After reading the reviews and seeing the photos I thought I would check this spot out. Upon arrival we were informed that there would be a 30 min wait for a table or we could eat at the bar.  So we ordered a margarita pizza and sat at the bar.  We got a bottle of what appeared to be homemade seltzer with decent fizz and it was only like $4 so cool.  We were given some pizza dough sticks and olive oil while we waited. They weren't great but it was a nice gesture.  About 30 minutes later we were informed that there was a mistake and our order would be out soon.  Ok cool.  They were nice and honest about the mistake. I can respect that.  Finally the pizza arrives and well?  The crust/dough was too chewy and a little under done. The cheese was not fully melted and were basically flavorless chewy marbles of cheese. The sauce lacked texture as there were no chunks of plum tomato or anything else. I found that the sauce not only lacked texture but, had no depth of flavor or brightness or sweetness or really much of any flavor at all quite frankly.  I see others writing fantastic reviews for this place and I just don't get it.  5 stars is reserved for places like Di'Fara's or Posto or maybe Patsy's. I am very sorry but this is just not even in the same league.  The space is really nicely done and the people were super nice but I came for 4 or 5 star pizza and honestly didn't even get close.
There was a lot of talk about this restaurant but honestly I think it is overrated and overpriced. I do not mind spending big money on delicious food especially in NYC but the Heidi house was a little less than mediocre. To start out the man who acted as the host and waiter was not very warm or inviting and he did not tell us any of the specials. My boyfriend and I ordered the crab dip to start out with and it had an overwhelming horseradish flavor (way too much horseradish). I had the lobster mac and cheese which was overcooked and my boyfriend ordered the paella which I preferred to my own dish. We had several wines (I believe I had the Malbec and Cab Sav) which were good.  Overall, okay experience, but not worth the hype.
"I love In-N-Out burger so this does not cut it.  Burgers are ""ok"", fries taste frozen with lots of salt. I will pass next time since I am spoiled over here in California with quick access to In-N-Out burgers. Lines are just as crazy as In-N-Out- and there is also fast friendly service at both places. But the freshness, quality and taste won't work for me since In-N-Out rocks! Sorry."
We've been here three times, the last two were poor experiences.  The prix fixe, which was presented to us as a good deal, had very small portions. The greens were good, but the seafood was undercooked and bland. We don't eat much, but we left hungry.  The most recent time, we had the burger. First off, the french fries weren't fully cooked. Some fries were completely cool to the touch. The hamburger was maybe 2/3 of the actual bun, and was overcooked and underseasoned. We also had the brussel sprouts which were delicious. After the first bite of fries, I wanted to just get the cheque and leave.  This place has beautiful decor and presentation, but the food just doesn't taste good. The waitstaff was great, though. After three tries, I won't be back here.  COOK YOUR FRIES!
Get here early if you'd like to grab a spot at the bar! By 7:30 pm on a Friday, my group of four had a tough time finding a spot and got jostled around quite a bit. I'm not sure why this place is so well known-I found the drinks to be expensive and the atmosphere was nothing special.
I remember the frozen Mojitos as amazing, but now they taste really chemically and like they're made with a cheap mix. Not sure what's up, but not the gem I remember. Almost undrinkable.
"Out of all the restaurants reservations that were booked for my trip, this was the one I was looking most forward to. I'd eaten here before, and I needed to reaffirm that this was among the best steakhouses I've visited. Yeah, it didn't disappoint. Even though I made a reservation, I still had to wait for about 30 minutes. Not a big deal, but just something to expect if you have a reservation. Iceberg Wedge Salad - Super refreshing, considering the heat and humidity that day. It was topped with a generous portion of bacon and bleu cheese. Langer's Sizzling Bacon - A must-order item every time. Cooked to perfection. Crispy, salty, thick.... Just everything you'd imagine times 100. German Fried Potatoes - I ordered this instead of the fries, and I'm glad I did. They were a little dry, but the crunch and the onion flavor complemented the steak. Onion Rings - Full onion pieces that were well breaded. Delicious. Steak for Two - A huge thick portion cooked a perfect medium rare. Melt in your mouth goodness that is simply unmatched. Peter Luger really does know steak, hands down. Here's a tip: Don't get the steak for three or four. Get two orders of the steak for 2. Why? Because the steak for four isn't that much bigger of a steak-- an inch thicker, tops. Two steaks for 2 = you're swimming in steak!  The server was courteous, and at one point brought us a portion of creamed spinach, which we didn't order. We informed him that we hadn't ordered it, but he placed it on the table and said ""Hey what the heck, it's Father's Day! It's on the house"". Little gestures like these go a long way. I mentioned reservations in the beginning, but it's really important to make sure you get a confirmation about it from them over the phone. After making my reservation a month in advance, I got a call from them confirming it. This is crucial- I saw at least one party get turned away because the host could not find their reservation. Whether this is on the patron or the restaurant, I'm not sure, but at a restaurant like this its best to have assurances and guarantees instead of being turned away or waiting for 2+ hours without a reservation."
We were strolling through Brooklyn Bridge Park and stumbled onto Luke's. I was excited and my wife said we had to try it. Fair enough. I love sandwiches. I like seafood. But here's the thing: when I pay $17 for a sandwich, I expect it to be filling. I know, I know... its fresh lobster. I get it. I just expected a little more for the price. The bread is good. The lobster is good. The chips were good. All good. I just wanted a bigger sandwich for the price. But seriously: its worth trying. Everything was top quality. Very simple and straight-forward. She loved it. I was pleased with the food but not with the cost. Not saying I wouldn't go back, though.
I've heard it's the best pizza in Brooklyn , but Hell NO I refuse to wait in this insane line for an hour !!!! so every time I'm in dumbo I'm checking the line and hallelujah no line today , probably cause it was too cold.  We've ordered the large pizzas with extra topping and waited patiently to try the best pizza in New York . To be honest , nothing is amazing about this pizza , Just a regular slices with yummie cheese and thin crust but that's all ! Nothing special about it . It was good but over rated for sure .
You won't be disappointed visiting Ugly Baby. Pure, authentic, unapologetic Thai cuisine. This restaurant has the potential to become one of the most well regarded Thai establishments in NYC ... which is full of Thai restaurants. This stands out above and beyond the rest. Be sure to try the Kao Soy, pork shoulder and definitely attempt the brutally spicy beef dish!!
Ramen is of my favorites so I had to try this place. Came to the Westside location on the recommendation of a friend who works in the food industry and love it. Walked in alone around 5:45 and got seated immediately at the bar. Great wait staff and very efficient. Love the atmosphere of the U-Shaped bar.  Akamaru Modern Ramen was great. The broth was nice and creamy and loved the edition of the soft boiled egg. Would definitely return on a future trip to New York.
Usually I never write reviews but I am so furious.  Worse customer service ever! I always give at least 15% tip. They added 18% gratitude because there's seat for5 people. The fifth person is a 2 year old who doesn't eat.  No place I've been to add tip like this.  The waiter looks at us and being Asian she probably think we won't tip.  I am so angry for this insult.  The tall skinny female waiter is very rude and extremely late at waiting you after you sat down.  The waiters were talking bad about our table when I asked them to fix the check for the added tip.  That is the most unprofessional service I've had up to this date.  Food was ok mainly sweet, good presentation. I've had better basil fried rice elsewhere.  The appetizers are decent but main course don't order too much because all you taste will be sugar. I was going to order desert but I'm feeling too sugary.
Absolutely love this place! Been there a dozen times and have yet to be disappointed. There are 2 locations. Both have identical menu. My standard order is a lb of snow crab and a lb of king crab with sides of sausage and corn (for 2 of course). I get it with the boil sauce medium spicy. The boil sauce is this garlicky spicy goodness that goes great with all seafood. Shrimp and crawfish are ok, but I'm more into the crab. Lots of other sides and main dishes to try. But if it's your first time get at least a lb of crab in a bag and get messy!
Mediocre - food and service  Went there for lunch with coworkers. The restaurant is a bit cozy.  Had to wait a couple min before getting a table as the waiters were all running around.  Appetizer- eh, was a miss.  Chicken larb was tasteless.  About 2 spoonful of grounded chicken meat on a bed of lettuce. Papaya salad had a little bit of seasoning, but not very enjoyable.  Main dish - fried chicken on a bed of ginger rice, served with sweet chili sauce. The ginger rice was interesting as it was the first time I've seen it on a menu.  It didn't have enough ginger, and the rice was slightly dry, but otherwise it was still tasty.  Chicken was okay.  Without the sweet chili sauce, the chicken would have been too bland.  Coworkers ordered:  Chicken pad Thai-had enough flavor. This was easily the best of all of the dishes. Pad see ew with chicken- was okay, nothing amazing  Lychee Thai ice tea - I love the presentation with the rose on the straw.  This was just lychee juice and Thai tea combo, but I liked how dark the tea flavor was. It was too sweet, had to dilute it with water.  Will most likely not return for a second visit.
I live close by. The brunches look popping but I've only been for dinner and for a drink. The food is pretty good. The menu isn't too large of a selection but apparently it's the place to be because it's always pretty crowded! The service is good. Overall a good experience.
Nice atmosphere...back room would be great for an event or any large group and nice loud music.  However, this has its downfalls. We were a group of four and stuck in the very back corner of the big room which resulted in incredibly lack-luster service. Our waiter basically forgot about us and we had to flag down any one we could to order, get more beverages, and get the check. Each time our real waiter would come by and ask if we were ready to order well after we had been tired of waiting and placed our order with someone else. Lack of communication with staff here is apparent.  Food was decent...the MAD calamari was good but not very crispy and smaller portion. Had the chicken parm which came with a small side of pasta, my friend had the salmon which was huge and good.  Overall would come back but only for a large group dinner.
"This was the third time we visited this place and it just got worse with each time (there won't be a fourth time). I can tell you that the ambience is great--the garden adorable. However the food and the service is a whole different story. We (my friend and I) were walking around the neighborhood, with some coffee but figured that we were hungry and went into the restaurant to grab some lunch. As soon as we went in, we were greeted in a very awkward manner..as if the waitress was forced to greet us? Anyway, we were ""seated"" aka the waitress stood with a pissed off expression as we picked our seats. But it turned out the ceiling was dripping with unidentified water droplets??? So we just moved ourselves to a different seat close to the window. Now the food came--a spaghetti dish and a fish dish with spinach. The spaghetti was so overly salty so we had to dilute the saltiness with the spinach from the other dish. However, the saltiest being within this restaurant was the waitress. Now, remember how we went in with our coffee from a different shop? She kept on asking if she could take it or if we were finished with it when she could clearly see that there was coffee left in the cup. I can see how bringing an outside beverage can be annoying. But the lunch was spontaneous and we couldn't just throw away the drinks just to please the waitress and make her (assumably) already bad day less bad. Plus..we ordered 2 significant dishes--it's not like we ordered one salad to share. Anyway..I could feel her bitter aura throughout the meal (so could my friend) and it was so unnecessarily uncomfortable.  On top of the abstract attitude, every time we asked for something, a spoon or the check, she kind of threw it on the table..which is never pleasant.  I kept on returning because of the atmosphere and the hopes of less salty food and (less salty) waitress but I hit my limit and will not be returning..not that they'll notice anyway."
Bad service!! I couldn't pull the waiter attention to order the drinks as he didn't care about my table at all. So when he finally came to us I had to choose what to order to eat as well cause we were going to be late to the airport. Of course because of that we didn't know about the pasta choice since he didn't told us and we had whatever we thought good in the menu. And to make it worse the time kept passing and thirty minutes passed and the glass of wine didn't show up. How hard it is to bring a glass of wine!!! So when the waiter came close, I asked him to not bring it anymore. And we were just waiting there forever for the one dish. Although the restaurant wasn't packed and it was a raining late afternoon lunch. I'm not going there again when I travel to NYC.
Came for a week night dinner with a couple girl friends. Considering the other options in the neighborhood, I expected much more for the food. Decor is kitchy and unique, but for sub-par pub grub so many other places to try out.
We made reservations for a 9:30pm table for 4 and we actually arrived early to pir reservation. We figured we would have to wait for our table to be ready at 9:30, but we did not anticipate having to wait almost 20 minutes past our reservation time to be seated. We were not escorted to your table until 9:48pm. The host staff was attentive to our need (and expectation) to get seated, however, never once apologized for the wait.  Once we sat down we felt a bit ignored by our server. Tables that had sat down after us received their menus and bread before we did. Maybe we were just placed in a poor location in the main dining room.  The food was very good and arrived quickly. We ordered the branzino and the spaghetti as well as the tuna appetizer, the beet salad, and the creamy polenta. All were solid choices.  After we had perused the dessert menu, to our dismay, the waiter informed us they were out of two desserts including the banana cake, which - of course - was the one we wanted! Wah wah  I must say, I was a fan of the beautiful, chic ambience of the restaurant. Definitely enhanced the dining experience! Unfortunately, I feel the level of service left more to be desired.
A hole in a wall with neighborhood charm that makes you feel like you belong. The raw oyster special was tasty and affordable on a Sunday evening. Prices were good, service was quick, and my fish tacos were delicious. ALSO, they gave a complimentary shot of Jamison because they didn't think the food was fast enough (10-15 minutes). I love that the glass door was broken and the tables were all mismatched and scuffed up, but you can kick back, relax, and enjoy great food with a happy, upbeat environment.
Delicious food! Super nice attention! Try the meedorang, the coconut rice is delicious!! And the curry laksa!  All amazing!! And outdoor seating and pet friendly!
We discovered this restaurant on line as we were going to a show at Carolines and wanted to be nearby. The restaurant is sparsely decorated but very tasteful. We ordered a reasonably priced pinot gregio and enjoyed the delicious bread and the small plate of assorted olives. We had the watermelon salad , a special of the night.  The various greens were delightful. My wife had the rigatoni foccia and I had the rigatoni alla trecolori. Both were the perfect size and were delicious . My wife had the poached pears and I had the fruit with cream. They were a fitting end to a good meal. My only criticism was that the air conditioning was way to high and with the extremely high humidity the room was  overly warm at times. Would defintely come back.
Okay good  Good service and def worth a try to go! I wouldn't rush to get here but okay!
Great ramen for the financial district area. Although relatively small, there is a good amount of seating for couples or small groups of people. I came here around lunch on a weekend and was seated immediately. I ordered the Sapporo ramen and it was really delicious. The broth was super flavorful and almost creamy, noodles were plenty and al dente. There were so many yummy mixins like the corn, arugula, scallions, half egg, ground pork and chasu. Overall, a great bowl of ramen.
I've been here multiple times and the food and service here is usually on point.  My last time here, I ordered the Pad Kee Mao with tofu and and it was some of the worst I've ever had. The onions, peppers and garlic bits had a burnt taste and the tofu was very tough and hard to chew. My friend got the red curry and it was delicious.  The staff here is super pleasant and you get a free small Thai iced tea for checking in. They also have outdoor seating in the summer and let us sit out there for as long as we wanted without hinting at us to leave.
Their pizza is the main reason why I keep coming into this spot. They offer a variety of pizzas, but you can also make your own. All the ingredients are first class. However,  sometimes it gets packed and the wait is a bit terrifying. But the wait is really worth it. Great spot for hangout. I might say this is one of the pizza spots here in NY.
Went Sunday evening a little after 5. Read some yelp comments about the waiting list and the little white board in front so have no trouble putting our name down and waited outside. We came just at the right time as the 3-4pm brunching crowd (?) were vacating and before the 5-6pm dinner crowd hits. Three groups of people showed up right after us. We waited less than 15 mins and was seated at the bar.  For drinks we had a cocktail made with sweet tea and bourbon. It was strong and smooth. We then went straight for the chicken. I opted for the extra hot which I slightly regretted later and my boyfriend got the hot. We also got several sides including collard greens, slaw, mac and cheese and loaded grits.  The service speed could be slightly faster but we got our food and it was fresh and piping hot (in the best way ever). The Hot chicken specialities came with three pieces of chicken (1 dark and 2 white), a piece of white bread underneath, a piece of cornbread and a couple slices of pickles on the side. Standard Nashville setup. We almost burnt ourselves on our first bite but it was all worth it. So juicy and so crispy, loaded with flavors. The spice level built up after a while for my extra hot and the surrounding area of my mouth also started to burn but the chicken was so good I could not stop!  The sides were good overall. The collard greens were nice and vinegary. The slaw was crunchy but drenched in mayo (it killed the heat for me). The mac and cheese was nothing really special though. However, the loaded grits. That grits is the BOMB. Putting bacon, scallion and cheese on a spoon full of creaminess.  Highly recommended for chicken lovers!  P.S. Can't lie. I am still dreaming about the chicken. I had my last piece for breakfast this morning. Obviously the batter and skin were no longer crispy but the flavor though. Still on my top chicken list!
Best Tacos in NYC! Possibly anywhere - and I've had a lot of tacos all over Mexico. Carne Asada - quesadillas, with corn tortillas are the best.
Ive been here 4 times, and I've been to a place similar to the boil but there's no comparison to the Boil.  *Snow crab legs *king crab legs *lobster roll *corn and potatoes Drinks: Frenchman and watermelon lemonade w/ ciroc. Overall good!
I use to come here when I was in secondary school. Those were the good times, when the dumplings were a dollar and when it actually taste decent. Now my experience at Vanessa s seems deteriorate with every visit. The dumpling skins are too thick and the sauces on the tables are always watered-down. I guess when restaurant started to become more of a franchise the quality of food went down with it.
$ 20 for lobster?!? Comes with salad AND fries?!?! What a steal how can you not go to this place?? Love the simple menu, staff is super friendly, and food tastes great. Great value for the amount and quality of food you get. Restaurant is clean, spacious, and has a nice ambiance. The lobster was delicious. Tried the steamed and the grilled lobster and both were great (although I preferred the steamed a little more than the grilled because it was more succulent). The lemon garlic butter with the lobster just melts in your mouth. It was absolutely amazing.The meal comes with a nice light salad and golden crispy fries!  The lobster roll was equally as divine as the lobster. The bread was warm, buttery and soft with a slight crisp to it. The lobster inside was creamy and tender.  Great experience over all, I need to come back to get more lobster!
Why are you here other than the fact that you are coming for their famous soup dumplings? If it's to be around the street with a history of chinese gang shootings, then continue along. Otherwise, come here for shanghai food!  Super fast, quick paced and good turnover for seats, I luckily didn't have to wait on a weekday before 7 PM. Past 7, there were lines that were starting to form.  XLB: I LOVE IT. Great huge XLB with plenty of soup in it. Stellar, worth it. I really enjoy the regular XLB versus the other variations.  Scallion Pancakes: Damn freshly fried pancakes, you do me in. Love it, definitely a great appetizer.  Shanghai Rice Cakes: Ahh.. this is sounding repetitive. Delicious and tasty. Only thing were the noodles were a bit on the oily side.  Broad Noodles: Also quite delicious - plenty of pork mixed in with the noodles. Szechuan Style String Beans: I loved these. Other places I went to do an ok job with this dish, but damn was this amazing. While I loved all the food I ate here, this was actually my standout dish.  Loved eating here, sadly I can't just come here everyday. Overall, it isn't that overly expensive for their food and drinks.  RUN HERE.
I arrived at Jacob's Pickles with the recommendation of brother and it did not disappoint. On a Saturday night, the establishment was packed to the brims, but no matter. I ordered the Chicken & Pancakes, which was delicious, and my brother approved of the Baby Back Ribs as well. And true to form, the portions were enormous, so you know you get the value that you pay for. My only complaint - if you could call it that - was that the lighting was very very dim, and the music/overall ambiance quite loud, so the experience didn't really make for an intimate conversation. Regardless, this is a restaurant that I would definitely recommend to those who haven't been. A standout in the Upper West Side.
Went under a friends reservation, service staff seemed a little cold and impersonal but we shrugged it off as being a New York vibe. Our server Mika, was good. She was very friendly and seemed genuinely happy to have us as guest. Drinks arrived within less than 10 mins. Perfect timing for our flow of conversation (delicious negroni). Started with the Vitello (amazing, I will admit I have a weakness for veal so that's a bit of a biased opinion), fluke (okay, but nothing to write home about), Margherita pizza was outstanding, period. We decided to stick with the classics for our mains: lamb ragu, surprisingly not gamey at all, a hint of sweetness and a slight touch of spice which made the pasta delightful, lobster spaghetti was satisfying flavors worked really well together perfect texture, chicken was delicious, temperature of steak was on point. Dessert was so comforting. Tiramisu was subtle and sweet and the texture of the lady fingers were just as I expected. Profiteroles were outstanding, period, that ice cream was to die for! Overall my experience was a positive one and I would return! Don't forget to take a walk out back after your meal, amazing views!!!
"As a former server, bartender, hostess and manager--wow. never have i been so astonished and offended. Terrible beyond horrifying service. Was accused by the manager of doing drugs in her establishment. And trust me I wouldn't be writing this review if that was even close to the truth. She kicked out both my friend and me, who were catching up on our summers over a couple of beers. When I asked her what the reason was for this, she responded, ""Honestly i think you're on drugs."" I guess all skinny women who go to the bathroom after a meal and 2 drinks are on drugs. I PAID my $70 bill, and I've regret it every day since.  If the owners care at all about customer service they've already fired this judgmental oaf of a manager who knows nothing about business or hospitality."
Came here for brunch on Memorial Day weekend with 3 friends.  Pros: We arrived 15 minutes earlier than our reservation but they were able to seat us right away. We ordered a bunch of food to share - the chicken and waffle sandwich (delicious - but a little dry, would have been great to have some maple syrup maybe?), the Mac and cheese (out of this world!!!), the sweet potato toast with goat cheese/avocado (amazing!), the shrimp and grits (also amazing, the pickled onions were a unique touch) and the cheddar grits (cheesiest I've ever had - so great). The food was served miraculously fast and the waitress was able to split our check 4 ways. Would definitely recommend. Cons: the only real issue we had was an ant problem. Immediately upon sitting down, my friend had to crush an ant on our table. Then while chatting, I noticed the half wall behind my friends head also had several ants crawling around - yuck! Makes me a bit nervous what the kitchen is like. Also, they sold out of the donut chicken sandwiches they've been heavily promoting by the time we ordered at 1:45 pm.  Overall great food and experience.
I came this place with my company team. Wow! Food is amazing! Especially, korean BBQ short Rib is so delicious. Fried Asparagus is yummy.
"If you are looking a cheap and cheerful happy hour near 8th street then this is the place to go.  I live a couple blocks away so am spoiled for choice when it comes to restaurants. Especially for early dinner around 6-6:30.  We walked in. They are busy with happy hour yet 1/2 empty with tables reserved for future potential reservations.  ""Do you have a table for two?"" -Silence. Walks away. Another person comes back says, yes, in 5 minutes,  We wait 5 minutes. They both come back.  -This table is reserved for 6.30 but you can sit there til they come then move to the bar.  It is 6.25. ""So you don't have a table"" - No  ""Ok, Thanks bye""  Walks one block way gets table at amazing Italian restaurant.  When someone asks you if you have a table, and does not have a reservation, they expect a simple yes or no answer not the run around.  It is ok to say no. It is not ok to waste people's time to just awkwardly stand in your doorway."
Came here for lunch on a weekday. The octopus in the polpo e patate was delicious, but whatever my pasta entree was, it was extremely underwhelming (and forgettable, apparently). Service was very, very slow even though the restaurant was maybe half-full, and not very informative. There are many other better Italian restaurants around, even in FiDi.
Do be aware that the weekday happy hour specials are not applicable on weekends, but do run until mid-afternoon on Saturdays as part of brunch.  I'm not sure when the happy hour pricing stops, my group didn't know that we were getting non-happy hour prices on the next round until we paid, not cool.  The kitchen closes between brunch and dinner (we weren't able to order food, unfortunately), but you can still come in and drink.  The sangria is really good, it's pretty much just wine and fruit.  Margaritas are also strong, and I saw someone ask for a mix of the 2, which looked interesting.
Last week, I went to this restaurant for the Taiwan ice. The waitress is really rude. I asked her if it's ok to change peanut to other staff like bible taro etc. ( if it's not it's ok) but she looks like very no patients to my question. And she gave me a poor bowl of so-called Taiwanese ice ( made by herself).  Horrible service. Never went there again.
Great potential. Speakeasy-like cocktails, but on the cheaper side ($10-11) as opposed to the normal $14-16. That being said, I don't think they offer enough variety. Most of the special cocktails are made with bourbon and rye... I always stick with gin when it comes to multi ingredient drinks but they only had 1-2 on the menu. The bartenders were fairly busy, and our particular one wasn't that friendly. We had to wave him over to order drinks, food, and eventually get the bill.  The kale slaw and beet salad were very good veggies options. The 3 cheese plate was really small for $16, and the cheese we chose were just okay. The deal breaker though was the heat. A few weeks ago I attempted to go to blueprint but when I walked in, was blasted with such hot stuffy air, I had to leave. I figured it was due to the unusually warm and humid October weather.  This time though it was just the same. We were literally sweating sitting at the bar. I have no idea why it's so damn hot in there but hopefully the fix it soon!
unfortunately, this was a disappointing stop. I've been here before and loved it, but it was years ago. perhaps my memory failed me or this was an off night, but 5-star restaurants should be 5-star at all times. the food was mostly very good, but it's very loud and the service was not on a par with the food our server was very perfunctory. not friendly at all. didn't ask if we needed any help with the menu or had any questions. took our drink order (no cocktail menu), but it took way too long for the drinks to come. it was weird. throughout the meal the service was very robotic all the food lived up to expectations, although I wouldn't order the steak again. would recommend the Argentine shrimp cerviche, seafood salad and branzino since I don't live in NYC anymore and only get to visit a few times a year, we'll probably take a pass on GBG. it's sad because I had such great memories of it.
Food was good, but the place is dirty and not well cared for.  Service was meh, especially given that we had a pretty substantial bill even before drinks. Ruined a very expensive pair of jeans because of gum under the table that was never cleaned up and they had no takeout bags for our extra food.  How hard is it to clean a table though? Overall disappointed.
Located in Little Italy, Rubirosa is a local's hidden secret!! It is small but can seat more people than you would think. A friend recommended it to me, and I will be sure to come back every time I visit the city!! The salads are huge, and are all delicious!  We stopped in for lunch and started with a couple salads for the table. After the rubirosa salad, I ordered a famous pizza of course. I chose the fresca with mushrooms added to it. The crust is very thin and the sauce is to die for! My boyfriend had one of their homemade pastas with meatballs in it, and really enjoyed it. All of their portions are a pretty big size, and I wish we would have shared an entree because I am not a leftovers kind of person!  Service was great from both the hostess and our server. I would definitely recommend this to anyone spending the day in the area.
My BF and I waited around 20 minutes on a weeknight, so not too bad. The dishes were kind of hit or miss but most were very tasty. I especially loved the short rib and the lamb chop was great. Didn't care for the cold octopus - the wasabi flavor was way too strong and I felt like it took away from the fish. Tempura zucchini was good, as were the chicken thigh skewers and gyoza, but overall we weren't too wowed. The short rib was definitely the standout. Decent service. 3.5 stars.
Oh my god. One of the best chinese food in New York! Prices are relatively cheap. I had the xiao long bao and wanton noodles (with soup). Although I came here with high expectations (thanks to my friends raving about it), almost every single one of them was met! I preferred the wantons over the xiao long baos, and personally think there's no need to get the noodles (just the wantons with soup will do). The prawns were really fresh and juicy!
You're basically paying for the view. Portions are small, not too big. Food was okay. Took forever to bring out each course as well as someone to notice we needed the check. Overall, probably wouldn't go here again although the view was gorgeous. 3 stars only bc they were friendly and gave a complimentary starter as well as some chocolates that came with the dessert. Oh and not to mention the delicious fly that was in my sprite. Waiter noticed and changed it immediately before I could even say anything.
Quick cafeteria style, but because of that the food is quite cold.  You choose your options and they weigh it by the pound, but they also have pre packed options that looked bomb.  Everything looked delicious but my favorites were the japchee (glass noodles), spicy pork, beef bulgogi with onions, and the kimchi fried rice.  Overall, It's a fantastic place to get fast and authentic korean food!
Banh mi #3 BBQ pork is so good but bulgogi is better... and viet coffee!! Pass on the chicken lemon grass--not a big fan of this flavor. I also keep staring at my neighbor's fries... If you sit down to eat, you'll notice at least 15 people enter and leave this place--it's so popular! Restrooms are clean.
Although I have loved Thirsty Koala in the past, I was disappointed to find that they have severely diminished their serving sizes. Today I ordered the gf calamari, which I have ordered in the past. When I got home and checked, I found that the serving was at least a third, if not half of the usual serving. I am including a picture for reference. Please feel free to compare to the pictures of servings posted in the past by other users. I understand if a business needs to raise their prices to keep up with cost, but to sell an item as being the same and diminishing the portion feels dishonest. The food may be good, but this left a bad taste in my mouth. I think I will think twice before ordering from there again.
Not a good experience. Which sucks cause the menu seems pretty great for brunch. We waited about 40 minutes after placing our order only to find out they forgot about our order. The place wasn't really busy and the staff was just kinda hanging around. In fact, since we got there I saw 3 different staff members actually sit down and eat while we were waiting for our food. Yet we're sitting there waiting and wondering what's taking so long. When the food finally arrived it was ok. Nothing special. One dish was missing avocado, one of the main ingredients. The place seems unorganized and inexperienced.  PS- don't sit towards the back, that's where the sink is...loudest dishwashing ever.
The food was good, the margaritas were great but the service was pretty bad.  I should maybe cut them a little slack being that I did go on Valentine's Day but considering that we were seated at 8:15 and didn't get our entrees until two hours later was unacceptable. We ordered off of a pre fixe menu that included one and a half hours of unlimited margaritas which I thought was good. The problem with that is that is was hard for us to even order drinks since our waitress would disappear for 5 - 10 mins at a time and then when we would get eyes on her, she would be on the other side of the restaurant so we weren't able to get her attention. At one point, the manager noticed that we were looking around a lot and he came over and took our drink orders.  We had the tacos langosta as an appetizer. We didn't get our appetizers until about 9pm which is 45 mins after we've been seated. We had the filet mignon a sour entrees but we didn't receive that until around 10:15 and that was after we asked how long it would take after ordering our entrees at around 9:40. I was a bit annoyed at this point so when our entrees came, I also asked for the bill. The waitress began to apologize and said that she will give us an extra hour on the unlimited drinks since we've waited so long.  On top of the long wait, it was pretty cold inside of the restaurant. A little bit too cold, as if their heaters were off.  I'll give this place two and half stars only because the food and drinks were good but otherwise, I doubt that I'll be visiting Toloache again.
Cool idea, my two favorite things plus french fries on the menu. Was super pumped.  Again, burger or lobster. Friend got a burger, I got the lobster. Both come with fries and a salad. Fries were 5/5, crispy, hot, delicious, salty Salad was 5/5: small, fresh, red onion and balsamic Lobster: they mass produce these giant lobsters and like I read in other reviews, mine was overcooked. I really didn't enjoy a single bite. Had to load up on the fries, which I wasn't too mad about. Burger: Giant, delicious, but nothing special about it. If you want to spend $20 on lobster or lobster roll, head down to Ed's lobster. Or Luke's. Not worth the $ here, folks.
This restaurant is amazing. At first we were a little upset at how long it took (25 min) to get a waiters attention..but then the manager came and apologized to us and got us a complimentary duck and the waiter was super attentive after that. The ambience and decor are both really nice and it really speaks to small details around the room. I did the restaurant week dinner, the calamari salad, the wagyu burger, and the peach cheesecake and the burger was my favorite!! It was so tasty and juicy. The calamari was great but there was some extremely bitter components of the salad (I think the purple cabbage?) that I just could not eat. The dessert was delicious but rather small and it didn't really have a cheesecake texture, it felt more whipped creamy than cheese caky. I tried my brothers Strawberry pie and it was on point  all the food is also very aesthetically pleasing.
Having surprisingly Never been to the St Marks original, which has different most mentioneds, we dropped by for Monday dinner. We requested and were seated in the enclosed back area, which adds a nice ambiance with some natural light and fauna. Service started off slow and remained that way. The vegetarian cous cous cannot be recommended, but the mixed grill was solid, albeit pricey for the fare @$22+.
I've been dreading coming here. It's been a year since I moved to New York, and what was once a twice a week ritual for me in Singapore came to a grinding halt. Why? New York is notorious for having sub par soup dumplings. I just needed this visit to finally confirm my suspicions. First of all what I noticed was that the dumplings are much too large to fit a Chinese soup spoon. Why does this matter? It means that you're likely to make a much bigger mess if you use the bite-a-hole-in-the-dumpling method while eating, the juices are more likely to fall all over a plate instead of getting in your belly. I prefer using the sit-in-vinegar-dumpling method to cool it down, then eating it whole. Allowing the juices to burst in my mouth. Immediately it was clear to me that the vinegar used in this restaurant sucks balls. The size of the dumplings also meant that cool down time was longer, taking away from the true enjoyment of perfect Xiao Long Baos. The saving grace of these dumplings (which they called buns in the menu btw, another peeve), was that the skin was acceptable. It was thin yet pliable, mostly able to carry the weight of the fillings. At a 2/16 broken dumpling ratio it was acceptable. I sucked it up and ate my food since I didn't want to be wasteful. Between the two of us we ordered 1 crab and pork, and 1 pork dumplings. There wasn't much difference other than the ghastly color of the crab and pork dumplings. Both tasted heavily of MSG and caused an unclean taste in the mouth and unnatural thirst. Maybe it became difficult to discern in the depths of my despair. Also this place is filthy the tea jug was gross. We were so unlucky to be sitting next to a girl who was so annoyingly peppy about being a foodie, and that this would be her last meal on earth. Her friends seemed unimpressed as she kept trying to hype them up about the dumplings. It was fun to watch. Girl you don't know shit LOL We paid and hustled out of there. Will not be back. 3 stars for good dumpling skin, which is really hard to master, but minus 1 for filthiness. Sorry to pop your dumpling bubble! Supposedly it's the best that New York's got. That's sad.
"First time posting - the rude manager inspired me to sign up. Don't be fooled by the 2x1 Gin and Tonics sign outside, it's 2x1 per person and cannot be shared - but they'll only tell you that rudely at the end of your meal. My gf and I were walking around the neighborhood when we saw the sign and were excited because 1) we love G+T's, especially of the Spanish variety, and 2) because of the great deal. The server even mentioned the 2x1 G+T deal when we sat down. When we asked for the bill, we were asked if we were having another drink, to which we said no because we had other plans we were getting to. That's when our server said the 2x1 special was per person. I asked if that was written anywhere, and she said no, that was just the policy. So, I asked if she wouldn't mind asking the manager if he could honor the deal since we came in with the expectation that it was a true 2x1 deal. She obliged and said she would ask. That's when the manager came by and asked what it was that we needed. It appears that the server did not explain to him the situation, but she sent him over - which itself was little weird. We explained the situation, and he said the same thing: 2x1 is per person. I then told him that the sign and the fact that the server re-emphasized the 2x1 deal when we sat down, without saying ""per person"" was misleading. We agreed to pay the bill and when he returned with the bill we suggested that they add 2x1 ""per person"" in their messaging, so they wouldn't be misleading and set the right expectations for future customers- to which the manager said ""Don't tell me what to do."" We had had a nice time up to then. We enjoyed our drinks, enjoyed the space. But I work in the hospitality industry, and I put a lot of value in how customers should be treated. I wasn't rude, and I wasn't trying to scheme and get a deal that doesn't exist. We legit walked in expecting the sign meant what it said, and it turned out to be a bait and switch tactic. The worse part though, was the rudeness of the manager.  We won't be returning, unfortunately. And we hope management will take a second look at how they treat their customers."
Nothing like mojitos and margaritas on the patio. Great vibe here! Be ready for long lines for food tho!
The wait can be pretty painful at times, but they text you when your table is ready.   There are many types of Ramen but the one I get is the Karaka-men spicy tonkotsu ramen with cha shui.  The broth is really great, although I still personally think Ichirans broth is much better.  The chashui is perfectly sliced with the right amount of fat.  The Shishito peppers are simply fried and deliciously paired with yuzu salt.  I say get that and the pork buns. The pork buns are so soft and simple with lettuce and a fat piece of pork and some sauce.  Those that want to compare this with Ichiran. The major difference today Dec 2016, Ippudo has an egg option while Ichiran still doesnt.  Ichiran and Ippudo noodles are similar if not the same.  Ichiran doesn't require tipping while ippudo does, but overall prices are cheaper at Ippudo. Portions are bigger and Kae Dama is cheaper at Ippudo.   I love how there is more variety at Ippudo.  Ichiran and Ippudo both has their good and bad, but at the end of the day I would be equally happy with either bowl of ramen.
Decor: 3/5 -Totally not what I was expecting. -Amber/orange lighting with three long benches Service: 2.5/5 -average service Food: 1.5/5 -The only roll that tasted remotely good was the salmon guacamole ($5).  -The Japanese fried chicken was seasoned and had some flavor. There was about eight to nine pieces. Eat them while they are piping hot. -The other rolls were okay and disappointing: Mexican Bomb ($5), Hamachi ($6), Dragon Roll ($10), Una ten ($7), Crab, Mango and avocado roll ($15) I'm glad I had a voucher. I would not pay full price for Momo Sushi Shack.  I had high expectations and Momo failed.
"Hands down my favorite Thai restaurant. I visited Up Thai with my family on a weekend trip to NYC and stumbled upon this place through Yelp. The decorations are amazing, the flavors in the ""typical"" dishes we chose were outstanding and unique, and the service is good. Our favorite dish was the fried rice pot under chef specials. The seasoning and flavors made the dish stand out compared to other fried rice dishes. I can't stop talking about this place!"
"Inconsistent - I've ordered the Breakfast Platter over 3 times and have gotten 3 different variations of what is advertised as ""smoked salmon."" 1. Slices of smoked salmon on the side (seems correct) 2. No smoked salmon at all 3. Today I have cooked salmon mixed in with my scrambled eggs I'm not sure if this is because I get delivery, but they need to make sure everyone handling food is on the same page. At $14 a platter, you should get a consistent dish every time."
Great ambiance for a nice evening out.  Had the chicken paliard, not disappointed .. not wowed but my colleague have the chicken and waffles and it was outrageously deliciously!  So it's more of a palate kinda place but a a load of fun for large groups.  Service excellent.  Decor reminded me of a huge bathroom or a subway station .. super cool
Restaurant Week Menu at Root & Bone is so over the top! We had deviled eggs, biscuits, chicken & waffles, watermelon, Mac & Cheese  AND banana pudding for desert! For $29!!!  Hubs did the restaurant week menu and I ordered the shrimp & grits off the regular menu. Deliciousness shared. Root & Bone has been in the neighborhood for awhile now and this place has not lost its mojo!
It's no wonder this place gets the award for one of the best cheat eats in New York. You can get a set (8) of their signature Shanghai soup dumplings (xiao long bao) for only $7.  Don't make the mistake and order your typical Cantonese dishes since this place is known for their Shanghainese and dim sum cuisine. Whether you choose crab or pork, you have to order a set of the xiao long bao if you come here. The other items on the menu aren't spectacular so the dumplings are really the star of the show. Pass on the Peking style noodles in minced pork - the noodles are mushy and the sauce tasted like hot and sour soup with ground pork.  The dumplings are still as good as I remember but I might try another place next time I'm in New York's Chinatown.
The food is fine but the service is RUDE! They have so much attitude and seem to delight in being obnoxious to customers. Also even when they're near empty and you have a reservation, they make you wait to be seated until your dinner companion arrives.
I always have such a great experience every time I come here. Everyone is friendly, the food is great, the service is excellent. I also LOVE that the owner of the restaurant genuinely cares about his customers: greeting everyone, walking around to see if everyone is satisfied, helping the staff when it's super busy. Authentic Italian chef as well (yes please).  Also really impressed with tiny details such as using paper straws for drinks.
This place is fantastic. There's always a wait, and they don't take reservations, but this place is so worth it. It's a little loud, and a little tight inside, but the food is always fresh and delicious, and the service is always very nice. Such a cute place for any time of day!
BBQ was mediocre. Burger was overpriced for what it was: meat on a cold bun. Overpriced drinks. I guess you're paying for the majestic views of the Gowanus Canal.
Great food, fast and friendly service. Food was excellent. Try the Down East for sure......
For a Friday evening, this place was empty. There was only one other table in the dining area. I had the oysters and didn't finish them because they had a very fishy taste to them and I could tell they weren't fresh. Normally I don't like to give bad reviews for business but after I left the establishment my stomach has started queasy....
This was a huge disappointment. A group of five of us came here from a day of rooftop day drinking because we saw it it had high accolades on yelp and was a reasonable walking distance away. The saving graces were our server Perry, the Bordeaux, and baked Camembert with fig jam.  However, the negatives are unfortunately glaring. I am normally very positive but this one was such a let down. The scallop carpaccio was very bitter, the foie gras lollipops cold, and worst of all the duck confit was bland and tasteless. My friend described the duck the best - cheaply blended and molded. We expressed our dissatisfaction with the duck confit to our waiter and urged him to try what we were tasting. He took the dish, presumably tried it, and came back saying it was prepared the way it was supposed to taste. Then, proceeded to return our half eaten dish to the table, which we left untouched. We found that extremely odd and unprofessional especially if he had tried it like he said. When the check arrived, that duck confit was still on it! We paid graciously and obliged to the automatic gratuity for parties of 5+ but left extremely disappointed. Our friends from the NYT will be writing our experience as well. With all the other wine bar options in the area, won't be back.
"Joju is definitely my go-to for Banh Mi sandwiches and Kimchi fries.  Nothing like it anywhere else in NYC.  I would opt to give this place 5 stars, but I did encounter a tiny roach in my green apple slush on my last visit.  I know Elmhurst has a roach problem, but I would appreciate if there wasn't a bug swimming in my drink---total turn off.  I'm still a fan of Joju though, it's just that I'm gonna take a break from ordering their drinks. I didn't want to complain since I was introducing a few friends who never had it before and didn't want to skew their impression of the place.  I ended up throwing my drink out in the end.  But since the sandwiches are reasonably priced and extremely good, I'm willing to overlook this,.   For sandwiches I would either opt for the bulgogi or lemongrass chicken banh mi.  Can't go wrong with the two.  I must admit, I favor the bulgogi because I prefer beef, but chicken is a good lighter alternative.  I really like how the pickled daikon carrot mix cuts off the ""fattiness""/saltiness of the bulgogi.  The bread is quite hefty and crisp, so when you bite into the sandwich there's that delightful iconic crunch.  It can be a bit messy with the crumbs, but man it's delicious.  Also, they do add cilantro to their sandwiches, so if you are not a fan of cilantro make sure to tell them to exclude it (I don't mind it though). The kimchi fries are phenomenal.  Best to eat when it's fresh but still pretty darn good when taking it out. I especially like to have the sunny side egg on top, cutting into that yolk and having it run all over the fries, adding extra eggy-goodness on top is the best!  The mixture of kimchi and that spicy mayo-like sauce is a wonderful combination with the cilantro and scallion mixture----introducing a variety of tastes and textures.  Just thinking of the creaminess of the fries mixed with the runny egg yolk, slight tang and spiciness of the kimchi topped with the freshness of the scallions and cilantro is making me drool...     This place needs to open more branches!  The place is small, so it usually gets crowded and it's hard to find seats."
Before, when I order the seafood noodle, it mainly would have squids, 3 shrimps and fish ball.  Today, it has change to slices of pork, ground pork, 2 shrimps, fish ball and no squid. Plus that soup is not the same. WTF! If they continue with this, this bowl should not call seafood noodle but should  name as mix noodle.
Came here on a Friday night after work, starving Marvin hungry. Loved the seating and decor. Ordered guacamole as our appetizer. Chips were so hard and slightly stale. So much fillers in the guac. Big chucks of tomatoes and onions in it and not enough avocado. I've had guacamole in many places before and this time around I was very unsatisfied. Ordered 2 sangrias, two skirt steak, one lamb, one shrimp, one chorizo taco and one tamale. The prices of the tacos were pretty expensive ($2.75-$4) and so tiny (refer to pics). Lamb was chewy which I didn't mind but it was dry. The taste of everything else was okay, nothing to rave about since it was so little I barely got the taste of it before it was finished.  18% tip....what?? Definitely not coming back here. We left still hungry after a $50 dinner. Le sigh..
I don't get it. The sauce was good. The square was bland, soggy, soupy, and the crust didn't have one bit of a crunch. We likened it to cafeteria pizza. Maybe it was just an off batch/day, but nothing to stand in their really inefficient pickup vs slice ca ice cream lines, even when you called in your order. For the amount of good reviews and general fanfare this place gets, we tried to give it another chance with their cheese pizza and it was dripping with oil and was in general just a meh slice. Nothing horrible but nothing amazing. Still can't find a comparable square to Prince Street Pizza.
Fried chicken? Yes please. Hot fried chicken? Yesssssssss. Definitely worth the trip out to BS. Make sure you order ahead for pick up so you can walk past the huge crowd of nervous foreign exchange students and parents from Ohio visiting their hipster kids. No wonder people hate gentrification.
Horrible service. Overpriced tapas. Weak drinks. Small portions. A place geared for non locals looking to take advantage of the JC hype. What a waste of JC space. I hope this place rots.
We dined early evening and within 15 minutes of being seated there was a queue for tables. This is a very popular place and it's easy to see why. We both had the green chicken curry and it was delicious. In fact, one of the best I've eaten outside Thailand. Service was attentive and polite and though we sat outside, it's clear that inside has been designed as an inviting environment. We'll be back!
Food, one word. Insanity. Staff, two words. Top notch. Steamed clams for appetizer, the broth is phenomenal, soak your bread in there. It's a meal by itself. Main was mint and lamb love letters (ravioli), tasty, the mint was a perfect touch to the rich lamb sauce. For dessert, saffron panna cotta. The texture was silky, creamy and smooth, very few places get it correct. Babbo has one of the best panna cotta I've tasted, its pure bliss. Bar staff, excellent service. They make you feel at home.
Really love the vibe in this cute place but I went on Saturday for the first time in a while and the service was terrible. Not only did they keep forgetting to bring things we had ordered (or not forget but just take ages) but one of the waitresses had a terrible attitude. She made us feel like we were an inconvenience. Food was good, nothing amazing. Overall disappointing.
5 star service.  Food is delicious.  Atmosphere is great, we had lunch on their patio.  Definitely recommend!
What an amazing experience!!!! Between being greeted when we walked in, to the food, drinks and dessert, this is a date night spot my husband and I will come to more frequently! We started with the spicy buffalo hot wings which were delicious! I had a margarita and my husband had the mojito.. lets just say after his second mojito he was feeling really really nice! We then both had the tacos for our main course which was cooked to perfection.... loved the flavors and the attention to detail! The restaurant owner's brother kept checking in on us which made us feel so special, he even recommended that we try the churros. Normally we never order dessert... but we decided to go all out! WOW!!!! The churros topped off the night. Thank you to The Alcove for providing such a wonderful experience! We will be back very soon!
Made a reservation for a party of 8 at 7pm. A few of us got here earlier and made the happy hour which ends at 7. The music by the bar was way too loud for us to have a conversation. We thought about going to a different restaurant but decided to stay since the music wasn't as loud in the dining area.  We ordered the truffle burger, salmon burger, pan roasted chicken and black sea bass with a pitcher of sangria. The truffle burger with roasted shiitake mushroom was delicious and the truffle fries on the side were really tasty. We all liked our food, but it might be because we waited for about 30 minutes for our food to come out- we were so hungry!! I would've liked to come back and try a different burger if the music wasn't so loud and the service was quicker.
Wanted to give it another try, wish I would not. Food is bad, service is bad as it was before. Total waist of time and money
The temperature was just right as we enter a gussy theater-district restaurant for an experience of a lifetime. Picture this: a group of 10 or so happy friends getting together to dine and celebrate our dear friends 30th birthday before a dueling piano show. A night to truly remember... ...well that it certainly was. but for all the wrong reasons.  We sit down and order drinks (consisting of 8 diet cokes and 4 or so mixed drinks -- pretty dry crowd). We wait around for a good 15 minutes before they come. Our waitress then asks us if we wanted to place our order (poor etiquette -- she had asked us about 7 times before that, but we weren't ready. We're a big group and haven't seen each other in a while, plus, girlfriend, our menus were STILL OPEN. Take a page out of the old book on SOCIAL CUES.) Finally we decide we're ready. We're going around the table placing our orders, all pretty standard -- nothing fancy. Someone ordered a chicken sandwich, all was well. Another ordered a roast chicken dish, and they were out of chicken. Sold out, through with perdue, done with chicken. Meanwhile, the waitress didn't have any lifelines left. She had already asked the audience, took away two answers, AND phoned a friend, and on top of that she never left the table. How did she know there was enough chicken for one dish but not the other? Never the twaine shall meet. What a giant foolish fool. She left the table by saying 'Your order will be right up'. We waited, and waited, and waited. We heard a few 'it'll be out in just a couple of minutes' and 'it'll be right outs', but the food just never came out. 2 hours later, and this is no exaggeration, 2 hours later, the food never came out. At this point we had already spoken to the manager twice: once inquiring about where the heck our food was, and the second for him to offer us a round of drinks that none of us took him up on as we waited and waited and waited. Tik tok on the clock and the party didn't start, even though we walked in.  We look over and there was a table behind us (also a really large party) who also hadn't received their food staggered in a way that some people received their food and some never even ate (must have been the chicken pandemic). One hadn't eaten, but her husband was already there to pick her up. No dinner for you, lady! Anyway, back at our table, we waited for the manager as he was dealing with the representative at the table next to us. Finally he comes to talk to us and we explain that we have to go to a show which was about to begin. He says... drum roll please... 'would you guys mind at least paying for the drinks'... our response... 'no'. He then says 'traditionally in a restaurant if you order food and it's cooked for you, you pay for it.' Our response, 'but we didn't see even a lick of food. nothing was prepared, and if it was, it was never brought to our table'. He says, 'well we did prepare some of it, it's just downstairs'. In the next breath he says, 'we'd really love to have you back for a complimentary meal on us'. We politely declined and rolled out, hungry AF. We ended up eating at a bodega around the corner, who was more accommodating than this mockery of a restaurant. Looking back it makes me giggle at how poorly run this restaurant is, but it made for some really funny memories.  For the yelp readers who want a true analysis: This place is a joke and not worth having dinner at. Terrible. This review is 100% truth. I also make music videos.
"Let me just start by saying that I have always been a huge fan of this restaurant and have dined here multiple times for special occasions. However, this past experience there will probably be my last. Readers, beware of the tall & skinny waiter who serves the very back room of the restaurant: he is extremely rude and disrespectful (he works a shift on Wednesday evenings).  My family came all the way from Asia this week for my graduation and I wanted to treat them out to a nice restaurant, so we came to Uncle Boons, which at that time I believed was one of the best Thai restaurants in the city. Everything went smoothly in the beginning, but the problem arose when our dishes arrived. One of our appetizers was the lamb salad with cucumber, but when my family and I tasted it, we all agreed that it was extremely sour, sour to the point where we would scrunch up our faces in reaction to the strong citrus taste. However, because we haven't tried the dish in the past, I called our waiter over to ask him about whether this extremely sour taste was inherent in the dish's original flavor. As I was speaking to him, he seemed very exasperated by me and it seemed like he was in a hurry to get me to stop talking. He responded to my question with a very impatient tone, telling me that the dish is supposed to be sour and spicy. He then proceeded to say demandingly, ""so do you want me to take it away or not"", with no regard for me or my family's confusion about the dish. This was a red flag for me, because he did not seem cheerful but rather annoyed and pissed off at me and my family for inquiring about the dish. But, I just brushed that off, assuming that he was just stressed about taking care of the other tables in his section.  But here's when the situation gets worse. The incident that really fucking pissed me off later that night was when he brought over our main entrees (the khao soi & massaman). We had an empty plate on the table as he was placing our new dishes, so I told him that he could take the empty dish, as the table was getting very crowded and it was evident that we would not have enough space for our sides. To this, he responded to me by muttering under his breath, ""good to know"", in an extremely sarcastic and honestly insulting manner. Having worked in the service industry myself in the past as a waitress, I was absolutely horrified by his shitty attitude, as my family and I had treated him with nothing other than kindness and respect. The kind of disrespect he showed me was unforgivable and I was extremely tempted to leave the restaurant then and there if it weren't for my family to calm me down. I demanded to speak to the manager, and informed him of the situation. Although he did apologize and promised to speak to our server about this, at that point there really was nothing that could be done. We were almost finished with our meal and I just couldn't wait to get out of there. Although we were taken care of by a different (and MUCH nicer and respectful) waitress for the rest of the night, I cannot say that I would ever go back to this place until I know for certain that I will never have to see this man's face again. I have recommended this restaurant countless times to my friends and family, but will no longer continue to do so."
"I do this with a heavy heart...but I am downgrading my review by one star due to the fact that they changed menu/jacked up prices. Obviously I haven't been there in about a year because I used to have the Taste of Maine ""combo"" which contained a half roll each of the lobster, crab and shrimp rolls, 2 jonah crab claws, chips and a soda for about $24-$25.  Now, they changed the menu to make it more ""a la carte"" and Taste of Maine is no longer available.  Bullcrap.  I feel that I am getting jipped.  You have to order everything separate and if I did that, lunch would be over $30.  Plus it seems like the rolls are getting smaller. I forgot to mention that this place, like all the other places in New York is small.  And no Wifi. But on the flip side...they still have the best tasting lobster/crab/shrimp rolls in New York.  My mouth waters just looking at the pictures but my wallet weeps."
This is a super cute restaurant with an open kitchen concept.  I came here with two girlfriends so the three of us shared: Dozen oysters: a good starter Rigatoni: the lobster pieces are very generous and the pasta is cooked well Branzino Icelandic Cod Smoked LI Duck: my favorite dish PB&J Make sure to enjoy your meal with some wine or cocktails. The food is good and service is fantastic. After dinner make sure you take advantage of the view of the bridges.
I ordered two chicken tacos and my sister tried the quesadilla. We didn't have to wait too long, even though it was fairly busy. You can choose between a corn and flour tortilla, so I tried one of each. I have to say I liked the flour one better. They have toppings that you can add onto your taco, but they're on the counter where people eat, so you have to awkwardly reach over people to get to them. The tacos themselves were enjoyable but not anything spectacular.
Disappointing. The staff were friendly. The food was okay. After going to the Butchers Bar in the city we had high expectations.  We ordered mac and cheese. I couldnt eat it. They mixed it with guac instead of the yummy bacon from the other location. We ordered pork belly, meat candy, and ribs. They were decent but did not even come close to how scrumptous the food was in the other location. Not coming back.
No vegetarian. Being in vegetarian friendly east village, I feel there should really be at least one option other than salad.
"So I saw a few pictures of the food from this place and thought hmmm looks yummy. Let's just say looks can be deceiving. The food was SO BLAND. My first star was taken off because you get there and have no clue what to do. Like no one to explain the process. Apparently you order and pay at the extremely crowded bar which takes forever. Given a number and look for a seat. At the bar we are told they have run out of pork belly, beans, and collard greens. So basically you are subjected to get coleslaw as a side which i am NOT a fan of. Surprisingly when my food came it was the only thing that had some type of taste. That was the first downfall. The food comes out in batches which sucks as well. I ordered the philly cheese chicken sandwich. I swear the sandwich had NO taste. I literally had to put salt and hot sauce . the Mac and cheese waffle .. NOT worth it. Like no taste at all as well. Had to drench it in the ""queso"" aka nacho cheese sauce they gave.  I gave two stars because the staff was sort of nice and the nap time sandwich my friend ordered was OK. That sweet potato waffle was so overly salted it was crazy. It was as if everything was bad. Never coming back again. Wasted my money at this place."
Came here for lunch / brunch on a Saturday and had a decent experience. They offer a bottomless brunch deal which is $25 for unlimited mamosas, some type of sangria and bloody marys. Don't love super sugary drinks, so I opted to just get a couple of beers while the other members of my party did the $25 deal.  As for the food - all four of us had pizzas. I tried the margarita and the the Amatriciana. Both were solid, but neither stood out as spectacular. Truffle fries we got to split were very good.  I really liked the spot itself. Didn't pack the tables in super close which is a nice change of pace from many NYC brunch spots. Also service was well above average. Never  had to track anyone down to get something.  Overall, I don't know if I'll be back for brunch, but looking at these reviews there's absolutely a happy hour deal I want to check out.
This place was terrible. I ordered the shiu mai, chicken feet, pork bun, sesame seed balls, stuffed eggplants, and spare ribs. I'm pretty sure the chicken feet were microwaved because some parts was super hot and others were cold. The pork bun was really a miss for me, though I suppose I could see how others would enjoy it. Overall, a huge miss. Maybe on a good day I would've given it a 2/5, but just not today. Go to Jing Fong or Golden Unicorn and you'll have a much better experience.
It was just ok... Veal parm... Ive had better and the sea bass was to wet could of been cooked a bit longer.... To much $$$ for what it was..
Wayyyyyy overpriced for the quality of the food. Don't get me wrong, the ribeye is delicious, but is it worth $250? I would say not. It is a huge portion though so maybe it would be worth it if we had more than 3 people. It was too much food for 3 girls. If it was more affordable I would give it 4 stars primarily for the ribeye alone.  The ribeye was cooked perfectly. It was really tender and flavorful, but there were also a lot of fatty parts that all of us girls didn't care for.  The ribeye came with a side of Caesar salad and fries. I was pretty disappointed by the sides. For $250 I thought we would get something worth our money. Even roasted vegetables would've been better than fries and a salad. The salad was also ridiculously big. We barely made a dent in it. The fries were just regular average fries. Nothing special.  We also had the duck dumplings as an appetizer and they were just okay. I wasn't impressed.  The worst part was our waiter was really pretentious. He had a terrible attitude and wasn't a very pleasant waiter.  I would say it's worth trying. I just wish the ribeye wasn't so expensive. They could offer it for smaller portions at a lower price. I would recommend getting stuff off the a la carte menu instead of doing the pre-fixe menu. Or I've heard the rotisserie duck is better than the ribeye.
Made reservations for 8:30 Friday night. When we arrived early we had a short wait then were seated. Place is a little overwhelming on the noise front - they need some type of sound reduction.  Our waiter quickly came over and had already been to happy hour so my friend and I decided to split the burrada and the Apple/squash salad. Both were AMAZING - if I'd had more room we definitely would have overeaten on bigger plates. With still a little room left, we tried the pumpkin bread pudding for dessert. Such a seasonal, delicious dish! It had cranberries on top and cinnamon ice cream - made me wish I could make this at home for Thanksgiving, it was perfect. Next time I'm in the City I'd definitely come back for a full blown meal!
We had a great experience with our waiter. He was kind and attentive without being intrusive. We thought that the food was way too expensive for what we received. $32 dollars for half a fillet of fish or $18 for a few bites of fideuá, a noodle paella which was a great tasting dish but served in such a small portion that it made sharing awkward. Of the dishes we had the fideuá was the standout.  A number of the other dishes were just okay. There was even a salt baked fish for which, ironically enough, we had to request salt because it was underseasoned. I like the fun ideas of the restaurant's menu . It's just that the portions, instead of making you focus on the meal you've had, just make you feel cheated. Not the best feeling to have after a meal. Just made us long for Curate.
"So I live up the block from Butcher Bar and they've been on my ""to eat"" list for quite some time now. As far as stars go I'm between 4 and 4.5 - but I'm not ready to bump it up to 5 until I go back and check out their ""Meat Candy"" Beef Burnt Ends and their ""Butcher Bowl"" (mashed potatoes, fresh corn & jack cheese topped w/your choice of Smoked Pork or BBQ Chicken.) Last Saturday I came here for dinner with my fiancé after a fun filled day in Brooklyn. We were planning on going to one of my favorite Italian food restaurants but the MTA had different plans for us so we decided to go here. He had been here for cocktails and I had been here...never - although I truly, truly, truly regret not checking them out back when they were BYOB - (RIP because now they sell booze themselves). As my entree I ordered their Half Baked Mac & Cheese off of their appetizer menu. They describe it as being their famous creamy mac & cheese, oven baked in a cast iron skillet topped w/ grass fed beef chili, bacon bits  & jack cheese. I asked for the chili on the side because I worried that if it was too spicy then it would ruin the meal for me. The waiter asked me if we were sharing it and I responded back that I was gonna treat this cheesy sucker as my main meal. He was concerned that I wouldn't be able finish it all on my own. He also stressed that this was a serving for two and that I would not be able to handle it all on my own...yeahhhh...he clearly doesn't know me, lol. I stood firm in my order. My sweetheart ordered their Smoked Ribs. There are two options here - House Dry Rubbed and Fall Off The Bone Sauced and he opted for the latter. On BB's menu they are described as being ""smoked til they fall off the bone"" and ""sauced just right"". He gave me a rib and I've gotta say, IT TOTALLY FELL OFF THE BONE aaaaaaand WAS SAUCED JUST RIGHT!! Lol. These ribs are easily in the top 3 ribs I've ever had at a restaurant. Yes, they were that good. My mac and cheese was delightfully creamy and I'm happy to report that while the beef chili had a little bit of kick, it was totally fine for me! Trust, my tolerance for spicy anything isn't great and their chili was super flavorful and generously meaty. The mac also came with crispy bacon bits (of kind of thick cut bacon...sooooooo not complaining here!) and was really good without being overpowering.  We also shared sides of mashed potatoes and their french fries (go hard or go home, amirite?). The mashed potatoes were really delicious and made chunky with the skins on - just the way I like em'. The fries were unbearably salty for me. I could barely get through 4 or 5 before throwing in the french fry towel. I did like that they were clearly hand cut, with the skin on and rather thick. Just a little less salt tossed in next time would make me a happier camper. Both my fiancé and I really enjoyed our meal here. Even though it was like a 20 minute wait  to get a table - it was a Saturday around 7ish - so totally understandable. Everyone was great from the hostess, to the bartender, to our really attentive and personable waiter. Great service, great food and located in a fantastic location. Anyone giving Butcher Bar 2 stars and a place like Dallas BBQs 4 needs a palette readjustment because it's like comparing Morton's Steakhouse to Burger King (*sips her tea* just my opinion, lol). I love you Butcher Bar and I can't wait to be back! :)"
Guess I'm the dissenting opinion here on Yelp...don't think I'm as big of a fan of this place as most people are... The food itself is not bad, but in my opinion overpriced relative to its competitors and the serving size is way small. Honestly, I'd call the regular more like a snack size. I was still hungry after eating my bowl, which has never happened to me when dining at any of the other poké spots around town. I got the goma shoyu tuna, regular size. After tip and tax, it was more than $17 - for such a tiny bowl! You are paying 30% more for less food when compared to other places around town like Pokéworks, Sons of Thunder,  PokéSpot, etc. Granted, Chikarashi's bowl does seem to have a bit more care in assembling it and more ingredients, but I feel it just doesn't justify the cost. After eating my meal here I headed straight to a dumpling house to fill up the rest of my stomach. The setup here is more similar to Sons of Thunder in that the bowls are pre-set and not customizable like Chipotle/Pokéworks. Probably won't come back here unless the prices come down about $2-3 per bowl or the sizes get bigger. For now, Sons of Thunder is still my favorite fast-casual poké spot in NYC
It's interesting that Yelp seams to be less accurate in big cities than it is elsewhere. Brazen averages 4 stars in NYC but I can confidently say after one dinner that it's not.  2 stars--3 if you want to be generous. They just aren't really trying with the food here. I had a lobster roll and it was a pitifully small amount of lobster on a salty roll. Not good and not good value either. Soggy fries on the side. I give credit where it's due but I think this place is due for a chef change. Too bad too cause it has a good comfortable vibe and it should be better.
The restaurant was really nice and sort of reminded me of Miami at the entrance. We had the pleasure of sitting outside where we had a beautiful view of the bridge and water. My only complaint was the service. When they sat us they took approx 15 minutes to even get our drink order. Then it took about an hour to even get our entree. After making a complaint the manager was nice enough to comp us the entree. The risotto was delicious along with the branzino! I wasn't so crazy about the meatballs but everything else was delicious.
A group of us are driving in New York to a wedding. My friend was almost-drooling as she talked about how amazing Cafe Habana is. I think she talked about Cafe Habana for 20 minutes straight. I thought to myself - I have to try this place! This was 3 years ago.  Since then, I have been to Cafe Habana countless times for lunch, dinners, or stop by just to eat their delicious Mexican corn. Cafe Habana is known for their Cuban sandwiches, and grilled Mexican corn. Their Cuban sandwiches are juicy savory slices of roasted pork, stuffed with ham and swiss cheese. It is heavenly. The grilled corn is blackened sweet corn-on-the-cob rolled in mayo, cotija cheese and sprinkled with chili powder and lime. Their caipirinhas are strong.  This is one of the best places to have a dinner in the Soho area. Be prepared to wait for the diner portion.
Who knew burger & lobsters go well together.  The burger bites is a must get. I got the Fiesta lobster roll, it was alright. I still prefer Luke's lobster roll If you have a big appetite, I would suggest you to order the BEAST. it's a burger with lobster meat in it.
I enjoy this place a lot. the decor is very fancy and has very good food. I usually stop by if I am in the area and want Thai/Viet food. the prices aren't too bad and the service is usually pretty good. I've had the pad thai, curry, and buc luc lac before - all were very good. given the location, this place can get pretty crowded, especially since the decor is pretty nice and a lot of people come here for dates. I would definitely recommend if you are in the area and I will be back as well!
We had an unpleasant experience last night.  First of all, I made a reservation online on Monday for Friday night, however they told me my reservation was canceled when I called them on Friday before we headed over; I did not get any explanation how or why my reservation got canceled....but they managed to eventually get us a table after we arrived. Second, the food was subpar and the service was terrible; it took forever for someone to take our order, and the waiter never checked back after delivering the food.  We wanted to order more food and drinks and literally never had the opportunity to do so.  Overall a very bad experience and I don't think we will be back.
Writing this now, the day after I came here, while on lunch break and eating a sad salad. I miss Adrienne's. I am not a pizza lover or picky by any means, and I usually just find pizza pretty good! But WOW this pizza is simply to die for.  A group of us came around 7 pm and were seated quickly (although I had to wait, since everyone has to be present to get seated). Service was prompt, and even though the pizza is housemate, also came out relatively quickly. Not a huge fan of the table bread, but the pizza steals the show!  Four of us shared a large white pizza, which turned out to be just enough and was only $8 per person! I also took a margarita pizza to go, which I also greatly enjoyed as the crust was so crispy and the flavors perfect. My white pizza crazy friends always crave the white pizza here, and while I appreciate the hefty cheese I always feel a little guilty coming here. But seriously, I get the pizza craze now. Would come again--and I hate going to places twice that are out of my way!
Soy milk and You Tiao, chinese fried dough is the best combo for breakfast. It's one of the most traditional Chinese breakfast. I am also a big fan of chives pancake. Chive is a green vegetable with a special aroma. Since I don't eat red meat anymore, I don't order Xiao long bao anymore. I like to order the cold dishes, cucumber and seaweed, very refreshing. The price can't be more decent.
"Came in from Connecticut and we wanted Thai.  A quick Yelp search revealed Up Thai to be the highest rated Thai restaurants in the area, close to where we were staying.  Arrived a little after 6pm on a Friday night to find the place already busy, but just in time to grab seats.  I have nothing but praise for this establishment.   SERVICE: They know how to get you seated, served, and satisfied - all staff pitches in to create an aware, thoughtful and attentive team, working with the pace established by the diner. SPACE: beautifully decorated, inviting atmosphere - even with a packed house, we could hear each other from across the table.  Had to share our table with others, but it was large enough to accommodate us all without creating an awkward ""too close"" situation. FOOD: absolutely the best Thai we've EVER had.  I had a mango/avocado salad with a unique spicy tamarind dressing - it was perfectly fresh, ripe and GONE.  For dinner - Chicken Pad Thai (not very adventurous, but I felt a safe first order) and it was PERFECT; really fresh, great portion (enough for leftovers).  Husband had the soft-shell crab salad, followed by the Shrimp Pad Se-ew.  He loved it and we both wished we lived closer so we come back more often. This team is working hard to put out fresh, consistently great food.  When we do come back, we're coming here."
Was looking forward to trying this place out. A bit crowded and loud, but willing to deal. Table was sticky, but things happen. Ordered the charred eggplant - found it hard to finish because it was so tart from way too much vinegar. It was great when I found a section without so much vinegar. After about a 40 minute wait, finally got the rest of our food: the squid with squash and the hangar steak. When ordering, I asked if the squid was the body or legs and was told it was the body. Well, it was mostly legs. And again, this vinegar sauce that was so strong I had a hard time eating anything on the plate. I couldn't even finish the squash since it was almost inedible - like it had soaked in vinegar for months. The hanger steak looked like someone had already eaten half of it. Only two small slices in a big pool of - you guessed it - vinegar. We were beginning to think it was a joke. Conclusion: Very expensive meal that is almost impossible to eat. My throat is still burning. Never again.
The service is beyond fantastic. Every single employee here is very helpful and polite. I have absolutely nothing against the service, the atmosphere, and the food decoration.  Although the food is good, it isn't among the most fantastic dishes I've had in NYC. There's no spices or sauces that stand out. The service and the atmosphere would be an absolute 5/5, but the food has to be 4/5.
2 stars just for the delirium beer! We were sitting here for 20 minutes without menus. I don't usually complain since I work in this industry myself and hate pointless complaints. Don't eat here. My friends ordered grilled shrimp entree and it was not even grilled first of all, the chorizo and mushroom and red sauce makes such a bad combination for that dish that we had to return it and ordered seafood combo instead which was even worst cause all the calamari is frozen and has no flavor ($27) we had a bit cause we were starving , I had a burger and ordered it med-rare with Swiss and it came well done with cheddar. We didn't touch the combo and just decided to leave. No hospitality here. No good food here. Bye now.
Reservations for 4, dinner on a weekday.  We were seated immediately upon arrival and service throughout was prompt and good. We ordered a. Lot. Of. Food. And some sake Overall, not bad food quality, efficient service. I'd recommend the dons and meats. (Orders of skin were tooooo oily!) also, unfortunately, we were seated right below air vents so the toasty food became cold very quickly and with yakitori..... that's never great, especially if you're ingested innards and appetizers like eggplant with mochi in a sticky broth.  I'd be trying out other yakitori places before returning because we weren't blown away.
Heard such great thins about it. Went with 5 other friends before we went to Brooklyn bowl and we're all left hungry and disappointed. The joint was dead and we waited 10 minutes to be seated, literally. No one acknowledged us. It was our first time there so we had no idea on the system. I order two Moscow mules from the special and they were horrible. It was straight up vodka and ginger ale. So I returned it and got a beers. Food didn't taste fresh and something was off.  Could be the places was having an off day. Been  contemplating on giving it a second chance...
"On rainy day, my friends and I were really hungry and drenched so we quickly decided this place last minute. We were excited because we saw reviews and photos of some of the dishes on yelp (unagi don and tuna tataki). But the meal has left me thinking if it was actually good or if I was just really hungry. Nonetheless, there were some things I did like and enjoy from this experience. It was just that the dishes seemed like a hit and miss thing.  I really like the ambience of Benemon, cozy and small for rather intimate talks and chats with a few friends. It didn't get too loud (like some places along with their music) so it didn't bother or interrupt our conversations.  My friends and I decided to get a range of things from appetizers to main dishes. From the ""From the Farm"" part of the menu, we got the Salty Pork Belly ($8) and Kara-age Fried Chicken ($8). We also got the tuna tataki ($12) from the ""From the sea"" part of the menu. We decided that we were going to share the unagi don ($26) and curry pork donkatsu ($15). The tuna tataki came first and we were amazed, nothing special and it wouldn't taste like anything if there wasn't any of the spicy sauce. The salty pork belly came around the same time and it was a surprise! The pork belly fat was crispy-crunchy, giving the overall bite an amazing extra layer of taste. The sauce that came along with it complimented the meat really well, I would definitely order this again next time if I come back next time. The Kara-age Fried Chicken was super crispy on the outside and the chicken meat was extremely juicy, just as it was described on the menu.  The unagi don came with huge pieces of unagi over white rice and had seaweed strips on the side. The unagi was good and all but it was not worth $26 in my opinion. It's something I could've made myself at home and there wasn't even that much rice. The pork curry donkatsu was alright, the first piece of chicken I had was extremely dry, but the second one I had was a bit juicier. I've had better curry before so it didn't stand out to me. Plus it was extremely salty.  The staff was extremely polite and attentive."
When you get a sudden craving for bahn mi and you're in the queens area, I was advised to try JoJu, known for their Korean/Viet fusion sandwiches and fries. First time ordering here, I didn't recognize the classic bahn mi as the traditional form of BBQ pork bits so I played it safe and ordered the lemon grass chicken instead. The wait was about 10-15 mins, understanding these are made fresh per order. Overall, I think they have great quality ingredients but flavors are lacking. Even the pickled carrots can be more pickled.
"This is my favorite restaurant in NYC! There is just this ease about eating here. The prices are fair, the food is delicious and the portions are generous. The biscuits, chicken biscuits, fried chicken boxes and the side dishes (especially the grits, hush puppies, collard greens, sausage gravy) are all winners.  The Lumberjack (2 eggs, pancakes, home fries & bacon/sausage) is better than expected. Pricier than a diner breakfast, but just as good. Pies n Thighs is reliable for take out as well. My only gripe is that the service can sometimes be a ""slight"" let down. Regardless this place is invaluable."
I came here last night after seeing all the good reviews, craving tapas, and wanting to find a place nearby in Brooklyn. Well, it must have been a bad night because I was sadly disappointed. We had a table by the kitchen opening and could see the food being spooned out of plastic takeout containers by less than enthusiastic kitchen staff. Maybe because it was a monday night and was slow? But thats not much of an excuse...  No complaints on the service which was fast and attentive.  The food however:  - We started with the sardines, deviled eggs, olives, and sausage spread. Sardines were way too salty but not bad. Deviled eggs (or rather 1 egg) were nothing special. Olives are olives and hard to screw up. The spread was kinda gross with an overly gooey texture.  - We thought to try to special of suckling pig. We heard good things about crispy skins etc. At $30 for 1 plate, we were expecting something great but eeekk! The skin was rubbery and overly salty is some places, the meat was overcooked and hard in others, and there was a fowl aftertaste that lingered for a long time after I finished. For $30 a plate (and a portion enough for 1 person)? Really? - Ended the night with olive oil ice cream (which I was very much looking forward too because I've had it elsewhere and loved it).  But even that was obviously kept in the freezer for too long and a little too liberally doused in sea salt. The taste was more vanilla than olive oil.  Well that was our night. Had the prices been a bit lower, I might have gone a bit easier on it. But the prices they charge command better quality. Again, maybe it was a bad night but I think I'd rather just venture out into the city for a better tapas place next time.
I was very excited to finally visit Jack's Wife Freda after hearing so many things about it and seeing so many people post trendy pictures of it on Instagram. It's a little hyped, but definitely worth going once! The place in itself was exactly what I expected. It looks like it does in photographs: modern, colorful, open, airy, causal, trendy, friendly, a bit hipster. The line was as long as I anticipated as well. 12:00pm on a lovely Saturday = 2hr wait. Luckily, we put our name on the list and walked around, came back after 45min and the waitress let us sit as many other people didn't show up. Score! They don't take reservations for groups under 6 people. The service was very friendly. Our waiter was a tall slender man with an accent, very nice guy! We immediately ordered and I'd say the food came in about 20min. Perfect. It was a little loud, but I could still hold a conversation with my friend, so we didn't mind at all. I ordered the Mediterranean Breakfast (hold the pita and labne as I am currently on the Whole30 - the place is very Paleo friendly) with Cantaloupe Juice. The eggs were perfectly poached, the chopped salad was perfectly portioned with added mint and they gave me about 1/4 a perfectly ripe avocado. My friend got the Green Shakshuka with Watermelon Juice and we split their House Cured Duck Bacon. The saltiness of the bacon definitely added a good contrast flavor to my plate. Orders came exactly the way we asked for them and their juices are 100% pure fruit - no sugar added! They were refreshing, I liked the Cantaloupe more than the Watermelon. The food was delicious, nothing spectacular, but good nonetheless. The bacon tasted, well, like ordinary bacon if you ask me. The experience was delightful. If the lines weren't so long, I would probably come more often, but it is what it is! Overall, I would recommend for anyone who wants a healthy, trendy option for brunch (as we all know brunch can be a little heavy). Enjoy!
I had the rigatoni with salmon. The pasta tasted like rubber and I left most of it. The salmon was overcooked as well. Service was very slow. Doesn't deserve the rating it has, in my opinion.
Great disappointment!!! I had a birthday party in this restaurant few weeks ago. My husband chose this place because there are separate rooms downstairs. He invited many friends and he hoped that everybody will enjoy. Unfortunately, it wasn't the case :( First of all, the service was terrible, actually, there was no service at all! All our guest were sitting at the two small tables and nobody came even with menus. We had to ask many times for menu, then for forks and knifes. We didn't have enough chairs and tables and we asked for those many times with no result for many hours. Everybody had to go to the bar to order drinks and our guests complained that bartender wasn't nice. Then food... Most people ordered hamburger or steak and nobody liked it. I ordered steak medium and I had to admit that at least it was really medium but... but it was too salty! I could not eat it! I tried to take out the sauce from the steak but it didn't help :( I thought that maybe it was me since I don't use too much salt but all other people said the same thing. One of my friend even returned it because she said that her steak was well done when she ordered medium and also it was too salty. All my guests were disappointed with the service and food. I was very sad that my birthday party was just a huge disappointment.... The only good thing was a music. I also would like to add that there are Happy Hours until 7 pm that includes half price for bottle of wine but...only on Mondays and Sundays. My party was on Wednesday when Happy Hours are for wine but by glass and only for one type (the worst one) of wine.
This place is amazing. It was my first time having chicken and waffles and they did not disappoint at all. Had I known I was getting nearly half a chicken I would have split it with my friend. It was okay because I took the leftovers to the hotel and had an after dinner meal later in the day. The place was filled with funny and very friendly people from the neighborhood and those that worked there as well. Coming from a Southern girl the fried chicken can hold a candle to several places in Mississippi. Great service and great food. Cheers!
"So I guess my first review on this place was ""flagged"". One of the worst dining experiences I ever had. Upper West Side? Dining here felt more like I was at some military base overseas.  I finally found time with my husband and my children to try this place out. Having been to Jacobs Pickles plenty of times in the past and truly have enjoyed our selves we were definitely happy about visiting their sister restaurant Maison Pickle. We knew the place gets packed most nights and there is a wait so considering we had children with us we went a little before the rush and we were seated right away. Thats where the problem happened. The hostess sat us at a table in the main dining area right across from the open kitchen, great, how nice was our first impression. right? Wrong. Barely 5 minutes went by and we hear loud yelling coming from the kitchen probably. Even with the room not full our first reaction was to think that some kind of fight or argument occurred. To our surprise we see the chef (We assumed he was the head chef because of his white coat) he was screaming yelling and cursing towards the rest of his staff like I had never seen before. The language he used was so disgusting I wouldn't  even want to mention the words that came out of his mouth. He had no regard for anyone especially my kids who in fear were looking over at us as they felt ashamed. My husband was so furious he wanted to confront him but due to the fact that we where there with our kids we didn't want to create a seen and just decided to leave.  To her credit a lady that again I would assume was the manager actually went over to him and pleaded him to stop yelling and to our next amazement his response to her was ""I dont care if anyone hears me""  and she just gave up trying.  Im sorry but never again will I support a restaurant with this policy and beware to people that are thinking of giving this place a try, if this is how they treat staff in front of house I cant start to imagine how they are treated when no one is around. As the ""Chef"" said I dont care I say the same thing why should we. They clearly dont. I wish I could have wrote a review about the food but sadly we lost our appetite that night. unless you enjoy your dinner with yelling and cursing there are plenty of other restaurants in the neighborhood to try."
My gut gives this place a solid 3.5, and I'll round up for the friendly and attentive service (and the bread).  To set the framework for the night, I came here with a $75 Groupon that included 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts. For additional good measure, I ended up there early and checked in on yelp to happily discover your yelp check in gets you a free glass of sangria! Shortly after being seated, we were greeted by a box of some highly addictive warm bread balls that I assume are filled with lots of butter, cheese, me accompanied with a black bean spread. It's awesome, and you will end up asking for a second box.  Bread aside, the rest of the meal... Red snapper ceviche - for a ceviche, the is an insanely large portion, though a lot of that is the papaya. This has more of a sweet tropical feel than one of a spicy, acidic ceviche. It's good, but I would likely try a different one next time.  Grilled Octopus - masterfully tender octopus, but probably the only small portion of the night.  Short Ribs - two really big hunks of short ribs, which were a little bit on the dry side, which is surprising considering how forgiving of a meat short ribs are. The tart with mushrooms, lobster, spinach, and onions were super flavorful, but the tart itself was a bit hard and did not want to be cut easily. The portion is big enough to expect leftovers.  Skirt Streak Special - this was a special for the night, served with a red chimichurri sauce. The wife enjoyed it, but the steak could have been a bit more tender.  Flan - solid rendition of the classic.  Tres Leches Cake - this was a towering piled of sweet soaked sponge cake. The cake itself is delicious, but does have some pineapple layered in there, which slightly overpowered the cake. Still really good though.  Almost all items (Octopus aside), the portions were really, really large. Between the large portions and the bread, I can't imagine it's possible to leave here hungry. In general, the dishes were good, but not exceptional. Service was friendly and attentive, and drinks were good.  Do I plan on coming back? Not at full price, no, but if I can snag another Groupon, perhaps.
Everything was great until it came under new management. Now the prices went up, and I just placed a $40 order and no green sauce.  As per the manager, you do not get any green sauce unless you pay $1.00 per 4 tbsp cup. Ridiculous!
Scallion pancakes and soup dumplings ... enough said! They are definitely worth getting, in fact, those are what I come to this place for anyway. This place is very popular for their soup dumplings, but I am sure they make other dishes too.  For the soup dumplings, I would recommend the crab meat with pork (only $6). Obviously, its juicy and hot, so don't eat it whole. The scallion pancake is thin and crispy on the outside but chewy once you start eating it. Cucumber with garlic is a pretty refreshing dish as well.  The service is fast, especially with the dumplings. The place is all cash, ​unfortunately. But again, its Chinatown so cash money all day eerday!
Craving fried chicken so badly at night so our group decided to try one of the most renown places in Williamsburg - pie and thigh, hoping it could impress us, it did! Didn't really order anything special, but only the fried chicken box. Omg, so amazing, the chicken skin was cooked so crispy and once you bite that piece out, you could see the white meat tucked in the middle, tender and a bit greasy. Chicken wing was always the best part, as you could feel the chunky skin slowly melt down in your mouth! Everything was fantastic to the least! This place was so tiny, with only about five tables. Make sure stop by slightly before dinner time to avoid the long wait. Definitely the best fried chicken so far, or one of.
Shortly said, I didn't feel their food was authentic Indian. My husband and I finally decided to give this restaurant a try today after passing by numerous times in the past. The atmosphere of the venue was nice, and the servers were attentive and nice. I wanted to give this place higher rate, but the food lacked the flavor and the kick we expected. This was a big turn off, sadly. (We ordered chicken korma and chana masala. Both were quite mild, more runny than we expected, and lacked spices.)  We used to live in Delhi for a few years and ate at local restaurants and shared homemade food with local colleagues, so I think we should know what actual Indian food is. I felt this place's lacked the flavor we were used to there.  This place gets good rate on Yelp, but, unfortunately, I cannot agree that. After leaving this place, our stomachs were filled, but I felt I need a spice fix in Jackson heights.   I'm not going to come back here.
This is hardly a restaurant, so if that's what you're looking for skip it.  There are like 5 things on the menu.  The pulled pork sandwich was pretty good and the wings were really good, but no biscuits or cornbread which I consider BBQ staples.  The waitress/bartender was also a huge bitchass.
We live in the neighborhood and managed to finally sneak in tonight and we were  so excited that we made the time to come. From the moment we walked in we were greeted, asked to have a seat to wait for a spot to open up and then were quickly given a menu and were asked if we wanted something to drink while we waited.  After waiting for only about 10 minutes we were seated at the bar area and the rest of the evening and experience was such a treat. Not only was everything we ordered fantastic but the owner/chef was kind enough to explain all of the dishes and guide us in the right direction. Watching him and his team prepare each meal to order was incredible. They all worked so well together and were very efficient, clean, kind, etc. We had the U & I, and the Sammy to start - SO good. Then we had the spicy miso noodles and the traditional noodles and they were also both delicious. Overall, the food, ambiance, staff, and experience was some of the best I've seen. We loved it and will return!
Pros: - Kuu chili ramen was good. Cons: - Tight seating. - Not consistent on quality of meat and how it is prepared. Tip: We opted for chicken instead of pork in the ramen.
Does your friend work in Jersey City, Wall Street, or Midtown?  Do you work in Staten Island?  Do you need a grungy dive bar to meet every month to tie on a serious buzz for less than $20 bucks? This is your place.   The bar is long.  It's dark.  People who play songs on the jukebox have horrible taste in music (U2, Bon Jovi).  I've never seen more than four women in this bar at one time.  I've never been upstairs.  A jackass movie advertisement has been in the bathroom forever. It's the type of place you would go to if you lost your job earlier that day.  I love it.  Great place for two old friends with no standards to meet up for some power drinks and power conversation.
"Amazing pizza!! Get black olives, pepperoni, and mushrooms, and you won't regret it!  It's the thinner style pizza, and comes in a baking tray (about 18"" x 12""), so it's obviously made for sharing (or for taking half of it home to eat later).  Also, the ambiance is so cute - you feel like you're in Europe as you're sitting outside on the tables that are set up on the cobblestone street. Love it!!"
I came to Momosan Sunday night with two friends. There was a decent wait for a table even on Sunday night! You have to be seated at the bar by the hostess also but there was no wait for us so we opted for that. The bar stools don't move, they're anchored to the ground.  I didn't know until we got here that this was Morimoto! I felt instantly cooler by a few points. We shared the gyoza and pork buns. Both were good I can't pick a favorite.. but ok fine maybe the gyoza. It comes out in a little cast iron dish and they add water and some toppings right before serving it to you so it the little dumplings have that brown crispy part (best part)!!  I had the Tokyo Ramen. The chicken was fresh and good. I thought the portions were right for the price. The presentation was awesome I was/am in awe of the seaweed with the printed momosan. So cute I loved it. Good service, awesome ramen!!! I want to come back ASAP
A place full of energy that offers amazing Thai food. Everything I tried was exceptional in taste and presentation.  The wait is usually long so make sure you sign up early for a table.
"Their food is great, but echoing what another customer said about the takeout process, it's become more of a hassle to do takeout with them then to just eat food from somewhere else. I've had my card rejected multiple times because of issues with the credit card system and just recently, I called in a takeout order and was asked if I could ""wait a minute."" That minute turned in to 5, with no one on the other end taking my order. I then hung up, called back, got the same person who then asked me if I could wait a few more minutes to place my order. I declined and said I would find my dinner somewhere else. It's unfortunate because their food is excellent, but as the other customer said, they've lost another loyal and paying customer."
First time having soba despite my obsession with Asian food. Soba is definitely an interesting flavor and like a lighter version of ramen. The flavor seems concentrated with a dark soy sauce or something. I thought the noodles were very well made and delicious. That's what you expect when they make it fresh! I got the fried chicken and garlic cold soba noodles $16. It comes with a hot dipping sauce with the fried chicken already in there. I love love love green onions and garlic, but they put a little too much in the dipping sauce and it was a bit overpowering. The overall flavor was just a little off to me.
Came here for a quick bite on a Wednesday night. When I first walked inside I was a bit confused because no one approached me but, just walk towards the middle of the restaurant where the register is and there you can ask for a table or order take out. The space inside is a bit tight and can definitely feel cramped for larger parties.  There was about a 25-30mins wait for a table but, rather than eat inside we chose to order for take out (about a 15 minute wait) and to eat al fresco at a park with benches just one block east from the restaurant.  We all ordered the chicken biscuit ($7.50), a fried chicken cutlet sandwiched in a biscuit topped with a honey butter and hot sauce. We didn't expect much getting food from here but, after the first bite we all looked at each other with wide eyes and I knew instantly that this was the highlight of our day. The honey butter sauce was very tasty, it was divine. I could barely taste any of the hot sauce but, hot sauce packets are provided if you feel the need to add more. Initially I thought one sandwich wouldn't be enough but it turned out to be enough for one person. This was one of the tastiest chicken sandwiches that I've ever had and for any future visits I don't know if I could dare try anything else on the menu. This Is a sandwich that I wouldn't mind trekking for especially if I'm anywhere near the Manhattan side of the Williamsburg Bridge, since the restaurant is located right on the other side of it.  If you're thinking about it, don't. There are few things in NYC that you could buy that are this tasty at this price point ($7.50) and my only regret was not asking for more honey butter sauce to smother my sandwich in.
"My old standby, let us down... Bit into the shanghai spring roll and it was ice cold, while the outside was hot. Suspect it was frozen and not cooked properly. One bite was enough. Soup dumplings, while usually great, were lukewarm, skins were tough. After eating the apps, someone started to clear the table. Huh? Oh--the waiter forgot to put in the rest of our order. The jumbo shrimp with ginger and scallions is still a standout--more than ample serving and tasty. But the shredded beef with garlic sauce was cooked sloppily with the thin slices of beef clumped together in large balls, probably coated with cornstarch(?) then thrown into a wok and not stir fried and separated. Disappointed, to say the least... and let's not comment on the ""B"" cleanliness rating or the disgusting condition of the bathroom--oh, I just did."
A superb restaurant with wonderful ambiance and impeccable service. We began with a Negroni Invecchiato Cocktail $18 (plymouth, tangerine-infused campari & carpano antica) - the most amazing balance I've ever had with Campari. We started the meal with the house made Burrata Cheese $17, which was so delicate and soft. But it was a touch plain, and needed some contrast of the flavors to avoid getting monotonous. We still had some of the wonderful crusty house made breads, which worked well as a counterpoint. Next was their signature Spaghetti $24. It was very good and perfectly seasoned, but again we felt it could use more contrast, especially if it were you're only main dish.  We had only one misfire: The Ravioli $30. It gets so many rave reviews, but it was sadly under-cooked. Tried to eat our way thru, but finally gave up. The server was super polite and understanding about it, and immediately urged us to get us something else (this to me is mark of a quality restaurant.) We opted for the Agnoloti that was filled with Short Ribs & Bone Marrow $27. It came out quickly and OMFG... it was cooked perfectly, and literally melted in our mouths. For dessert, they surprised us with a special Anniversary Dessert of Petit fours and Sparkling Wine (see photo.) What a wonderful meal for our last night in NYC! We would definitely visit again. NOTE: the ambiance is very sophisticated, but it can get a bit dark. I wish they could turn the lights up a bit more to avoid cell phone flashlight usage. We got high-beamed several times later in the evening, which detracted from our visit.
We traveled here from Arizona and didn't come here because we had so many chain restaurants of Grimaldi's in our own town. Boy, were we WRONG to miss this on our first trip!! We went on a food tour and heard that the reason this one is so popular is because if the water and how it affects the taste of the crust. In fact, the pizza was so different that they had to bring in a special water filtration system in AZ to try to make the pizza taste the same. Today I had our first pizza here in New York and can honestly say it is 100x better than any of the chain restaurants. Don't miss this stop! It was one of our best meals!!
I was so excited to come back here. We ordered the Margarita pizza since it was just two of us. What a let down that was. It lacked salt, flavor and just over taste. The only thing hat saved this pizza  Was we added meatballs. They were flavorful and soft and made me content.  We spilt the penne vodka with shrimp and it really saved the night for me. It was rich and saucy. The shrimp cooked perfectly.  I guess it wasn't my night or I'll have to come to try their signature old fashion pizza.
Poor service, bad food, rude staff who don't understand English (had to repeat everything up  3-5 times and still they got it wrong). Rushed us during the entire meal. Horrible never coming back
Went with a couple of colleges for a late meal. Food was very good. Atmosphere was jovial and the bartender/waiter made us feel welcome. A little noisy but that is part of the feel of the place.
Sat at the bar.  Felt really rushed. Food came out way too quickly. Was mostly too cold.
"We live just a four minute walk away and have passed this place hundreds of times. We have always wanted to try it, but it's always been empty so we were reluctant.  The atmosphere is quite quaint and sea themed. Loved the cute cups on the tables. Price is right for the entrees.  However, the glassware was dirty and table wasn't clean. Little hairs in the milk and grime on the French press. That's fine I guess..maybe it's part of the theme? Whatever. This wasn't the worst part of our experience.  I got the crab Benedict. The eggs weren't runny like they should be and cooked through solid. The crab cakes were pretty good, not the best.  Our food was dry, under seasoned, and cold. Add some salt!   I didn't eat my side and let the waiter know that it was particularly cold. All he said was ""okay"" then walked away quickly and did not apologize or offer to fix it. Then he brought us the check. Very very rude.  I wasn't looking for a discount, which I probably should have received, but more of an apology or offer to warm the potatoes. This is really bad customer service. Too bad that we live so close, but will never return.  come here if you want cold, mediocre food and bad service."
"Many of my friends have had bad experiences here related to rude staff and errors when ordering for delivery but I've tried to overlook this because I enjoy their dishes like the pineapple fried rice and pad kee Mao. But when you walk in and you're the only customer and the worker stares at you saying ""no outside beverages"" and throws out your recently purchased coffees without remorse, that makes me not want to return. He probably knew we would stay since it was pouring outside and every other restaurant was on lunch break. Like this ain't some fancy 5star restaurant; is my innocent cup going to ruin the ambience? If anything, it makes me want to not order a drink from them even more. I understand every restaurant has its own policies but I'd rather go somewhere else with better customer service."
After a Yelp Off-Broadway event, we were herded through the Times Square crowd and stumbled into *gasp* a 2nd Los Tacos No 1 (No 2?) location. At this hour (9:30p), they were already out of the adobada (wah) so we settled for our second best, the carne asada. Still amazingly scrumptious. I liked that the condiments were placed away from the taco counter line so it didn't crowd up the space like their original counterpart. Stand up eating only. Hopefully this second TS locale will alleviate some of the congestion in Chelsea Market.
Soup dumpling was one of my favorite dishes back in China and I always struggle to find a decent one that could bring back my memory back at home. Joe's Shanghai is close, but the soup base was a bit too greasy. Therefore when my friend recommended Yaso Tangbao to me, I knew instantaneously I need to try it out. I'm so glad I did! Even Though Yaso does not carry a long menu, each single dish I tried was hearty. Besides my personal favorite blue crab with pork soup dumplings, which were flavorful yet not too greasy; the garden veggie dumpling was a sweet surprise, as the chopped carrot was able to absorb the meat juice completely. Without hesitation, we ordered the sweet pumpkin cake - I could literally feel the coconut sprinkle falling out of my mouth! I simply wish I could eat more! Physically located in Brooklyn, Yaso can be reached by taking the subway conveniently. If you are a big fan of soup dumpling, Yaso hands down!
I don't often post reviews, but this warrants a few comments.  My husband and I live in the neighborhood and finally got around to try Westville, along with a friend (this was for dinner on a Saturday).  The food was good but our experience with the hostess was negative.  She was unfriendly from the start and became visibly irritated when we requested a specific table, despite the fact that the restaurant was only half full (probably less).  Ultimately, we were seated at one of the tables we liked, but the process was unpleasant.  Her behavior, tone, and choice of words were inappropriate and we felt unwelcomed.  I should also mention that we did nothing to invite this treatment and always treat people with courtesy and respect.
Amazing food terrible service and hard chairs. I have been here many times and will come again, the chef knows how to cook! Prepare to be annoyed by the staff and once again the hard chairs .
This place is the definition of hole-in-the-wall. The beef noodle soup came out hot and stayed hot for a surprisingly long time. The noodles were chewy and so yummy, you could tell they were freshly made. This soup hit the spot on the coldest day!! You have to come here...I would say don't come with more than a couple other people though since the place is small and seating is limited.
If you have heard people go on and on about their corn it's for a reason - IT IS UNREAL. The wait was around an hour because it was a tiny place and it was defiantly a bit loud - works best for small groups.  The rest of their food was fine but not comparable to the appetizers. The cuban sandwich is technically the best in New York. I haven't had many others to compare but it was pretty tasty - although nothing unexpected.
Great food. Will return again when I'm in Ct. very cool atmosphere. A lot of young kids. The fish tacos are the best!!!
With so many decent seafood joints serving good lobster and oyster rolls, I was pretty disappointed with the quality of food at Fish.  I stopped by here with a couple of friends and a baby. I got the oyster roll and my friend got a lobster roll. His lobster roll looked so unappetizing, I didn't even bother asking him to let me try it. My oyster roll didn't fare much better. The batter on the fried oysters didn't have much flavor and the roll was just bleh.. The service was pretty friendly and that was probably the highlight. Otherwise a pretty unmemorable experience and I dont want to waste too much time writing about it.
The food is pretty good. Avocado salad is really tasty. spicy fried rice is also really good. Also recommend the eel rice.  HOWEVER we probably won't visit there again because of the BAD SERVICE!!!!!!!!!! The waitress showed bad attitude from the minute we sit down and in end the waitress stopped us and asked for more tips with bad attitude... we hinted that the service is not good to deserve more tips but the waitress was mean and keep demanding more tips until we specially pointed out where she did bad service. One example is that we never get water refill and she argued that we should ask... and that is service deserve more tip?!?! That's was just an example. We love the food a lot but we don't think we will come back anymore.
slow service, small portions, huge markup.
We loved Ippudo! We had these soft shell beef tounge and OMG! IT was amazing! I think it was a seasonal special but if you get a chance enjoy that! The ramen was good as well. Coming from Vancouver, our ramen standards are pretty high but given that it is NYC! Ippudo did an amazing job!
I was visiting my friend in NYC and she picked this restaurant for us to go to! They don't take reservations for parties under 6 so we ended up waiting a little bit for our table. Luckily, we went in the early evening and did not have to wait too long.  The inside of the restaurant is a little cramped and small but it is worth enduring for the delicious food.  We started out with the roasted garlic with focaccia bread which was amazing. They give you three pieces of bread with the dish which is not nearly enough. However, if you ask nicely, you may be able to get a few extra pieces. The roasted garlic spread upon on the warm bread is delicious. I highly recommend this dish! For my entree, I chose the eggplant with lamb lasagna. I have never had lasagna which had eggplant in place of noodles so I did not know what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised! It was delicious and I actually did not miss the noodles because the eggplant was a perfect substitute. The eggplant paired perfectly with the lamb so I devoured every bit of it.  I tried my friend's peri peri chicken which was tender and flavorful.  Overall, this place did not disappoint and is worth the wait if there is a long line.
Found this place by chance! Great drinks and food was very good.  We had to negotiate over who would get the last Pork Belly Toastada.   Atmosphere was good... a bit loud but that is a personal preference.  Thanks for the great evening Dutch Freds.
After reading a NY Times article about Sea Witch, I decided to check it out for myself. I must say, I really like this place. It has a chic, non-cheesy Maritime decor replete with waterfalls in the backyard patio area. It attracts a hip but unpretentious mixed crowd. The prices are great, and with the Scoutmob app I got  50% off my entire bill. This is one of my new fave spots, so needless to say... I'll be back!
Really enjoyed my meal at Thursday kitchen. I went with my boyfriend on a Sunday night, and we ordered four small plates including: crispy chicken, soft shell crab, truffle macaroni and cheese and pork belly. Everything was super well cooked and delicious! Not all the food came at the same time, and you had no choice in the order. However, other than that I thought everything was great! Would definitely return! Very cute ambiance and super detail oriented; I thought it was cute their name was on the napkins!
French toast was OK. Nothing amazing! Cute atmosphere overall decent experience!
Came here on a Saturday night with 6 friends.  Yuzu sake was super sweet. Toro Uni is def one of their best dishes. Also tried the okonimiyaki which was one of their better dishes. Overall pretty good experience for casual dine out with a group of friends!
I love the ambience here, but the late night staff is unavailable, IE no server...my brother and I ordered the Cooper's Poutine: Fries, Cheese Curds, Bacon Oxtail Gravy, and Pickled Chiles but it was like warm. Not s great first impression but we could tell the flavor was delicious. Bar tender told us there was no server when we walked in...that signified he'd be serving but our food came out relatively fast, within 10 mins, so I'm not sure how it was already cold. I LOVE cheese curds and while they were fresh they hardly met my expectations. Perhaps it was an off night. Should I ever return, hope to have a better experience. I'll consider coming back during regular hours for a new experience.
Came on Monday night a couple weeks ago with my girls to celebrate our birthdays. The place was super packed, got overcharged for 3 glasses of Moët and never got them, even tho we ordered. Our waitress was kind of rude so the other girl replaced her in 20 minutes even tho we didn't say anything. That was kind of weird experience but I wouldn't recommend to stay there more than for 1 drink.
Had lunch here.  No wait despite it being very popular. Service was efficient and fast. Tried the Samurai lobster roll. Very impressed as I usually find lobster rolls bland but this was packed with flavor.  The added ginger gives it a spicy and fresh kick. The fries were delicious and not overcooked...hate french fries that are overdone.  The side salad was lightly dressed in a simple balsamic based dressing I will be back
Everytime I come here it gets worse. The service is shit. The food is always over or undercooked.  I hate being dragged here and actively warn people not to show up. Seriously. Don't waste your time or money. Update: home of the world's most disappointing burrito.
If you've been to New Orleans, then you know the food is on another level; you also know that getting a craving for said food is hard to quench.  Sugar freak can totally satisfy that craving and then some. Sugar Freak embodies the funkiness of New Orleans; the vibe and decor suit it perfectly.  The food, the food is sensational. Beers on tap were Abita. We started off the with the hush puppies.  Large fried puffs of corn were delivered alongside 2 dipping sauces.  The hush puppies themselves were light and airy with a perfect crispness outside.  The dipping sauces brought them to another level.  The honey chili sauce was my favorite, no the condensed milk sauce was, no....I couldn't decide. Moving on to entrees, the red beans and rice was delicious as was the corn bread that accompanied it.  The catfish and crawfish etouffee was splendid, it could have been spicier, but that didn't deter me as I almost licked my plate clean. The collard greens were just about perfect, it was a fabulous meal. We grabbed a banana pudding to go and it was creamy, decadent and bursting with bananas; it's an excellent version. Between the food, the atmosphere and the awesome service we experienced, Sugar Freak made for a wonderful dinner.
I visited this place three times with my boyfriend because I love love love their spicy chicken sandwich. Each time we went, my boyfriend hated whatever he ordered and the service was non existent. The waitress kept squeezing passed our table and literally ignoring us, even after we called out to her. Our orders came out 45m after we placed the order the two times we stayed long enough to oder.  We filled up on beer and the outdoor seating while we waited.  The third time, my boyfriend tried to ignore how snippy the waitress was and sat for a drink but the service was just consistently bad that we got up and walked out. We had different waitresses each time and they were all rude and always annoyed about something. I kept making excuses for them to my boyfriend but the third time just seemed like we'd never get good service.
Very disappointed in this place. Friend of mind heard about it recently and wanted to try it out, ok.... Well, server was nice but did not explain the dishes very well. The seafood soup was water with 3 shrimps and some diced up vegetables, just a scoop of them.  Their signature dish, Boca Chia...had no flavor. Very disappointed. Buddy ordered the skirt steak medium, and they served it well. To tuff, so he asked for extra chimichura, which was all oil.... Server never came back to check in on us. We left half the meal there.  When the host ask how things was, I told her. She looked shocked and said she would address it with the kitchen. Told her it was our first and last time here.
The food is of very good quality don't get me wrong everything is made in a small little kitchen that you can see...along with waiters giving new plates and utensils with every new dish you order.  I would go back for the desert(IT WAS GREAT) and sliders(great but too small) but there was some obvious big problems.  Problem 1: The menu is really long and they suggest that you order at least 6 things since portions are small and trust me there not cheap. Your looking at an easy over 80  for two people if your trying to fill up. Problem two: I like to relax and think about things before I order I'm usually extremely undecided and I think its okay I mean your paying them money. When I didn't know what I wasted after the waitress came back twice she said that this table is reserved for someone that they reserve time blocks kind of rushing me, well not kind of. How rude? Problem 3: Portions are small if you have money to spend go on an empty stomach and spend! If you don't want to spend a lot of money on food that's not really going to fill you up maybe pre-eat then go! Might go back for desert and sliders as a snack just portions are way to small. The seal of the deal was at the end they offered us complimentary pineapple they literally brought us a pineapple chunk like one chunk each, yes the chunk from canned pineapple.
"I ordered via seamless, at 9pm the order was confirmed, got a phone call 45minutes later with a rude person on the other end saying ""my delivery driver is ""messed up"", it'll be up to another hour for your food do you still want it?"" I say ""yes, no problem i can wait"" BIG mistake, its now 12:20am im out of $20 and no dinner, what sucks the most its that its too late for anything in my area to be open, no dinner tonight, thanks houdini, decent pizza (for the area) but very poorly executed, oh and i keep trying to call and the phone is turned off, it just says ""im sorry but the person you called did not activate the voice messaging service"" how shitty!   P.S.  I wrote this review because its the second time I've had this issue, i think i should just stop ordering from here all together."
"I was at Minetta Tavern last night and right after we ordered I saw in the corner of my eye 4 mice running around. I waited a second and saw them again scrambling around the restaurant. I told my waiter and he said to me ""it's New York, grow up.""   I was more telling him as an FYI and he gave me this arrogant attitude. One of the bus boys went over to tell the manager and he couldn't care less. The manager didn't even come over to address it with us!  As we were leaving the smart *ss waiter goes "" I hope you enjoyed your night!"" The burgers are awesome but I am never going back after dealing with that arrogance.  Minetta you have RODENT problem."
I went here for dinner before seeing a film for the TFF. And while the service and decor are fine..the portions are cheap..let me explain..yes  you get free popcorn..woohoo.. I ordered an iced tea which tasted off so to say we are sorry, I get two chicken wings..thanks? I ordered the Duxelle, which was really good but then I asked for additional bread cause you know you always get more of the item then the bread or cracker to put it on..they charge me for the additional bread..great hospitality.. As a main course, I ordered the smoked duck with pineapple which was very good, but three slices of duck and three slices of pineapple and a speckle of onion for  $27 bucks..Come on..that is pathetic... So my advice..if you want good food and dont want to be full after spending an adequate amount on it, go here..perhaps drinks and bar fare are the way to go here..The burger looked amazing and the tator tots are made in kitchen, which my guest ordered, but again, I think they gave her like 4 tator tots..I felt like we were dining during the great depression...
The food was great! I recommend the chick peas. Drinks were decent. However, there was NO HEAT!!! My party and I were freezing! We begged for heat. The owner should have at least picked up food or drink tab! We were wearing coats.
"I would give 4.5. Prime steak taco-delicious. Very tender and juicy chopped steak. Good quality. Pork taco-very good. A lot of grilled pork. Pretty salty. Chicken taco-delicious. Very juicy chicken. Cactus taco-average. Sour cactus pickles. Not very used to this taste. All tacos are ""con todos"". Tasty sauces. The best tacos I've had so far."
I was in town for work and grabbed dinner with a friend at The Boil. One word: AHMAZING I had shrimp and crawfish with the boil special sauce and nearly cried at the thought of how good everything tasted. The server was very attentive and everyone was super friendly (from getting us new gloves to tying our bibs to consistently checking in on us. IT WAS WORTH THE TRIP!
The place is very small, street Parking only. Ordered palabok, sauce taste a lot like the palabok mix. Pansit bihon comes in with only with 2 types of veggies, cut up string beans & napa cabbage (no carrots & half cooked onions at least) for $8.95. I prefer the bihon in the market place in the Philippines at least that comes in with dried tiny shrimp & half cook onions. The rest of the foods were so so, Kare Kare, Shanghai Spring rolls, Lechon Kawali nothing sticks out for me to keep coming back here. Serving were rather small portion except for the white rice, compared to the other places I've been to.  The table were uneven towards the comer food might end up on the floor if not careful. The plastic or glass table cover on one of the table has a broken edge that might cut your arm if you lean on it. Lastly if your going to order anything fried, be prepared to smell like that food. I don't know if they have exhaust, but my wife's eyes started tearing cause of the smoke after a few minutes of seating there while the food is being cooked.  I went here cause of the high 4 & 5 stars reviews, talking about the authenticity of taste of the Filipino foods. I guess we all have our own authentic kinda of taste. Sorry,  but this place is not for me!
A small place but there's seating downstairs also. We started out with the steamed pork and vegetable dumplings. Not many places has ponzu sauce available but you must try the dumplings with this sauce! It's so yummy!  I ordered the general tso chicken. I would recommend getting the small. It was a good size portion. The sauce tasted similar to orange chicken but it was still good. My only concern is the sauce was a super thick sauce that kinda resembled putty. I tried to dip the broccoli in the sauce but it wouldnt even stick.  Also, jasmine tea is given with every table and it's very refreshing to drink between bites or after your meal. But overall this place is a cheap but good place to eat!
"Did not get our orders for hours, and then... 1. Got ignored multiple times when we tried to follow up with the waiters  2. The response we finally received was that the order was never processed since the guy who took the order ended his shift (-_-?!?!?!?) 3. The person who brought us the bill was like ""you guys stayed here for a long time"" with a ''smile"" on his face. He showed us the bill on an ipad quickly, and we had to pay right away w/o having a copy of the receipt or doing the calculations ourselves. Plus, the guy was holding the ipad, and staring at the screen the whole time when we chose the tip amount. Will not revisit or recommend to others."
"Have been here multiple times especially for brunch since it's just around my apt.  I come here for the decent food but every time I come I've always noticed their bad careless customer service.  Even when I order a take out to minimize my time dealing with being inside, I was forgotten by the host.  I had to have the manager ask for the status of my food which he asked the host then pulled my food from the host stand/desk.  Instead of simple apology for service recovery, the host looked at me and said ""oh I thought you were outside"" then walked away. I clearly said I was sitting at the bar and he was the one to sit me down."
Confirmed what all other Yelpers are saying, it's a great Southern Seafood Restauraunt in NYC. We arrived at 6.30 on a Friday evening and was able to be seated immediately,  I think because it was a rainy afternnoon. However the place is not too big so I can see the reason why patrons have to wait in line in order to have thier dunner. The greeter to the servers were all very friendly and they took great care to constantly remove the containers that is used to place the shells. The food is excellent,  we had fried Calamari and Crab Cakes to start with then for main the steam crab legs.  I would have given The Boil  a five star but I subtracted one because they are not accepting credit cards which I find as an annoyance and very inconvenient.
Cute atmosphere, spacious, and great service. The clientele here during HH seems older (30s+).  My friend and I got drinks and an app. The drinks were straight from the bottle, so not much to be said there. We got the eggplant fries with curry aioli. The eggplant fries were good and crispy. Expensive for what it was, but good nonetheless. I personally didn't like the curry aioli. It's nice, but as you continue to eat, the curry flavor compounds and becomes too intense and overpowering.  I think I'll check this place out another time and see how the clientele is then.
I would say the Benedict egg is OK. The service is OK. However the latte which is almost $4 without tax, I believe it's instant coffee or at least they didn't use real milk(which means creamer , coffee mate etc. ). This is too bad to me even as a non professional coffee shop. So one star for Benedict egg, one for service, if the coffee was not that bad, there'll be three stars and I'll round it up to four.
It used to be my favorite sandwich place but not anymore. Quality of food is going down the hill. Sandwich bread is served without toasted, meat was like a frozen meat, sometimes smelly. I hope the owner will pay more attention of what they are serving.
My friends and I came here for Sunday brunch. We had made a reservation for 8 people at 11am. We were seated right away but half of our party was running late, so the staff got pretty annoyed at us. We didn't begin ordering until 11:45am but they kept insisting that next time, we shouldn't sit until our whole party was present because they had other reservations after us (which seemed a little unnecessary because there was plenty of other open tables besides ours). Everyone at our table got the Egg in a Cloud, except for one who ordered the Smoked Salmon Sandwich. The Egg in a Cloud looked gorgeous and was super fluffy. I devoured mine within minutes. It was filling enough, because I also ordered a drink and I wasn't particularly hungry to begin with. If you're looking for a filling meal after a night of going out, however, this isn't the place for you. I also got the homemade iced lemonade, which was very interesting. It wasn't terrible - it was just very lemony and more like slightly sweetened lemon juice than lemonade. 3 stars because I liked trying the Egg in a Cloud but I wouldn't recommend my friends to go here. There are many other brunch places where you get the most bang for your buck.
Just left here  and I can say that I was not happy with my food. I had never been to this particular restaurant so I ordered with caution. I ordered the special a lobster tail with pasta  ,soup, coffee, dessert and garlic bread. Let's say I received a baby lobster tail with pasta. The lobster tail had more bread than meat  the pasta with oil and cut up garlic. The best part  of the entire meal was the bread.  I was never given my coffee or dessert.  The waitress was running around worried more about tables then her costumers.  I paid the bill and left . I did not want to draw attention so I even left a tip, but I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THEIR ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN! I love food and I would have  loved to add them to my favorites list for myself and family.
Food is amazing, but the music (trap music) makes me want to gauge my eyes out and never eat here again. Better off getting take out. Seriously. Horrible music. Management, don't let staff play such bad music.
You can't always have a great meal, can you? Went on a Monday night at 7:15ish...waited...waited...then got seated. Just a party of 2. We ordered. I got the hot chicken and my friend got the shrimp sandwich.  ...waited...waited...waited...couple next to us who came after us get their meal....waited....waited....party of 5 who got seated at the same time as us get their food....waited....wanted to eat my arm off....waited...finally waitress tells us our food is 5 minutes away. Which i don't understand because people who came in WELLL after us got their food.  I'm not sure if the take-out orders were taken priority over our meal. long story short we waited an hour for our food...they didn't even offer us corn bread while we waited.  I was starving. Mashed potatoes...not that great kind of tasted instant. Chicken was fine, nothing out of this world but for the price it was fine. The shrimp sandwich must have been sitting for a while because it was very very soggy. Maybe it was just an off night there?
"The key is to get here from 6-7PM so that you  1: beat the inevitable line. This place WILL fill up. We got here before it opened on a Wednesday and by the time we left around 7:30PM, there were a couple parties waiting. 2. can redeem the Yelp check in offer for 1 free Sapporo (6-6:30PM) The food is tasty and decently priced, the portions are larger than traditional tapas, and the staff is attentive and helpful. They recommend 2 plates per person to share. Between 3 chicks, we ordered 6 dishes and 1 dessert, and were able to demolish everything. [FOOD] Get: Seafood Pancake (11) - Crispy on the outside and full of seafood! Soft Shell Crab (11) - The pickled tomatoes that came with this were so yummy! Truffle Mac & Cheese (10) - Who would've guessed that a Korean tapas spot would have bomb mac & cheese? This was super cheesy, creamy, and delicious.  Crispy Chicken (10) - This took the longest to come out. It's basically white meat chicken nuggets covered in a sweet and slightly spicy sauce. I think I would've enjoyed this more if it didn't come out when we were already full. Popcorn Ice cream (9) - Always make room for dessert. The salted caramel sauce was heavenly! Skip: Avocado (9) - This was the only dish I was disappointed with. It was literally a sliced avocado with a yuzu sauce. Tasty, but I would order something else. Angry Sweet Potato (9) - The sweet potato fries were kinda dry [DRINK] This place is known for the adult Capri Suns, aka soju cocktails in Capri Sun-esque pouches with an LED ""ice cube"". The presentation is innovative and great for pics.  Lychee Reach Rich - soju, mango, and lychee. Our server said that this was one of the boozier options. The drink was delicious and not too sweet. Highly recommend! Everything on the menu looks delicious so I will definitely be back to try more!"
Great place to grab drinks with friends. The atmosphere is always lively, atleast in the summer, spring. Food is street food, nothing exciting served on paper plates. This place wins due to their beer and sangrias. I had a Bronx Ale and my GF had a sangria. Again, great place to grab drinks, relax, vibe out to the DJ but skip the food here. One thumb up over here
I went to Up Thai over the weekend with some friends and, while it was good, it did not quite live up to the hype. One area where Up Thai really excelled was the interior.  It is a gorgeous space, pretty large, with great decor.  It rivals Thai Villa as the nicest looking Thai restaurant in Manhattan. The lunch specials are a pretty good deal; $10 for a soup or salar, appetizer, and entree, with some additional cost if you get a fancier meat in your dish, such as duck. There were five of us, and we ordered a total of four lunches.  Four our appetizers, we got to try the soup and the salad, and had a mix of steamed dumplings, which are filled with chicken and shrimp, and net rolls, which are filled with crab and shrimp.  The soup had a really light and good flavor and, even though small, had a lot of tofu in it, which was nice.  The salad was pretty standard; it had the usual ginger dressing on it and was tasty, but nothing special.  The net roll has a crispy outside and has a good amount of shrimp and crab; it was a good choice.  I didn't get to try the steamed dumplings, but my friends seemed to like them. Overall, with the exception of the net rolls, the lunch appetizers are pretty much your standard Thai lunch appetizer offerings. For entrees, my friends had pad thai and moo dang.  I got to try the pad thai, and it was good, but nothing too special.  My fiance had been to Up Thai for lunch previously and she told me that the pad thai was larger and had more sauce and was tastier her first time there.  Perhaps they were having a bad day this weekend?  I had the pra ram with fried squid.  The squid was cooked really well and wasn't chewy at all.  And there was sufficient vegetables in it.  The peanut sauce was really good and slightly sweet.  My only complaint is that the dish was so small. Based on this one experience, I would say that Up Thai is a solid but not-so-special Thai restaurant.  It's lunch offerings are pretty standard, as are the prices, and the portions were somewhat small.  I do not know if I will return, but if I do, I hope it lives up to all the hype next time because this time it did not. I want to rate this 3 stars but the beautiful atmosphere bumps it to a 4, barely.
I took my mom and dad who were in town visiting me here for lunch today with my fiancé after a recommendation from the people at Infatuation. The decor is adorable! it was pretty full for noon on a Tuesday in Williamsburg, I live down the street. we started with the hummus platter which was absolutely delicious. my dad had the iced tea and raved about it. I had the lamb as my entree which was done absolutely perfectly. everyone enjoyed their food. the reason for only 3 stars is unfortunately because the service here is terrible. we had a young man as our waiter who was very nice, except we saw him maybe two times. during our meal I ordered a corona which never showed up. there was however a light haired woman who was incredibly sweet especially to my father who is king of corny dad jokes. it's such a shame. the food really is so good but service, not so much :(
Came here on a cold Saturday after spending a few hours in Bryant Park. The place was packed, but it was only 2 of us and the hostess said it would only be a 5 minute wait. Everything looked and smelled so good in there. A lot of the tables were very close to one another, so be prepared to be sitting very close to your neighbors. We were seated upstairs right next to the wall in a two top, so luckily we only had diners on the other side of us. We looked over the menu for a bit, and while doing so i remembered to check in on Yelp to receive a free shot of soju! We placed drink orders and continued to look over the menu. We decided on two different tapas. The truffle fries and the pork belly nachos. The truffle fries were great! Had a nice crunch and the truffle flavor was not over powering at all. It was a great dish to share. The pork belly nachos were served on a wonton wrapper. It was kind of hard to eat unless you ate it in one bite. Which is not very attractive.  For our mains i ordered the sea urchin bibimbap. It was so flavorful and refreshing. It came with miso soup. My date had the bulgogi which he loved! His was also served with a miso soup. The soups did come out the same time as the entree, that was kind of weird. Service was excellent there. Even though i could tell our server was busy he was always patient with us, and we never felt rushed. He even threw in another shot on the house after chatting with us for a bit!
After living in Portland and eating at Pok Pok regularly, I thought I was in for something special at the Brooklyn outpost, but our lunch here was sorely disappointing.  First off the prices for the food are not in line with the ho-hum service and decor, and then there's the food. Sadly disappointing, lacking flavor, depth, and creativity. Not a single dish was remarkable. We left thankful that we ordered small to start figuring we could add to the order. We didn't finish anything, opting instead to cut our losses and grab a hot dog at ikea.  If you find yourself in Portland, Pok Pok shouldn't be missed, however the magic and the flavor of the original got lost somewhere on the journey east.
Came here for lunch with a few friends on Christmas day after doing some research for a good place. It was about a half hour wait. Once inside, the service was very quick. We ordered appetizers (cold noodles, dumplings and spring rolls) and main meals (I ordered soup) which came in pretty big portions, and ran us all around $17 a person! Everything tasted pretty good. We were all pretty pleased with our decision to come here and see why it got such good reviews!
After reading other reviews, I decided to stop by while in NY. It. Was. SO. Worth. It. I got the adobada taco (pic) with a horchata. Don't be discouraged by long lines--after you pay, everything moves along pretty quickly. It took about 5-6 minutes for our orders to arrive. The only minor problem was that there are no places to sit. There's a limited number of standing tables to eat at but if you're looking for a sit-down place, you'll want to look somewhere else.
"I came to dinner with my bestie on a Monday night following a Yelp event that was held fairly close by. The ambiance at Clover Club is lovely, all of the furniture and decor is a dark, wood finish, almost like a 1920s-30s library meets pub feel, quite speak-easy-ish interior. There are little tables set up in the front, and a nice sized bar if you continue walking toward the back. Clover club offers a very classic, Gatsby era feel. I love the open doors overlooking the street as you dine at the small tables. Shout out to the pet owner who let his dog take a stinky and prolonged  s**t right in front of the door in view of everyone dining, then left it there in front of the door where three people stepped in it with heels, you da real MVP.  The hostess was phenomenal, very charismatic and efficient. Our waitress? I think they wrangled her out of her usual day job twenty minutes after we were seated and were like, ""You're a waitress for these people now, OK?"" This was a Monday night, 4-6 people in total were dining and we had to wait a half hour before she checked in on us to order. She came over to our table and said not a word. No how are you, no can I take your order, nothing! So awkward! So, we just began ordering. She looked at us blankly, mumbled a few items back to us to confirm, and scurried away. When we got our food, she never checked on us once OR ANYONE ELSE. She just completely vanished, we had to wait forever to get a check too! WEIRDO. Every time we saw her she never talked! Just stood there! Food: Food was BANGIN! Does anyone say bangin' anymore? Maybe I'm the weirdo now. We got the mac and cheese which, although a bit hard, was excellent, SO CHEESY, and filling. Definitely an upscale mac and cheese. The crispy rock shrimp was excellent and was a large sized portion, easy to split! The crostini with burrata was pretty good. I'm used to burrata just being served plain, so to have it smeared on bread with some peas, mint, etc. was different and yummy. The fried oysters were great, almost like a calamari with pesto, delishhh. My favorite? The crisps! Oh lord, one of the finest snacks to touch my palate...and I am a HUGE snack fan! Homemade potato chips tossed in duck fat with a side of truffle creme sauce...heaven on earth. You can taste all of the flavors and they work in the most amazing way together. I've had duck fat fries before, tasted no different than regular fries. These chips with the sauce? Simply the best. We tried the Gold Coast drink, which of course took 20 minutes to get, our poor hostess had to get them because our waitress was probably off being awkward somewhere. Gold Coast drinks were beautiful. The taste? OK, a bit strong and tough to drink...nothing I'd order again. Drink menu was interesting, again seemed very Gatsby/1920s speakeasy themed. Unsure if I'd come back again, maybe if I was in the area."
Definitely need to make reservations if you do not want to wait a long time! Wait at least over an hour and a half. Thank god they text you when your table is ready so you can go do something else while you wait. You are offered complimentary cocktail/juice with your brunch entree for Sunday brunches, which I think is a plus cause usually their cocktails are like $10. The Vanilla Bean French Toast ($18, $3 extra for strawberries and bananas) looked like a basic French Toast but it was so good, it was full of flavor. The inside is soft and doesn't taste soggy when you pour syrup on it. Definitely recommend ordering this.  The Jane Benedict ($24) is definitely a must try too if you don't want your usual benedicts. Instead of the usual bread it comes with, it's crab cakes. It was really yummy. It comes with home fries and a salad. The home fries were good, soft on the inside and the skin was crispy.
I just wasnt impressed. I came here with high expectations from all the wonderful reviews. We had reservations and were seated promptly. the waitress was very nice however our first appetizer came before our drinks did. one star down, mama likes to drink. and as for the food, well, i've had better. we ordered the fried chick peas, meatballs, fried pork belly, grilled octopus and bacon wrapped dates. the chick peas tasted like nothing. literally nothing. the dates were good, although i believe i make it better. the pork belly needed salt, and the polenta was too watery for my liking. the highlight of the meal was the octopus and meatballs. so for food, another star down.  as for the drinks, i had a glass of sangria, and my mister has a manhattan. both drinks were fine. the place itself is very pretty. but slightly cramped, another star down. makes for a nice date night. but would i come back? i dont think so.
"Definitely a spot that can become my ""usual"". The restaurant is absolutely beautiful + in one of my fave areas of BK. I made reservations for 1:30pm but was running late so called to push it back; they were so accommodating + for a Sat that's amazing. When we arrived we were promptly seated.  We ordered the oysters; they were so fresh + delicious.  My main was Eggs Florentine w/ spinach + a side order of smoke bacon. Eggs Florentine was so delicious that I cleaned my plate. As for the smoked bacon; what a huge disappointment. No smoked flavor what so ever + they were thin cut too. It tasted like the packaged bacon packs I buy from the supermarket (major smh!). So don't order the bacon not worth it."
The hostess is in the wrong industry. We came with more people than expected (which normally a business would appreciate), but she basically lost her mind and thought the world was going to end. So she went crying to the manager. The manager who came to try and rectify the situation looked like he just graduated high school, didn't offer any real solution, and basically went back to playing Pokémon on his iPhone after asking 2 people in our group to leave the dining area because apparently we were disturbing other tables with our presence. It's a great and unique space but basically run by bunch of pre-teens who were trained to work on a boat by watching episodes of Dawson's Creek.
We walk-in and there's a huge line right by the bar area. Im in shock since this is my first time at the steak house. My friends are all sitting by the bar and they both ordered a drink. They ask if I want anything, I just say water. The bartender says something sarcastic and right at that moment I knew this was going to be a great place. Nothing pretentious since what you see is what you get. We had to wait ten minutes after our reservation time, but I can see why as everyone is bustling around.  Anyways, we get seated and our waiter starts joking around immediately. Really friendly and genuine. We start off by ordering a bottle of Napa Valley, Monticello Vineyards 2014, Cabernet. It went well with what we ordered. We ordered two bacon slices, a steak for two, and cream spinach. All I can say is whoa! Only three ladies so we were stuffed at the end. The portions were huge. Of course, the bacon was amazing and it exceeded my expectations. The waiter said to try it with and without the sauce. He was right as it was great both ways. Afterwards, we ate the sizzling steak. Couldn't believe how my tastebuds came alive with and without the sauce. The cream of spinach has a secret ingredient. I can't say, but ask your waiter.  For dessert we of course ate the sundae for my friends bday. The waitstaff sang to her and they were so jolly. All in all, I would definitely come back and try the other sides and desserts.
It was a very good experience here, I came here with my friends for my birthday dinner and everything was good. everyone was very nice and funny. very good service and. And yes I would surely recommend this place to my friends.
4.5/5 Ippudo ramen is one of the best ramen restaurants in NYC. As many of the reviews have stated, the wait for Ippudo can be long. My advice to avoid the long wait is to arrive 30-45min before they open for dinner so around 4:15-4:30pm. My brother and I got there at 4:30pm and there was already a fairly long line outside of the restaurant, but we were able to be seated right away once they opened.  For an appetizer, I recommend their pork buns (better than Totto ramen). For their ramen I really enjoyed their Karaka-Men (spicy tonkotsu). In terms of their overall quality, it is slightly better than Totto ramen, but the wait time for Ippudo tends to be much longer than Totto. If you are up for waiting then Ippudo will not disappoint.
You can never go wrong with Thai food... especially not at Thai Villa! This is probably the best Thai place I've tried. The dishes are unique and although you can get the same plates at places like Spice and Somtum Der, trust me when I say that Thai Villa is betttter. No reservations are taken on Friday-Sunday, so be sure to come here early around 6-6:30 because it gets packed very quickly. I love this restaurant's decor and its seats--sadly we didn't get to sit in a booth. So if you want to have a more than comfy dining experience, come in groups :)  On the house: small sampling of pork + pineapple on a stick. The pork is so good!!  Drink: the classic Thai iced tea - sweeter than ever and not too creamy. Appetizer: Ray Rai Nah Phu - You can eat the leaf...hahaha. This is made to be eaten in one bite, and it tastes delicious, although I suggest eating it without the leaf anyway to get a better taste of the meat + curry. The curry is more sweet than it is spicy!  Entrees: crab fried rice and stuffed seafood crispy egg crepe - I order the same thing at every Thai restaurant: fried rice or Pad Thai. It tastes the same everywhere. Yet I was not disappointed by Thai Villa's crab fried rice; I don't know what it is, but the rice tastes more flavorful. Kudos for the attempt at molding it into a dome. The stuffed seafood crispy egg crepe is even better, although the seafood most likely tastes better than usual wrapped in the egg and dipped in the relish. 4/5 for both dishes!  Dessert: mango sticky rice - Our waitress told us that this is the best choice on the menu, but to me it's a mere 3/5. I don't like the idea of mixing rice with fruit...hard to get anything down after a few minutes. The blue coloring doesn't make it any more appealing. I don't know what else is good for dessert, but don't get this if you're not into this mix either. Overall, a positive experience. Really want to come back to try everything else on the menu, especially the appetizers. Good for date night & a casual hangout.
"What food I got was very good unfortunately ordered the ""award winning short ribs"" (bare in mind there was no one in the restaurant and this was 7:30pm on a Thursday night) and was told when my appetizer arrived they were sold out from the night before, and the new batch was still roasting and would not be ready. Quite unacceptable in my opinion considering the timing, when I  was told, and it's their signature dish, and nothing was done for my inconvenience. In a follow up response from below I was told I should have complained to the manager instead of leaving a bad review. Let me reiterate we were the only customers in the restaurant, we had a reservation made over two weeks before (it was an anniversary), and we were not informed they were out till we were served our appetizers (and we ordered them together), I think the manager should have been aware what was going on, not need to have been requested. Food may be good, but very they are very unprofessional, and don't seem to care about customers."
This place is good, but it is not 100% authentic and some of the flavors reflect that.  We arrived late on a weeknight to a full restaurant - this place is tiny - and put our name in before setting up to wait. The hostess offered for us to order wine which we did. It didn't appear and even after 20 minutes and asking, it took another 10ish minutes to arrive. We could literally see the wine bottles. Weird.  When we sat, we started with spare ribs and curry puffs. The spare ribs were AMAZING and cooked perfectly. The curry puffs tasted nothing like the real thing and were kind of bland. We lived in Thailand for a year and were SO let down.  We shared for entrees Pad See Ew with Beef which was described as coming with Chinese broccoli and cauliflower as well as egg. There were scallions and eggs. There was nothing else as explained. The lack of veg. made this dish SUPER salty and okay, but nothing that your average Chow-Fun does not reflect.  We also go the Ratchaburi Crab & Pork Dry Noodles which was the highlight for us. The noodles were cooked as they should be with a little bite and the crab and pork was well cooked. This dish was super balanced if not needing maybe a touch more broth (cooking water would have been fine too).
I'm scratching my head about the popularity of this restaurant. It's not terrible, but maybe it gives people the nostalgia of eating with their Aunt Delphyne- the one who performed reiki, ate oatmeal with garlic for breakfast and talked to her plants. I walked by a million times and have always seen it full of people, but the look of the place has never drawn me in. I finally arranged to have lunch with a friend here and it the interior felt really run-down. Rickety chairs, overgrown plants and dirty tapestry pillows strewn about. Didn't really whet my appetite...  I had a very plain salad with some pretty dry salmon and it was passable, and certainly wouldn't look forward to eating here again.
Passively aggressive presence, hidden behind a shack, and sometimes on a good day, LL will have a chalk board standing sign in the middle of a road with a punny joke. I approve. Be selfish and treat yourself to some shellfish. Heh.
Great little italian place tucked away in the financial district downtown.   Gets good marks for service and ambiance although it can be a little loud if you are seated in the bar area.  Had a couple of pasta dishes and dessert - the pasta was perfectly cooked with loads of san marzano tomatoes and a wonderful burrata.  Simple but very good.  The Orecchiette al Sugo was also delightful - loaded with pork rib ragu.  Our plates were clean! Would have loved to try the crostini and hamburger which looked awesome, but it was late - next time. Dessert was a pumpkin cheesecake, very light and flavorful - just hit the spot. Will definitely go back, it's a keeper.
this place must be so great what's one 1-star review ever so often? walked in here with my family to get something to go.  Horrible service.  I asked if they could debone the fish as we'd be eating outside - no.  I asked if we could have plastic utensils - they directed me to the deli across the street.   After some head scratching, they gave us metal forks...and to debone the fish?    What a bunch of rude disrespectful people.   Never coming back here.
We were staying at the hotel so just checked in for a beer and a sangria.  Only sat in the bar which was small, crowded and noisy.  Nothing on draft and were on the expensive side.  Even though we were there for 4 days we did not go back.
Oh, Little Owl, how you disappoint.  I had heard such great things about you, I really was expecting so much more. The restaurant itself is adorable, I loved the semi open kitchen, and the cute nook by the entrance was a charming detail.  Aesthetically, it certainly is perfect for a date spot... as long as you're not particular about the taste, or perhaps more interested in your date to notice the lackluster meal.  Personally, I go for the food. So date or no date, I'll definitely take notice if my meal is bland, under seasoned and simply put, not tasty. Maybe I went on an off day?  I ordered the meatball sliders. Let's just say that I've had better meatballs that came from the frozen section at my local grocery store.
Poor and arrogant service! I ordered by phone but ignore my order. And they looks like there nothing to do with them! Not the first time! I would never go there anymore!
The owner is very nice and friendly. We sat here for a long time without anyone rushing us today. Got our free Thai iced tea after checking in on yelp. The food came quickly and food is tasty. The owner gave mango sticky rice to my friends as birthday cake. It was yummy.
This place is so good! Love how simple the menu is. Review is for the lobster roll because it's the only thing I've tried. It's so good and buttery and they're generous with Lobster meat. Every time I consider ordering the whole lobster or burger, I'm overcome with this fear that I'll miss out on the roll! Love that it's served with a little salad and delicious fries! Def a place I'd return.
We went last night and ordered fresh Oysters. They oyster looked really tasty. So disappointed, the oyster tasted very bad and smelly. Then manager told us that oysters are imported from South Korea and  taste kinda different from U.S.A.   He said Oysters from South Korea are taste little  fishy.   Oh boy.. Can someone tell me how impossible you get the fresh oyster from South Korea in The U.S. with fishy taste. Such  a lier..
For years the local GO TO for delicious fried chicken and a family feel restaurant experience. Always busy, always vibrant, so BedStuy.  Love the new menu! Go early or expect a wait, by now they all know its fire... ;)  Great spot for Brunch! Chivon kills it on the bartending front during those hours. Make sure to have her mix you one. The 'Muddy Waters' is my personal favorite.
Good spot to go to if you're in the area and want to satisfy your Malaysian food cravings. I wouldn't say this is the best Malaysian spot I've been to though. The staff here is always great. Super friendly and attentive. As for the food I ordered the roti canai, hainanese chicken with chicken rice, and hokkien meen, all to share! The roti canai was good, but when it arrived it was cold (both the curry sauce and bread) which obviously makes it not as good. The chicken was yummy, but the rice was a little bland and lacking the chicken taste. Lastly the hokkien meen which is stir fried egg noodles with shrimp, chicken, and squid (?), that was actually the best one out of the 3! The portion was also very good. Overall, I recommend this spot for a quick fix and if you're feeling Malaysian. I actually never come here as this isn't one of my go-to spots in Chinatown, but it does the job when you need it to.
"This review is strictly for the girl behind the to-go counter who decided to ruin the good vibes as we were leaving. My sister, mom and I came here for Mother's Day with my niece who's almost 2. She freaked out when my sister went to the bathroom because you know she loves my sister. Anyways, I was really feeling the music and one of the guys suggested to come back during a specific night. People were saying thank you, see you soon, come back again and this girl decides to yell out ""Don't come back again!"" If my niece and other kids weren't there words would have been had with this rude staff member. If you hate your job fine, don't work in the service industry. If you hate kids, go work at an old people's home. Don't worry, I won't be coming back thanks!"
Came with friends because the capri-sun drinks got our attention. The wait wasn't long on a Friday night (maybe because it was still early). They have a policy of ordering one dish per person. Food took a while to come and every dish came one after the other. We ordered the tuna tataki, which consisted on 5 pieces of thinly sliced seared tuna. We also had the korean seafood pancake, the crispy chicken (salty) and the truffle mac and cheese. This last dish was good. Overall, dishes were okay tasting but all of them were small. Ah, and by the way the drinks aren't that great, it was just the looks.  The bill came out to $105 for 4 drinks and 4 dishes. I was ready to give them 3 stars, but they had to top it with a  cherry. After we paid with cash, the waitress took all the cash and asked if we needed the change. We said no and she proceeded to take all the cash in front of us, separated the money and counted it out loud on our faces. We never felt so insulted in our lives (Trust me, we wouldn't give you extra and if something was missing you could've always came to us. We weren't going to run away).  Overall, service was horrible, food was pricey and not worth it and all my friends agreed that we were never coming back.
Super disappointing! Some friends and I came here for lunch on Monday, and left very unsatisfied. Two of us had the wild shrimp salad, and found the dressing to lack any seasoning or flavor. The texture of the shrimp was also extremely chewy. My other friend got the soup (chestnut that day), and the salmon sandwich. She said the soup was watery, and the sandwich mediocre.  It's possible we went on an off-day, but would definitely not try it again. That being said, the restaurant is pretty and the service was fine.
The food here is so good! It is a little bizarre that such a nice restaurant is cash only, but I guess it works for them. AlMar has a rustic feel with heavy wood tables (both two-person and long cafeteria-style) and industrial lighting, and floor-to-ceiling windows so I'll bet a ton of light comes through during the day. I came here for dinner though, so it was more dim and mood lighting-y. I only got one dish here, the sauteed calf livers ($18) but it was sooo good. The texture was just right, the balsamic vinegar and onions complemented the richness of the liver, and the mashed potatoes were creamy and offset the liver very well. I'm definitely coming back to try their other dishes.
I had  the hot chicken. Do not be dismayed, if you get the chicken hot, it is hot even if it doesnt look like it. The fried chicken was soo juicy,crunchy with the perfect amount of salt. The grits were smooth but I felt like it needed a bit of nutmeg or pepper. Wait time was 15-20 minutes since we ended up sitting at the bar area.  The ambiance is pretty chill,prices are reasonable/ on the cheaper side  for brunch.  In all, I would definitely go back again. The food is delicious.
"Came to this place with my husband on a Saturday evening to try out the food, curious to see and know why this place gets so many good reviews. It is a really small and tight place. For a table for two, you can only fit a maximum of 3 plates. We ordered the following: 1) Roast Pork - Caribbean style citrus marinated roast pork served with yellow rice and black beans. We kind of regretted ordering this because the meat was dry. 2) Cuban Sandwich - (Voted best in NYC) Citrus marinated roast pork, ham, Swiss cheese, chipotle mayonnaise and pickle, on toasted roll with fresh hand cut French fries. Perhaps we are just not fans of sandwiches, we felt it was just ""meh"", nothing really stands out about it. 3) Tostones. I loved this! The sauce that they came with really goes well with the tostones. I don't mind having double portion of these! 4) Grilled Corn Mexican Style - Served with mayonnaise, cotija cheese, chili powder and lime. One word, delicious! Don't mind going back for more of these corns! Overall, due to the really small and tight place, accompanied by the below average service, most probably would only go back for the Mexican grilled corns!"
Had dinner here, food was fine but nothing special. Service started off well but floundered by the end. We ordered wine before our entrees arrived and received them when we were almost done eating despite the place not being that busy. Also, when they were clearing the table one of the staff was careless and dropped a knife with food on it onto my shirt. Mistakes happen but nobody even tried to do anything about it or apologize. Maybe bring a glass of club soda or even take off a glass of wine on the house. It was very odd and not hospitable. Not an enjoyable experience for the price.
This place is tiny but charming. The website makes it look big but it's super small. There is no waiter/waitress service which is just a deal breaker. Having to fight through the tiny place tripping over other tables, down the stairs to the bar to order a round of drinks and/or your food and then back again is ridiculous. If ya wanna act like a dive bar then charge dive bar prices otherwise, come on! Hire a waitress.  Not going back.
Is it me or is this place a Bucca di Beppo in disguise? Food was okay but it's New York and amazing Italian food is available everywhere. You order off of a board on the wall just like BdB, portions are huge just like BdB. I feel like I made a bad choice.
Peter Luger definitely does the steaks right. The dry aged porterhouse is always the way to go.  The service could be on and off though. The cheese cake is definitely rich and Schlag is a huge plus.
"I had this place bookmarked for so long bc of the ""date night"" decor and ambiance and finally got to visit here with my cousins, friends and bf. I love how the fancy gold details made us feel like royalty, especially when sitting in the canopy booths. Because of our large group, I wanted to call ahead to make reservations but they only do walk in reservations on fridays and saturdays (day we went). I had a friend who was already in the city sit around there an hr ahead while we were in transit from BK. Expect a long wait for big groups. ORDER Complimentary appetizer: something with beef? Kinda had a sweet taste to it which I liked. Not sure bc place was loud and packed, so couldn't hear the waiter. My cousins couldn't try it out bc they're vegetarian. Red curry tofu: super delicious with lots of flavor without putting my tongue on fire. Really filling. Pad kee mao: cousins ordered the veggie option, while bf ordered the chicken option. Chicken was super tender. Plating was a bit off putting, but don't be fooled by the portion bc it fills you up. Krapaw gai sub: friend ordered this and loved it, saying that it reminded her of burmese food. Fried egg was an added bonus as well. Kaeng chapoo phu: crab entree on the special dinner menu. Friend wanted to splurge a bit to celebrate. It was tasty, but not worth the price. Overall, this place is awesome for the food, ambience, and service. Special dinner menu is a bit pricey, but the entrees are super affordable. My cousins and boyfriend enjoyed some drinks as well. Our waiter was attentive and checked in on us throughout the night refilling our drinks as needed. I'd love to come back for lunch one day."
Front door very racist and discriminating...waited 1 hour second on the line but after he let 30 people i told him why and he started pushing....manners come with culture stay away
I've decided to give this place a 3rd chance since the food is really good but man oh man, be prepared to wait twice as long for anything here. I'm in here now and have been waiting for my food for about 45 minutes. Being on how long this place has been opened I'm kind of surprised how clueless everyone seems to be. So if you want Filipino food, go to the one next door. It's a smaller place and service is definitely much faster.
I usually do not give five stars to places because I'm a snob and nothing is ever good enough for me. However, Uva takes the cake here. Hands down. I may have to say that out of all the restaurants in NYC, this may be my favorite restaurant and Italian food is not my favorite type of cuisine for the record. I have never, ever been disappointed with any of their dishes. They are open late and this is a huge plus especially in the UES. Perfect spot for a night cap, a date or a simple dinner.  All their pastas here are made in house and it makes every pasta dish I've had a delight to try regardless of their toppings or pairings.The pesto pasta dish is my absolute favorite! Perfect amount of pesto and the pasta is light and flavorful. Their gnocchis are little balls of cotton in your mouth with the perfect amount of cheese and saltiness. Ugh. My mouth is salivating just thinking about it.  Their crostinis are delicious but I may be biased here because I love any and all crostinis.  For the cheese and wine lovers like myself. Surprisingly, their cheese selections are also a great combo!! Just ask the waiter/waitress to surprise you with the best cheeses they have currently. You will not be disappointed. Their wine list selection is extensive and I'm sure will never disappoint you either.  I'm a vegetarian but every time I come here I have to have some of their lamb meatballs. They are absolutely delicious. Every person who has ever tried them has also agreed with me. My mother who is an extremely picky eater and to everyone's surprise dislikes Italian food, could not stop munching on these either. Must try!  The deserts are also a great ending and a must try.  Basically, everything here is spot on. Don't bother being picky, just select anything on the menu and enjoy! I myself cannot wait to go back. See you soon Uva.
Margaritas to die for!  Beautiful outdoor seating.. and they focus on sustainability! It's a great place to head to for people to that do not know the area well. It's hard to miss!  Super trendy and something everyone can enjoy!
I mean...I dunno. Finding exemplary Mexican fare in this city is much like finding good Indian food--it's pretty difficult, there is a lot of rif-raf to sort through, and ultimately, the best place to go is probably some hole-in-the-wall off of the 7 train in Queens.  Mesa Coyoacan feels a little like one of those (expensive) distractions on the way to the  cheaper real deal. I was a little let-down, but mostly because I made the mistake of reading all the hype about this place before I ended up dining here. If you don't read the reviews--the ones where Mesa is regarded as one of the best spots to try in Williamsburg; the nod from the Michelin guide--and you just go here without expectation, you will have a pleasant dining experience. The service is wonderful. The margaritas are strong. The atmosphere is trendy, clean, and modern. The food is fine.  But I can't elevate my review beyond that. I wanted it to be excellent and it is possible that there is something on the menu that shines that I might have just missed. It's definitely worth exploring. I would say don't order the tacos. They are fine and you will leave satisfied, but I have a feeling the kitchen shines through on the dishes that require a little more care and construction.
We walked in on a Sunday night without a reservation and waited about 30 min for 2 seats to open up at the bar. The host was very feisty and was trying to convince us to leave (odd right?) but I was pretty determined to get a seat here after hearing from a couple of friends about how good the food was.  I was actually really glad we got seats at the bar because we were able to converse with the bartender who gave us wonderful wine and food recommendations.  Scallops with black truffle- The best dish of the night! I was blown away. The scallops tasted fresh and were cooked to perfection. They were tender and delicious.  Beef carpaccio with black truffle- obviously I love truffle. The beef carpaccio was thinly sliced and was a great appetizer.  Clam linguine- a classic that couldn't have been better. They also split the dish for us because we were sharing. I love when restaurants do that for you! Poppy seed lemon meringue- I couldn't leave without getting dessert and I was really glad I did. It was the perfect amount of sweetness.  Our bill came out to $153 including 2 glasses of wine. I think it's reasonably priced for how good the food is. Can't wait to come back.
Weird name, good food. Love to bring friends and family here for a good introduction to thai!
My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed Pies-n-Thighs, it was possibly the best fried chicken I've had in NYC. WAIT: Came on a Saturday around 11:30 am and the wait for 2 people was 30-40 minutes.  Total we waited 35 minutes. You put your name down and wait to be called. ATMOSPHERE: When you first walk in, there's no hostess area so it might be hard to find who to give your name to.  I just walked to the kitchen and hoped someone would acknowledge me.  The inside looks really small but dont be discouraged because there is a whole room in the back with more tables.  The kitchen is open and bustling with pies on display and orders being carted to and from tables.  Overall, a homey feel in the front with a more farm/basement/brick feel in the back room. FOOD: We knew we had to try the fried chicken, biscuits, and waffles. CHICKEN BOX - it comes with 3 pieces of fried chicken, a biscuit and choice of side.  Perfect for someone looking to try both the chicken and the biscuit.  I got a green/side salad which was surprisingly good.  Refreshing and a light but tasty dressing.  I asked for all dark meat and got 2 thighs and 1 drumstick.  The batter is crunchy and crispy like Popeyes, it's a little on the thin side so there's not much of the actual batter but I didnt mind that much.  The chicken itself was so flavorful and juicy, definitely very good quality chicken.  Flavor wise it wasn't overpowering with a lot of seasoning but just had a good natural, fried chicken taste.  The biscuit was pretty thick, crispy on the outside with a bit of a crunch and soft layers of buttery biscuit on the inside.  Very good, not too drying and not overly salty.  The table has honey you can put on it as well. CHICKEN AND WAFFLES - chicken was good just as above (only 2 pieces) but the waffles were only OK.  Granted, they are buckwheat waffles so the batter is different but they just tasted soggy/doughy and not crispy at all.  The cinnamon butter was very good though.  Next time I would suggest just going with the chicken box unless you really enjoy buckwheat waffles. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to try, despite the wait it is worth it!
When we walked in, Wednesday night at 6:30/7 it was empty. But we made a reservation to be safe. By the time we left around 9 there was not an empty table in sight. I got the Amazing Cauliflower and the Spaghetti & Meatballs (Wednesday night meal) & BOY. This food was incredible. They pour big glasses of wine here too! I do have to say, I think they were short staffed. There was maybe 1 waiter for the entire place & 2 bus-boys. It took a long time, but good food & conversation--I cannot complain! Would 100% come back for a date night or group with friends. Such a cozy atmosphere too.
Solid Japanese comfort food. I ordered the katsudon and my friend got the unagidon. Both were good and surprisingly filling. Flavor profile is definitely on the sweet side, but I think this is true for a lot of Japanese food, and I personally didn't mind.
The cheap people here charge fifty cents for just spicy sauce.  Even for soy sauce they wanted to charge additional money.  The food was okay, overrated and over priced
Meh. Its ok - not bad, but was expecting more from the 4 star review from yelp. I am a big fan of Japanese izakaya style restaurants. I was excited to see skewers and traditional dons on the menu. Mediocre food and overcrowded ambiance didn't really impress me all that much :/  Tried the chicken breast, skin skewer - nothing special here. Also tried the salmon donburi that was a bit dry and not much flavor.  Service was attentive but they were very busy and the whole restaurant was too crowded.
Solid bar, good space and good drinks. Nice beer selection and the wings were surprisingly good. Service was better than I expected for a Wednesday at midnight.
This place is awesome! Authentic Thai food and very tasty. If you like spicy, try the Laab  Ped Udon. The scor is pretty cool too, with abstract paintings from local Thai artists.
I went on a Monday night around 9pm with a group of 4, they didn't have a table for all of us and we didn't mind splitting so we waited ~10 minutes and 2 of us sat at the bar and my other 2 friends got sat in the middle after ~20 minutes. Service was fine, waitress was friendly. Ambiance was very hip and romantic/homey. I got their mu ramen. Their broth is really good and rich. It's very uniform and consistent, unlike zundo ya or ippudo, which has some thicker broth towards the bottom. Their noodles are good, the mu ramen bowl comes with thick wavy ramen, but I think the other bowls have thin straight. Instead of pork, it comes with corned beef which is a very weird combination and does not go well with the broth but I'm not picky, ramen is mainly about the broth anyways. The beef is not fat like the ones at ippudo or zundo ya that melt in your mouth. Instead it's very meaty and lean.
It's just awesome, the foods are amazing, also the drinks. Please try their curry vegetables and coconut pudding!
I liked this place! It was pretty busy around 8:30 PM. Got a table. Our waiter was super friendly and nice. We both got tacos and they were okay. I had a hard time eating them because they were tiny shells, piled high with meat. The flavors were good though, and everything was fresh. They a lot of drink options, too. I would go back.
After searching a lot for a good japanese place, came across this one. Ordered tempura roll ( which were the worst-1/5) , volcano sushi ( 4/5) , beef(4/5) and fried eel (4/5).  Green tea ice cream tasted just not like cafe ziya but different a little bitter.  The worst part was the wait time. We were told the wait time would be around 40 minutes but it took about 1 hour to get seated. Mind you, its in the basement so gets really noisy and claustrophobic after a bit. We couldn't enjoy the meal as the whole restaurant was too noisy. Also had to ask the server to fill the water glass.
Noodles been fine the last few times I ordered, but today was just soggy, there's no excuse if you're selling fresh noodles for it to end up looking and tasting like broken soggy noodles when I'm a 5 minute walk from my office.
"My favorite neighborhood restaurant.....(30 years in Bed Stuy!) located right around the corner from my house.  Employees are like family, love them all. Food is delish, drinks are superb! Love the sister Rosetta and sippie Wallace :)   Those who complain about this establishment need to stay home, or stop venturing to Bed Stuy just because you heard of a ""new spot"" read page 160 on zagat or a review floating around social media. *straight face* This cute, snug spot doesn't have the capacity to accomodate naysayers."
Brooklyn used to be a lot different before all the white girls took over. Brooklyn was once a rough place to be. With this change, Chavela's moved in in 2007. So we're strolling through the Brooklyn Botanical Gardens, admiring the bonsai trees, rekindling our former interests in botany and plant physiology (the effect of iron on the primary root elongation of Arabidopsis during phosphate deficiency), then all of a sudden two of our friends are really worried because we need to walk faster, hurry up, we can't waste time, we have to leave this dank botanical place ASAP so that we can get some overrated Mexican food by 12pm so that we can catch our Megabus. Y'all need to chill. The food is overhyped. Anyone from San Diego or Mexico need not come here. I ordered the huevos rancheros. It just didn't taste good. The kicker is that two of our friends liked the food here more than that of Sarge's Jewish deli. God damn they are schmacked. This place is really popular. Packed on a Sunday morning. I don't have any suggestions in terms of how this restaurant can improve.
This place has incredible beers on draft, a great food menu, and a staff that is both friendly and knowledgeable. They also have a full fridge stocked with unique cans and bottles that you can pick up and go home with. The pricing is fair and the atmosphere is very welcoming. If you're a craft beer lover, this place is a must! Feel free to talk to Oliver behind the bar. He'll be your new best friend.
Great place! Came here with my date late night. Realized all our other spots were closed, so I dragged us here haha. Glad I did! We were both craving soup dumplings and got two orders of different soup dumplings off the menu. Split an order of beef fried rice because we saw the photos of plates and it looked huge. Glad we split it because we could barely finish. Dinner for two with tip came out to $30 which was amazing. Be aware, they only accept card when your total is over $25. Great for a late night, and kind service!
I loved everything about Glasserie accept for one MAJOR PROBLEM. They leave all the silverware out on the table in a jar for the prior dinners to touch, breathe and sneeze on. .GROSS. I am surprised they haven't received a health code violation for this. I haven't been back to eat there only because of this. It is SO unsanitary.  Glasserie please fix this so we can enjoy the wonderful food and atmosphere again
Went to the boil but didn't get to sit down due to the long wait list at 10pm.  Ended up taking my food to go, after faking an hour to get there. Food was tasty, but may not take that trip again. The spot is located across a park on a busy corner, with garbage bags on the curb that I had to stand next to waiting to be called. The ambience is nothing to write home about.
I finally was able to try the famous Bo Ssam dinner and it was amazing!  I hadn't ever been able to order it because I never had enough people to join me. I was able to find a group of people to share it with through   When they brought the bo Ssam out we were blown away by the size. No wonder why you need 6-10 to book it with. It's a feast! We all left stuffed and loved every bite. About the dinner, Ssäm is Korean for enclosed or wrapped! The pork shoulder was cured overnight, then slow roasted for 6-8 hours before being glazed in brown sugar and its roasting juices.  The Dinner includes the whole  slow-cooked pork shoulder, a dozen oysters, and two bowls each of white rice, bibb lettuce, Korean-style barbecue sauce, kimchi and ginger scallion sauce.
It's a very great atmosphere restaurant here, all the decoration on the wall and the ceiling were interesting.  We ordered the Pork Benedict, and the crab cake on the side, also we ordered the jambalaya since many reviews recommended. The pork Benedict was great, very delicious. The crab cake is okay, tasted like frozen not fresh cook. Jambalaya was good though, I like it how it came with mild spicy flavor.  I'm definitely come back here.
Mediocre, overhyped food. The ambience was nice but the food was oily and tasteless.
Walked in and the hostess looked confused. We asked for a seat for two. She walked us to one table then asked us to wait while she cleaned the table. She cleaned the table then walked us upstairs to a different table. Not a big deal but was just a weird experience. They have a good tap list. Food was tasty too. It came out pretty quick. One issue was the tables are really small. The plates with drinks barely fit on the table.
The east coast version of Cali's Roscoes Chicken and Waffle. They have a bacon and cheddar waffle that's very delicious. It's def a must try when visiting this place.  If you're ever in the Williamsburg area of Brooklyn.  This is def a place you need to go for some fire fried chicken.  Bam!!!  4 stars.
I have been wanting to try Thursday Kitchen for a while now so when my friend asked if I could do dinner on a weekday, I immediately suggested Thursday Kitchen. I was hoping that we would be able to quickly get a table later on a Tuesday night, but I was wrong. The place was packed, with people still waiting. The host quoted us a 30 minute wait time and he was accurate. Note that they won't even bother seating you unless your full party is there. They will text you when your table is available so at least that gives you the flexibility to walk around instead of staying at the restaurant. Onto the food! Their concept is Korean-inspired small plates. They suggest you order two dishes per person. I came with three other people and only five dishes caught our eye so that's what we went with. We ordered the following: -Angry potatoes: I would skip this. While the potatoes are nice and crispy, they're nothing special. It's literally just homefries topped with BBQ sauce and feta.  -Truffle mac & cheese: One of the better dishes of the night! Very creamy, rich, and cheesy. Must get if you like truffle oil! -Kimchi paella: Decent but didn't wow me. The dish seemed like more white onions than rice.  -Steak: The best dish of the night! The skirt steak was perfectly cooked and the grits were fantastic! Everything in this dish was flavorful and well seasoned. I could have eaten two of these and called it a night!  -Korean popcorn chicken: Solid. Basically like the spicy sauce used in Korean fried chicken but coated around pieces of fried boneless chicken instead of wings.  All the dishes range from $8-13. The dishes, in general, were pretty good. While some were better than others, they were all tasty. One thing that put a damper on our dining experience was the timing of the food. With small plates, we expected to enjoy them together. However, the dishes were brought out one at a time. We would finish one and then the next one would arrive. If I could make a suggestion to them, it would to be more mindful of timing.  Overall, Thursday Kitchen is great place to catch up with friends over shared small plates. While the space holds a decent number of tables, they are all 2-4 seaters. We didn't feel like drinking that night, but the glowing adult capri suns caught my eye. I'll have to give them a try the next time I'm here.
$6 for a Martini?!  In the city?! Until 10pm?! Why wouldn't you check it out! Unfortunately, their infamous lychee Martini fell short for me. It lacked sweetness and was too dry. I feel lychee martinis usually have a good balance of both.  As for the food, I got two out of the three top recommended apps...fried ginger chicken wings and chicken dumplings. Both were over fried and tasteless. The honey soy dipping sauce for the wings was straight up soy sauce. Let's just say even between two of us, there was still leftovers. The restaurant itself is in a great location, right smack in the middle of it all. The restaurant has a lounge, dark and intimate feel to it. Tables are a little too close for my taste. Our waitress was attentive though and checked on us a few times. Overall, I won't be retiring. In fact, We didn't stay past 30 minutes before moving onto a new spot.
"God the food is great at this place. The hand pulled noodles are some of the best I have ever eaten, while the lamb and spicy sauce in my cumin lamb noodles were ""plate-licking"" delicious. Probably the best noodle house I have ever eaten at. But I can only give it 4 stars because of the ""ambiance,"" or lack thereof. There is only tightly packed counter space for eating, and that is invariably a liquid mess from the previous occupants slurping and spilling. The flimsy napkins, paper plates, and plastic utensils also add to the low rent feel. This is definitely not a place to take a date, a parent, or a business associate. Given the five star quality of the food and the long lines of people waiting to place an order, I would think that tables, chairs, and real utensils would be an appropriate upgrade."
If you want to add tip, which is totally fine, please remind us. So customer won't confuse and tip again. The most dishonest thing is you add tip without reminding customers you've done so. It is a gesture of dishonesty. Very very bad.
TLDR: Tuna tar guac, bottomless drinks, great service. What more can I ask for? We came here for bottomless mimosas and brunch while visiting New York for a weekend. We had made a reservation, and were seated immediately. For $45 for unlimited food and alcohol, this was a no-brained.  Pear salad: a refreshing, fresh mix of sweet pear and arugula. This was a favorite of mine as a buffer for the heavier breakfast foods.  Spaghetti and eggs: we tried to order this three times, and it only came out once. It is baked in a skillet so it does take time...but it was less weird than the combination I expected. It was not as exciting as I wanted, but definitely worth a try.  Breakfast potatoes: pretty standard.  Pork shoulder: the pork fell off the bone and was extremely tender. I wasn't too crazy about the sauce though.  Brioche French toast: I'm not a big fan of French toast, but this is also a MUST try. The french toast is golden and perfectly crispy balanced with Nutella, bananas, and strawberries. Sautéed asparagus: A nice buffer dish for the heavier foods. The asparagus were massive and came with delicious oyster mushrooms. (I ate three orders of these.) Smoked salmon: Pretty standard, but I wasn't a huge fan of the added honey.  House ricotta: the cheese and honey were delicious, but the bread it came with left something to be desired.  Baked scrambled eggs: pretty standard scrambled eggs.  Kale Caesar: a nice refreshing veggie palate cleanser.  Tuna tar guac: BY FAR my favorite dish. The tuna tar was delicious with a nice blend with the guacamole on strange green chips. Even if you do not like raw fish, I beg you to try this! Blushing mimosa: delicious and light, perfect to pair with brunch! Overall, this was a great deal for the amount of food and drinks that we consumed. The service was very attentive, and the food all came out relatively quickly. The decor and ambience were on point, with live jazz that played later in the day. Places like these almost make me want to move to NY. I'll be back!
I came from Chicago and browsed some websites to find recommendations of the best cheap eats in the city, and this place popped up. I don't know if it's because Chicago has way better ramen, but this place was really below average. I think I got the tonkatsu and shoyu tonkatsu ramen bowls. It was lukewarm, underseasoned, bland ramen that was lacking in meat, veggies, or anything else. I'm quite disappointed. In terms of service, they were pretty fast and friendly. There isn't enough seating, so we were lucky that we got there right after they opened. By the time we left, people were standing around waiting to snatch our seats.
Amazing food ,great tastes, great choices, only reason I didn't give this place a 5 star is because of the employe at the cashier , she scoffed at me when I didn't give a tip and threw my debit card at me with disgust ,upon asking for a to go container she rolled her eyes at me and pointed at the foil paper available. She was extremely nasty and unprofessional. If I ever come I will not deal with her again I would rather walk out and come back when she's not there ,I wish my experience was better. But great food , i can't take that away from this place.
It was late so there was no vibe to thrive off of. The bartender was snippy and slightly rude to my friend. We ordered the wings- hot, but they were mild and the calamari was undercooked so we had them re-fry it. It was delicious once they did. The prices are decent and it's one of the cleaner bars in the hood, but it didn't sell me.
Came here for midweek dinner with a friend. We ordered the  pork belly buns, Peking duck tacos, beef ramen, charshu pork ramen, and hot sake.  Pork belly buns- amazing pork and stale/hard lackluster buns. These buns were definitely store-bought and had an unwanted crunch to them. Peking duck tacos- amazing! To be honest I really wanted an entire plate of the duck Beef bone ramen- delicious, tender, succulent beef. Charshu ramen- didn't like. This dish came with a sliver of pork on a bed of cold noodles and green that you're supposed to dip in the broth served in a separate bowl. I love charshu and was totally disappointed. The broth was basically salted pork and chicken bouillon. Pass on this one.
I LOVE YOU SOCO! We went hungry -- we left buzzed and stuffed with food to take home. A night to put in the books for sure. We ordered lots of food here, but I stilled wish we could have tried everything off their menu!! Everything was so flavorful, no items were the same as the other. There were two large groups dining while we were there. The staff was fun, and very nice. The music was sooooo good!  If I could go back in time and recreate how awesome this experience was.. I would in a heartbeat!
"Nothing they serve here is good enough to warrant the terrible service. Reserved a table, showed up and they said they didn't have a table and instead sat us at the ""chef's bar"", aka in front of a 400 degree oven with 5 guys running around frantically preparing food. Exactly the kind of romantic, relaxed atmosphere you want after a day's work. This neighborhood deserves better than bait & switchers. Don't support this garbage."
Food is good but service is crap.   They started sweeping all over like they're closing soon but it's not even last seating time for brunch.( Plus they do dinner which is right after)    The server who is sweeping the floor then went on serving orders from the kitchen even without washing her hands.    Lost my appetite after that
"Super disappointed in my second trip to Fornino. My boyfriend and I raved about this place in the past and decided to return with both our moms. We ordered inside, got a number, and grabbed a table outside. We waited. And waited. And continued to wait. No pizza. Meanwhile new patrons around us were receiving their food even though arriving much later than us.  Eventually we went inside and asked what was going on. The staff had no idea what to do and seemed completely confused. Finally they found a manager who came over to our table. No apology. He just simply said, ""We looked for you upstairs."" We found this ridiculous considering we were told we could sit anywhere - up or down.  Our pizza arrived five minutes later. And to make it all even better-2 of the 3 pizzas were ice cold, clearly having sat somewhere for quite awhile. They didn't have the courtesy to even warm them back up. And they didn't give us a discount on our bill. Terrible customer service."
HOLY CRAP. Who is rating this? Who are these people? Do they have no taste buds? I don't know. It's all a mystery.  I went here for a work dinner so we were free to get almost anything/ no budget limit.  First, there were barely any people when we went which tells you a lot about this place. The only other customers were seated at the bar getting drinks.  Then, the menu comes out and its basically ALL PIZZA. The menu is divided into three - drinks, pizza and other dishes. So almost all of us ordered the pizza. It was bad. Like maybe even worse than Domino's pizza. Cheese was rubbery w no flavor, pizza types were really limited. So disappointed.  TLDR: They only have pizza, pizza is bad, no other tables except for us
Ate here recently. The food was good, but the portions were small, and the pasta dishes were not served with any bread. The waiter was not particularly friendly. Will not eat here again.
Great ambiance and decoration but very very busy at all times.  As many others shared in their reviews its tough to get a proper table here so were seated at the high stools and served dinner which was ok since we didn't want to wait an hour for a table. started off with great wine and cheese then we ordered the Kale salad which was a good start it had a nice citrusy flavor, then the sea bass was my entree and that was delicious!  They have a great decoration and a fantastic chef but I am not a huge fan of the service and overcrowded loud space.
Came for their number 1 Banh Mi special sandwich. The sandwich was ok- flavor was lacking for a Banh mi. Joju is a good attempt at Banh Mi sandwiches and is one of the few in Queens. I give them props for trying. I would recommend however they get better bread - this will improve their sandwiches big time.
For a new restaurant with ample real estate, seating was cramped. Bistro style is but patrons' comfort is not the priority here.  Started off with the mousse de fois grois which was Hudson Valley fois grois well paired with onion compote & red wine port sauce. Then it was a steady decline from there.  Main entree was the Cote De Veau Aux Champignons - 16oz grass fed veal porterhouse, enochi mushrooms, sweetbreads & veal jus. This was an extremely fatty dish... cut was 70% fat, 20% bone, 10% meat. Best part of dish was the sauce. One of the few establishments to serve a veal porterhouse and doing a very poor job at it. Also tried the Fletan Poele - seared halibut, roasted parsnips, haricot vert & carrot purée. The fish was seared and drenched in the puree which created a soggy texture. The parsnips were the best part of the dish as it was finally a solid bite of the evening. The legumes tagine was comforting. Slow-cooked vegetables with ras el hanout and couscous. The ras el hanout added very nice flavor to the dish although the dish was more brothy and soup-like than I had expected. I enjoyed the dish by combining the tagine with the couscous and and the sauce from the veal dish. For dessert, I prayed the Mousse Au Chocolat would blow me away. Alas it did not. Did they forget the sugar? It looks like mousse and it looks like chocolate, but it did not taste like chocolate mousse. I saved room for dessert and was not satisfied. Thank goodness the company I was with saved the evening. The staff in general was attentive in refilling water glasses although not in clearing the tiny tables when we were done with dishes (and waiting for additional dishes). I am surprised by the lack of experience, attention, and service in arranging the table appropriately for the number of people and dishes that were to be placed on the table. Additionally, because the space between parties is almost non-existent, the waitress, Diana S, placed a glass of wine on the edge of the table. She couldn't even walk to the table - she extended her arm from another table and served the wine from behind my friend who'd ordered it. Not only was that move a hazard as the glass could've dropped, but it demonstrated lack of care in providing service. We overlooked questions not getting answered (I don't think she understands the word 'special' 'favorite' and 'popular' when we had asked about the menu). We overlooked forgetful/delayed service when asking for lemon wedges, bread, and a 2nd glass of wine. But the neglect in trying to accommodate is a problem. I hope improvements are made to the space and service.
"I came here with a bunch of professional colleagues for a fun, networking dinner. The first thing out of the waiter's mouth was a fairly rude""You know this is family style, right?""   He could have said ""Generally for groups of 10 or more, we do family style. Is that okay? Do you have any questions?"" Instead he was talking to us as though he was already put on upon. It only got worse from there. I responded because I'm a vegetarian and family style generally doesn't work for me, but he said he could do something special for the vegetarians (there were two of us). But then he turned  to other people at the table and said, ""Vegetarians don't eat anything! They only eat pasta!"" making fun of me. Making fun of my life choices is, unfortunately, a weird, yet common response. I didn't judge his choices, but felt it was okay to judge mine and mock them to other people at our table. Finally, to top it all off, he didn't do anything special for us veggies, he just made sure one of the family style options  was vegetarian. Meaning that I would get 1/12 of a portion, which is not a meal, and have to pay for everyone else's meat options, even though I didn't eat them. The waiter, who was the opposite of accommodating, played dumb, and was super rude about it when I tried explaining that this wouldn't be enough food. I decided to leave because it had already been two hours, i had been insulted twice, and I wanted to eat a full meal, so I opted out of the dinner, which was a good choice because the other women who ate the veggie option said it has pancetta in it.  For the record, I'm very respectful of other people's choices as far as what they want to eat, I don't make a big deal about my veggie choices. I'm not a loud vegetarian. I do expect that when I go to a restaurant to not be mocked and to have food to eat. Its a pretty low bar and this place couldn't meet it."
I ordered the spicy pork ramen Tasted mediocre and not spice at all! My friend ordered a vegetable Ramen he asked for some chilly sauce he got very small amount  and my amazement they charged $1.50 for it. unacceptable
despicable service.SERVER WAS A SHORT GIRL WITH BLOND HAIR IN A PONY TAIL. AVOID HER. SHE IS SLOW AND GETS ORDERS WRONG. ASK TO SWITCH AWAY FROM HER TABLE. INCOMPETENCE. ordered 2 cold soba and a chicken karage appetizer.  chicken came out. it was ok. small pieces of fried chicken. for $8. nothing special at a new York price. then the ramens started coming out...all around us. ppl who we sat down next to at the same time got their noodles. but not ours. tables that came after us. like 10 minutes after us got their food. and more came out....all around us. tables outside...which were empty when we got in had their food. and it was the SAME FOOD WE HAD ORDERED. no explanation, no apology. then our noodles came out. wrong ORDER. when we asked what had happened server said it was different noodles. they were the SAME as what we had ordered. at least tried to. walked out. again, no apology, no explanation from the restaurant. I don't expect the world when I dine out. I expect food to come out when it does (time ranges for different reaturants), in the order it was ordered in. if something gets mixed up, an explanation is fine. it's when there is no explanation and no apology that it becomes unacceptable. this place is unacceptable. I've been here before, service is always slow, food is mediocre, basically good enough to eat. if you want actually good food, ippudo and many many many other places are way better. only came.cause it was close by and we were hungry.  not making that mistake again. INCOMPETENT.
"Such a shame.  Food was really excellent: zucchini pancake and octopus were some of the best we've had anywhere (including pricier neighborhood spots). The service, however, was just so disappointing. The people who sat next to us a good ten minutes after we arrived ordered the same thing we did and got served way before we did. When we asked where our food was they looked like we were crazy for asking, then shuffled around and found it. And OUR lamb shank was cold -- like they had to rush to get it to us. No apologies-- just kept saying ""but yours is coming right out!"" No apologies, no offer of dessert or SOMETHING to make up for feeling seriously dissed by them. I love Good Turkish food but maybe this is why this place isn't busier."
While I'm still a huge fan of dinner here, and want to remain the biggest fan of their lunch deals, I'm here to make a complaint - with a party of 4, we were exactly numbers 16-20. They only have 20 bara chirashis available a day. Now, we sat down, waited for our hot towels to come, and immediately requested 4 bara chirashis. There was only one left. Excuse me?  Why don't you actually ask people as they get seated whether they're going for the most popular deal so that it's fair? People who come in first should be given the opportunity to snatch the deal first. It's just not right that it's the luck of the draw. I'm not increasing my stars back until that gets fixed, since the lunch deals is really all soba totto is good for. Also - people.. please stop being jerks by having one person wait in line for a group of 10 showing up the minute doors open.
I came here on a weeknight and shared the calamari salad, bibimbap, ginger salmon, and creme brulee. The portions were generous and waiters were attentive. Calamari salad: flavorful, but not overly dressed  Bibimbap: standard, but good  Ginger salmon: perfectly cooked and the corn pudding was delicious  Creme Brûlée: The red bean was delicious and overly sweet. However, the green tea had too much matcha and the yuzu fruit was too sweet.  I will definitely come back to try the burgers and tartare.
It's okay not the greatest. We didn't get to try the lamb that everybody raves about but we tried everything else. The Dino ribs plus reg ribs. Pulled pork, along with briskets. Briskets and ribs were the best but too greasy to finish all. Was getting nauseated toward the end and couldn't finish it. It's not the food is bad but maybe haven't have that much of meat in awhile.
We came by at 9:40pm to have dinner and the 2 hostess said they were done serving food. Yelp says they close at 10. Was very disappointed have been really wanting to eat here and it's my only night off this week. Such a shame
Be prepared to wait,this place has great southern cuisine and there is always a line to get in.Parking is not good but there are 2 buses that stop a block away.The food is worth the wait.
Inefficient. Overhyped. Disappointing.  I was very unimpressed. I went to their grand opening for the buy 1 get 1 free promotion and boy, was it disappointing. Not only did they not open on time but the customer service was horrendous.  I was there at 11AM and 4th in line. Ordered green tea waffles with mochi filling and condensed milk, mochi and strawberries as toppings. People behind me started getting their orders. I waited 45 minutes. and got annoyed and went to the desk to ask.  Turns out they didn't have matcha batter but they didn't bother telling the people who ordered matcha. When I asked, they said 20 minutes more before they could make matcha waffles.  Waited the 20 minutes and still no waffle. I went to the front again and they refunded my money and changed my order to plain waffles as compensation. But, I had to wait another half an hour before I got my waffle. So there was really no point to coming to line up early in freezing weather... When I got the waffle, it was very average. I would not pay the 8+ dollars for it. It just tasted like the ones you get on the streets with a dollop of ice cream.
I've only ever been to the pop-up locations (Broadway Bites, MadSquare Eats, and the new one on Vanderbilt). The BLT lobster roll is SO delicious. Once, I wanted to take a couple home to my parents in NJ and the super awesome guy at the Bway Bites location packaged everything separately- from the lobster to the bacon and even the scallions, each in its own little container, so that I could assemble the sandwich after my 40 minute bus drive! That way my Mom could experience it in its true state, and not the soggy mess it could've potentially been! So NICE of him. Also, its AMAZING how much lobster they stuff in there.  Love the BLT TOO MUCH. I've tried their other ones, which are also delicious and fresh- but the bacon and chipotle mayo on the BLT just make it something else entirely.
I was a guest tonight for a fundraiser and was saddened by the complete lack of quality and care at Gargiulo's. The food, presentation and staff were simply terrible. The servers behind the food table looked like they were slopping food on a tray at a prison. There were 5 servers literally dress 5 different ways. They all looked disheveled. One of them was the lady who usually is the bathroom monitor for the ladies room. Regarding the food: veal Marsala was tasteless; some sort of roasted chicken was extremely dry, tasteless and inedible; rice and spinach balls were tasteless; cold food spread was mostly gone and not replaced. It all looked terrible. The food is better at most pizzerias. I'm certain that the owners will say it was only a fundraiser and you get what you pay for. But the owners should have a little respect for their family establishment and especially for their customers. Also, I ate at the restaurant part this Summer and was totally unimpressed. I will not be back.
Broth in its core purest.  My fave is the spicy Karaka-men.  The akamuru is sim to karakamen just not spicy. This place has one of those ramen a that you will remember on a random day when you get hungry. They are known for their ramen. So get the ramen.  And truly savor every slurp. Easy with the slurp, it's fast. Slow down the bowl is big but it goes by quickly like our days. It.s delicious.  Also, must have the frozen beer. Miraculously that frozen foam stays kinda icy for a long time.  Cucumber is also smart- they slice / score it in a way that when you bite it it collapses in an ease way....good stuff. Staff is great. Wait is 20-30 min. But totally worth it.
I was really excited to try this place out because I am always down for handmade noodles. However, when I got here the staff was rude to us immediately. We were a party of 12 and we asked if they had available tables. The first lady straight up said no in a rude manner. The second lady was really nice and accomodating. She said there are bigger tables in the basement and asked if its okay if we sat down there. We were super hungry so we were willing to take whatevere there was. We waited 15 minutes for the table. We sat down in the basement and the first lady literaly just threw the menus onto the table and walked away. This was her second strike, but wait, there's more. Throughout our meal, she was consistently rude to us, slamming down our bowl of noodles and plates of dumplings onto our table, giving us our tea 30 minutes after we asked her to refill it, and even pushed one of my friends as we left because we were in her way apparently. The first few times of her rudeness was fine and we let it slip by, but the push at the end is completely unnecessary and made us feel really uncomfortable being there. I don't understand how someone working in the restaurant business can behave like this. I understand that this chinatown, but I really don't expect service to be this bad. Although the food was good, it was quite lacking in flavor. The dumplings tasted really homemade, but not restaurant quality to be honest. It was good but nothing memorable. I ordered the roast pork hand pulled regular noodles because it looked great from the picture - however, it was not like the pictures to my disappointment. Besides from the mediocre food, the prices are great. The restaurant is really small and cramped. I probably wouldn't be back here again because there are way more restaurants in Chinatown that offer the same price.
The decor is charming, but the food needs a lot of work if they're going to call it anything resembling authentic Southern/Creole cuisine. They lean way too heavily on Instagram-friendly deep-fried, deeply smothered food bombs, without capturing the real flavor of authentic Creole cuisine. Call me a snot, but I grew up on the Gulf Coast and ate seafood po-boys literally everyday for lunch in high school (I'm not saying that was a good idea, but I know from a good po-boy). These need a lot of work-- way too much bread, not enough seafood, not properly seasoned and no tartar sauce! Also, the crab cake benedict was a disappointment as the yolk was completely hard, as if it'd been sitting under a heat lamp for 10 minutes before serving. The praline bacon was limp; not even sure how they accomplished that. Maybe I'll have to try some other dishes to get a better feel for the quality, but my friend (who's been to New Orleans at least a dozen times) and I left feeling pretty disappointed. If I'm going to eat food that calorie-laden, it needs to be really worth it.
"This place deserves the almost 5 star rating. I highly recommend visiting Little Italy in the Bronx to find places like this! I'm so glad I chose Antonios Trattoria from the many choices in the neighborhood. My fiancé and I both ordered the ""Frutti Di Mare"" $25. The portions were huge! I had a full serving leftover for lunch the next day. The red sauce was flavorful and pasta was cooked perfectly. Tons of seafood too!  We visited a few weeks ago on a Saturday night and it was extremely busy. Fortunately, we only waited about 20 minutes for a table. They have an extensive wine list. We enjoyed our bottle of Tempranillo $33. Highly recommend making the trip here. Excellent service, food and environment."
I rarely go to Harlem for food because it is out of my way and not convenient.  However, this place is a hidden gem for me because I did not know this place existed until my friends told me.  I believe this place is good for fried chicken so we all ordered fried chicken.  The fried chicken was good and the frying was not over fried nor under fried. They were fried just right. The coating was done right as the crust was crispy and and not too thick. The chicken did not taste oily as well.  The chicken wings are huge compared to what you can get from other places.  Also, this place has plenty of space for a large parties and the restrooms are kept clean.  I've gotta say, this place is good for fried chicken!
Mu Ramen is on par with every other top Ramen spot I have tried. It has my favorite Ramen noodles in New York. They are thicker than most and I prefer the noodles that way. I like the tonkatsu which includes char siu pork and a pork based broth. As always, I add corn and an egg [soft boiled egg in Mu's case]. If you are looking for recommendations for good Asian food in New York, feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my personal list in the city, which includes my Yelp reviews. The information for an electronic copy can also be found via my Yelp profile.
Pleasant ambience - check  Friendly service- check  Delicious food - check  Reasonable prices- check  Kids friendly-  check  5 stars really no brainier  Happy New Year !
Very decent place, with cool food options. The buns and the pancit bowl were particularly tasty. Could use some improvements, however. Despite being a tiny space with limited seating, their takeout situation is not ideal. No double bagging, and the pancit bowl was spilling everywhere. The kimchi burrito was alright, but could use some refinement. It was pretty bland and lacked the spicy element you expect with kimchi. The meat was a bit dry and I wish there'd been more than just rice, kimchi, and chicken in the burrito. I would come back if only to try some of their secret menu items.
I came here a few years ago and came back recently with my boyfriend. I knew from before that it can be super difficult to get reservations here, so when a friend of mine couldn't use hers we said why not?  We waited about ten or fifteen minutes to be seated as it was busy when we arrived. The restaurant is pretty large and definitely has a bit of a party vibe to it around brunch time. Once we got to the table, we immediately settled on our sangria choices - the Havana Banana for me and the Samba for my boyfriend. He ended up getting the pollo ranchero, while I got the vaca frita. I was happy with my choice, but my boyfriend was a little disappointed by the pollo ranchero after trying my food.  Maybe it was just that we were pretty hungry when we arrived, but the dishes weren't as large as I would've liked, especially given that we were going to be drinking a lot of sangria. We also never got the bread bowl that a lot of other reviews mention. We sampled most of the flavors, and my favorite was the Tropical. Overall, I would say the whites were definitely better; the reds mostly tasted the same and didn't have a lot of the fruit flavors. Calle Ocho was alright but a little expensive given the quality and quantity of the food (and the quality of the sangria). If you're looking for a Latin bottomless brunch, I would recommend Boqueria instead, which is a little more expensive but infinitely more satisfying.
Meh. Wanted to like it more. I'll give it one more try since I live nearby. Otherwise I wouldn't bother.
Came to La Shuk for brunch since most of my co-workers live around the area and had heard good things about the brunch menu. I liked the idea of not coming for the standard eggs/pancakes deal and thought a Moroccan/Middle Eastern brunch would be a nice refreshing way to start my Saturday morning. Sadly, the food was pretty mediocre -- I ordered the green shashuka which is basically regular shashuka with spinach and feta.  Brunch crime #1- the egg wasn't runny. Is a mandatory runny egg yolk not the cardinal rule of brunch?  Brunch crime #2: the feta cheese sprinkled haphazardly throughout was still cold and tasted like supermarket feta crumbles.  Brunch crime #3 if I'm putting on pants on a weekend morning, I want my meal to be piping hot -- the kind of dish that is brought to the table where I'm scared to touch the plate and I can't do that at home because I'm scared of sticking my own dishes into that hot of an oven. My shashuka was lukewarm at best. Just another reminder why I don't leave the house on Saturday mornings. Sorry I am a Cranky McCrankerson.
"Just in case you have problems finding this location, they're nestled away in the back of the same building as the No 7 Sub.  That confused me for a bit... you might look at the building and think ""No, there can't possibly be anything back there""... but you'd be wrong cuz that's where their takeout window is.  Someone needs to teach their marketing guy a thing or 2 about the power of having your business visible to the general public... but I digress.  Onto the food: This summer I've been having my fill of lobster rolls, so instead, I decided to try the crab roll.  I watched with initial dismay as the attendant toasted the tiniest bun I've ever seen and thought ""Well there goes $14 down the drain""... however, when it came to stuffing in the crab meat... that bad boy was positively overflowing, so I was relieved.  I'm not sure what seasonings they put on this, but I loved it.  It was not sweet like a lobster roll is.  It's more savory and textured... a definite win. Now I have to go scope the other lobster joints for crab rolls too for comparison..."
My husband and I ate here on a Wednesday morning around 10 am and the place was packed. However, we only had to wait 10 minutes and a table opened up for us. The place is small and tables are sandwiched together. Like most restaurants in NYC, be prepared to sit next to strangers.  I'd like to add that I wanted this place to be a 5 star. I looked at forty restaurants and compared their ratings and menus and found that this place was the best for breakfast. I ordered the Nana's black tea with fresh mint and it comes hot so be prepared. I had to take mine to go because it didn't cool the entire time we were there. I ordered the poached egg and grilled tomato and halloumi entree with bread. Basically the cheese is at the bottom, them the tomato and then the poached egg. I misread the item because I thought it was a sandwich and it wasn't. The meal was okay but nothing to rave about and I wouldn't order it again. My husband ordered the green shakshuka and while it was flavorful, there was something missing; the wow factor.  All in all, the breakfast was good and service was great but there have been other breakfast places in NYC that have been/are better.  Food 3* Price 5* Service 5* Atmosphere 4*
The grits is perfect for me.  The eggs I can't even explain my brunch that my husband treated me to today.  Creamy grits gets me every time and let's not forget the cheese thinking about it I want more.
This is a late post: Order for lunch on Monday the 13 of Feb and was really disappointed with the food. The Pad Kee Meo have no taste and sticky rice with mango and coconut cream. First the Pad Kee Meo have no taste to it, the sticky mango coconut cream was really bad. The mango is so hard if I don't remember right most Thai place the mango is super soft and sweet. I couldn't even eat the mango. Sticky rice was ok nothing special to it. Very disappointed, will not order here again and also make sure everyone in my office know to be careful when ordering here.
This Lady is downright rude. The food is cheap. The reason people go is to stay for the show that entails her embarrassing people due to her own inadequacies. She can't get food on the table in a timely fashion and can't get good help! That's not my problem. You own the business lady! Put your big girl panties on and woman up!
"In three words? Not worth it.  Honestly, if you want comfort food, go spend $20-30 on a beer and a meal, instead of wasting that much on a single (bad) drink and a tiny, overpriced ""snack"" plate. I regret having given this place my cash, truth be told. If the pretentious, bougie, overpriced menu is any indicator, they put more stock in appearances than in actually producing food, anyway."
I seriously can say that the customer service is impressive and the food are good. I ordered pimento cheese burger and it was delicious. In addition, I bought chicken and waffles and it was mediocre. I truly liked my visit here. I will definitely return.
Nice ambience. The food was portioned right and tasted good. I had the barbecued chicken with garlic mashed potatoes along with mac & cheese and country sangria
I've been hearing for a while that Japanese curry was this weird, fun thing that had all kinds of interesting ingredients and sometimes even had fruit. The product that Go Go Curry sells is rice with a spiced gravy. Now that may be what Japanese curry really is and I can't say I'm super well schooled in that cuisine, but I've eaten here twice and just come away feeling like I ate something heavy and bland. It's also kind of expensive for what it is-- especially because the toppings, like katsu or shrimp, were both times the saving grace of the meal but added tremendously to the cost. Now I know that this is going to be one of those reviews where people say I just don't understand this kind of food, but I think in objective terms it's just not big on flavor. I will probably be back if I'm hungover because it would be perfect for that. Oh, also the hot sauce helps a lot.
Very othentic Italian restaurant. We have been here few times. Really like the atmosphere in the restaurant. Huge dishes   1 dish is more than enough for 3-4 people. We like the spaghetti with meatballs. Very good restaurant for families at a reasonable price.
Not sure if I'm late to the ramen craze, or if we've moved on to Poke but food doesn't go out of style right? So anyway we came across Mr. Morimotos spot thanks to Yelp and luckily our hotel was walking distance to this noodle haven. Usually a steaming bowl of noodles/ramen isn't my go to, but considering the 50 degree NYC weather in May -- why not? The inside is very dim lit and nicely accented with Asian flare and ... replica food dishes. Can't say I've seen that before. They have communal tables which is where we sat, a few booths and seating across the bar area.  To start we had the Crispy Mimiga (fried pig ears) and the Zuke Maguro, a tuna bowl with great flavor and spice. And when I say spice I mean you better have your water nearby. This thing is no joke. Our noodle choices were the Tonkotsu and Tantan. Not sure which of the two were better. If you want something 'lighter' I'd go with the Tonkotsu only because the Tantan is much thicker thanks to the coco curry base. And be warned, this bad boy is also nice and spicy.  Of course no Yelp outing is complete without a drink so we had the nigori sake carafe. Perfect amount for two people to enjoy. Our server came to pour the sake and let both pours run over into a little cup/tray under the glass. He said it was traditional and meant as a sign of blessings and whatnot and I'm all for it. (obviously have to drink the spillage). That was very cool and I appreciated the eye for detail and presentation in everything else. Overall great spot for dinner before exploring the city.
"Props to friendliness, ease of seating, clean, modern, hip decor down to the restrooms being sorta loungy.  The food was decent. Special mention goes to the bone marrow burger and Reuben croquettes. The burger was juicy on a potato bun although I can't remember anything remotely ""marrowy"" about it. Could be the 3 glasses of Malbec. The Reuben croquettes however, are small but stellar. Seriously, I'd love to cater 8 dozen of these or just know how they manage to cram that perfect fresh Reuben taste into a macaron...? Highly recommend you come for jus this app alone and probably catch an overpriced flick on a posh recliner because Tuck room is actually the 2nd floor of the seaport ipic theater."
Awesome food with an unnoticeable, appeal.  Whatever Traif was before it became Traif- it's working. It just has this funked out vibe that I love. Hostess was accommodating considering, we had no reservations and seated immediately in their enclosed back patio. Awesome! Traif may not look like much from the outside but interior's warm with an energetic feel; slightly coming off as romantic, but can highly be a cool hang out spot. (British 80s pop, rocked, but was a tad loud to follow a conversation). Our server, Shanice (apologies for any misspellings) was quick and so friendly throughout the night. Traif's main premise are on their Tapas; where you can go for their Tasting Menu or simply, do a few, individual plates.  Our Tapas we're lovely and so damn flavorful...with a price. The Crab On Polenta was freaking delicious, Mr. Man's, Pork Belly according to him, was cooked to perfection. My Japanese Pumpkin Tempura was airy and so tasty with Pomegranates as was my Sweet & Sour Shrimp. Cocktail variety was nice but my Zen Garden drink, lacked majorly in the intense factor.  Almost everything fell into place and their ventilation system was my biggest issue. Even stepping in Traif, the strong smell of food and smoke, filled the air and hit me quick and I just knew by the end of my meal and walking out of Traif, I'd be smelling like food- from top to bottom. With the exception of that big turn off, Traif is indeed a cool spot and wouldn't mind making the trip all the way from White Plains to Williamsburg, to enjoy their tasty Tapas.
Came here with two girlfriends and has the most incredible meal! I can see why it's impossible to get a reservation here after all these years...the tequila cucumber cocktail was well made and refreshing, the bread and olive oil were so tasty, the butter lettuce salad was really incredible (super light lettuce with flavorful Gorgonzola and perfectly seasoned!), the three pastas we tried were cooked to perfection (highly recommend the tagliatelle bolognese, lamb pici and their famous spaghetti with chilis and parm) and the rhubarb crostata with rose creme fraiche ice cream was heavenly. Get all of the above - you will not regret it!
being out of Dallas, TX.. this would be my only location that i have rated a 5 star.. i was told to come here if you luv lobster/shrimp/crab..  I got the Taste of Maine and WOW!!  A must come visit place, but recommend this location in S. Williams.. BTW, strongly suggest tonhave gumbwith you.. just say'n. lol
I was very impressed with everything about this restaurant! We were really excited to check this place out but were nervous about getting in since they don't take reservations for small parties, but luckily two of us got there early and claimed a spot while we waited at the bar for our other two friends.  At the bar, the friendly bartender gave me a drink menu and I was surprised to see that most of the cocktails were cheaper ($13) then just a glass of wine. The drinks looked very tasty and seasonal, however I wasn't in the mood for one so I stuck with a glass of Pinot Grigio. I had also noticed that a bottle of this wine was only $45 and split between the four of us was definitely worth it.  Finally the rest of my party arrived and they seated us at one of the few open tables left. We decided we would share an appetizer, each get an entree, and share a side. All of the appetizers looked good, but the one thing that was seriously calling our name was the side order of the truffle mac and cheese tart, so we got that to start. It was so truffley and creamy and delicious, I wish it was bigger. However, since it was so strong and heavy, it ended up being the perfect size so we could continue eating the rest of the meal.  I was going back and forth for so long about what to order, but I went with the mushroom crusted virgin chicken, with sweet pea risotto and truffle broth. It was one of the best chickens I've had in a while, probably the best in NYC. They serve one piece of white and a small piece of dark which is the perfect balance. The mushroom crust was so flavorful and worked well with the creamy truffle broth and risotto. Three of us ended up getting the chicken and one got the pumpkin risotto, which was beautifully displayed inside a pumpkin, and the perfect seasonal entree! As a side we got the roasted brussels sprouts with caramelized apples and woah were those good! It was dark so I didn't know if I was eating a piece of brussels sprout or a piece of apple, and the suspense was very intriguing.  Since it was two friends birthdays, we decided to share a dessert. My friends chose the apple tart, which wouldn't have been my first choice, but it was decent. The ice cream that it was served with was the best part.  When we got the bill, I was surprised to see it wasn't so bad for a bottle of wine, 4 entrees, an appetizer, a side, and dessert. It wasn't cheap, just wasn't as expensive as I expected. I definitely want to come back and try everything on the menu -- it all looked amazing! Definitely recommend this place for a nice dinner in the West Village.
First off, the luxe and gold encrusted decor amazes just about anyone. #instaworthy to the max.  My group ordered they royal pad Thai, massaman curry, a sweeter red curry, and duck confit. The royal pad Thai had 10/10 presentation and was tasty. My massaman curry dish hit the spot and the duck confit was cooked extremely well. I also ordered the mango drink, which resembles a mango lassi that's not as thick imo. This spot is located in a lively neighborhood with tons to do so you'll deff. spend a great night out on the town.  Overall, it was good but it didn't knock me off of my feet. It was memorable and could be great for business meetings and groups, but I don't have a dire need to return anytime soon.
The food was fresh and great: ravioli, gnocchi, veal. However, I had problems with the service. I noticed that the waiters were making fun of how one of the people I went to the restaurant with was eating the meat. They kept staring/laughing at/copying our gestures. I think the waiters and the manager crossed a line. I didn't have a good experience overall because of the incident. Not worth the money I paid there.
This was my favorite Peruvian restaurant in Manhattan,  however, the taste has changed in the past year. First, we (wife is Peruvian ) brought her family (tourists) ordered the Arroz Chaufa which didn't have enough eggs , scallions, and to much of sesame oil , Second, we ordered the ceviche mixo which had alot of onions, water , and alot of Conchita's. Unfortunately this was my American decision to go here. In Other words this is not the Authentic comida we were expecting. The place is very nice and the mix drinks with top shelf choice was good. I hope the Managers and Owners read there reviews. E.S New Jersey, USA
Coming from Boston, you take cheap lobster rolls for granted. This roll was good, by no means bad, but the price was too high for what you get, almost feels like you're being trapped into a tourist trap.
Doesn't worth staying for an hour in a line. Might be, if you are bored, might be if you've seen other places... but NO, it doesn't worth it
Food is great!!! but at the hostess station you see a sign, I think about happy hour, with a pic of the President and a sign that says, drink until he looks good. If you're not happy about an establishment that disrespects America's President, don't go here. If you don't care or think it's a good idea to disrespect the President, go here because the food is very good, with helpful staff and a nice interior.
So so so good! I would highly recommend this spot. We got the tie-dye, so it was a mix of pesto and vodka sauce. It was absolutely phenomenal! I would definitely go here again! The place is also really cozy and the staff friendly.
With so many italian restaurants to choose from in Little Italy, I wouldn't choose this one again. Service was just ok. Entrees were just ok, although the appetizers were pretty good. We had the calamari and the bruschetta which were both enjoyable. I had the gnocchi napoletano which was just ok. Others in our party were not thrilled with their meals. It was not air conditioned and on a hot NY day, that sucked. Waiter was blah. No fun happening in this restaurant. I expected more after the guy standing outside convinced us this was the best spot on the Little Italy strip. Wish we would have chosen some place else. Everything was mediocre.
i was pretty hyped to finally come here since it's been bookmarked and on my list for so long, but was disappointed when i got my food. my friend and i were seated quickly and the food came out in record-breaking times but it was verrry underwhelming. i wanted to try the corn but who the hell made it $10 for a corn on the cob??? jeez. everything's overpriced in my opinion. i got the enchiladas estilo norteno and i felt robbed -- not that much steak so it wasn't at all filling for me.
Some of the best barbecue in New York, maybe in the country is here.  Get the lamb belly banh mi, beef rib or anything else.  The flavors are different from the usual with some surprises like Vietnamese sandwich, Korean sticky ribs, Vietnamese chicken wings and Texas potato salad which really tastes like a mashed German potato salad, vinegary and I presume, mayonnaise-less.  My advice if you can, go at an off hour like 3 in the afternoon when there is a lull in the foot traffic.  This is my bf's favorite bbq now and the beef rib is worth the $25/lb.  My lamb belly banh mi was very tasty, and a nice departure from the usual BBQ sandwiches you get at BBQ joints because it had the refreshing flavor of the  marinated Vietnamese shredded carrots, daikon and coriander and a sauce that cuts through the richness of the lamb. I could only finish half of it because they are generous with their portion.  My bf had no problem finishing the other half for me after his beef rib.  My only criticism is the ordering of our non-alcoholic drinks at the bar.  It seems more expensive than if we could just get our sodas where we order our bbq.  I always feel obligated to tip the bartender so right there, it is more.  Other than this, Hometown is perfect especially for those who want beef ribs.   Not all bbqs have them or have them this good.
Even though i heard this place was meh, i still had to come for the hype and the instagram pic!  Came during the evening and ended up waiting about 40 minutes till I got my order.  1) Pick waffle base and can pay an extra 50 cents to have a filling  2) Pick ice cream flavor 3) Pick 2 toppings! If you want more toppings, it is an extra 50 cents. (however from reading the recent reviews, i think its unlimited toppings now??) Main complaints: I wanted strawberry ice cream but they were sold out :(( SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT. when you only have 3 flavors, you should definitely not be sold out of any of the flavors! Also, they definitely should add green tea as an option. I got 3 toppings, cookies and cream, condensed milk, and fruity pebbles. When I went to get my order, they forgot to add the cookies and cream topping and when i reminded them, they threw some on and tipped the whole cone over in the mean time, causing most of my fruity pebbles to fall over but the guy didnt even bother adding more on my cone. who does that!??!  Since it was a few days after chinese new year, they had complimentary fortune cookies which was nice.  The matcha waffle cone was just ok. It was crispy on outside and soft on the inside which is a good balance but you get sick of eating it after a few bites.  Spent $8.50 to not even finish the dessert was such a waste of money. Rather just go somewhere else and buy a cup of ice cream LOL something to try once but highly doubt I'll be back
This place was absolutely awful. Really disappointed as I wanted to like it being that I just moved less than a block away. I left offended, dissatisfied, and actually mad. I took two friends visiting from out of town here. Food was way over priced and portions were just okay - our appetizer was actually miniscule. Though it was tasty it wasn't anything I couldn't have made better myself at home.  The biggest problem was the service. There were several men walking around doing a whole lot of nothing, though obviously being paid. I'm certain one was either the manager or owner, totally oblivious to how poorly the place was running.  After finally coming over to us our waitress didn't even say hello and just looked at us like we were a nuisance and asked if we were ready. I ordered a bloody Mary, only after making sure their mix was homemade. I asked to have the bartender make it spicy. When it arrived it was in a tiny glass and not even full. It was also very watery and separated. I tasted  it and it was just awful,  it tasted like water and vile  tobasco sauce (which should never be served anywhere as far as I'm concerned). I usually don't send drinks back but this was just downright gross. When I did I heard the bartender and some other white man standing doing nothing start to complain about me sending the drink back and insinuating that I just didn't know what a bloody marry was. ..I could hear everything they were saying, the place is small. When they brought me my new drink it tasted exactly like the first one they brought me. The waitress was too busy having her ass groped by her boyfriend directly in front of us to check in with us even once after our food came. She sat less than 6 feet away from us counting her money while we waited and waited for the checks. Finally someone else brought them , he also messed them up and charged us wrong but by this point I just wanted to get the hell out of there. He said he hoped we enjoyed everything and I said I didn't and instead of asking what they could do to retain me as a customer he just nervously walked away. Honestly the whole experience was just pathetic . I was raised by a family of restaurateur's and have worked in many myself providing excellent service and I honestly don't see how that place is even staying business .  The only redeemable part of our experience was the bus boy who was polite , friendly,  and refilled our waters for us. Had I saw him before we left I would have slipped him the $30 tip that our waitress  (honestly not even sure who was supposed to be taking care of us) missed out on.
The venue is huge and has a rustic-chic french vibe to the interior. Dimly lit so you can't really take great photos of your food, BUT, service was great. I had the french toast and the eggs benedict with a friend and it was just okay. Nothing out of this world, just okay. Price is very steep since it's all organic. Small portions.
One star for completely atrouchous customer service. We contacted Tao to book a private party for 30 in the sky box. They responded with the menu's and confirmed they were available the night of our request. When we responded with a couple more questions the email was ignored. A month later I tried again, because we were very interested in booking and no response. You'd think they would give better service to a group that would have spent over 5 grand on dinner and drinks. Glad we didn't book given how bad the communication would have been for the event.
We really like the food here. It's tasty. However the service is lacking. We went here and were never refilled in water or asked if we wanted another cocktail. (Which we would have gotten if we had the chance). The drinks are quite overpriced. But that is typical for the area. I don't know if we just caught them on an off night or what. Nice ambience for a date though.
Did their preset menu along with some additional entrees. Everything was delicious. The service was a bit slow in the beginning. We had to keep flagging down someone to take a drink order.
I Went here for a friends birthday and it was okay. The food was actually pretty good. Each dish is around $17-$30. They had all the fixings, with a choice of dinner roll, salami and cheese. The service was a bit overbearing. The waiters seemed to be too on top of our table. They were all very friendly, but ou can definitely tell that it is a hotel restaurant. Worth going too if your a tourist staying in the hotel, but not if your a native to Manhattan.
Honestly, I was very disappointed by this experience. I read the great reviews of Joya and was excited to take my mom here for her birthday since she's never had Thai. The interior decoration was very hipster and lovely with Edison light bulbs and a cute outside seating spot. When we walked in, the restaurant was packed with people, but we were seated in about 15 minutes.  We were given a specials menu that was hand written and a regular printed menu. The specials menu was, in some ways, difficult to read. And they have a mixture of special appetizers and main dishes all jumbled up in there with no differentiation. So I ended up ordering an appetizer that I thought was a main dish, and thought that it was a main salmon dish that costs $17, but was completely something different - an appetizer that was $7. When they put it on the table, our entire table was very confused and we tried to clarify what we had ordered, what we had expected, etc. Three staff members had come over and just kept arguing with me instead of clarifying it.  During our entire meal, it was very difficult to get our waitress's attention. She had not come over once to see if everything was okay or if we had needed anything else. By the time we were done with our meal, it took several tries just to get her attention to pack our leftovers and for the check. She packed our leftovers, one of which was a liquid curry, in one of those paper take-out boxes rather than the plastic containers. Needless to say, we didn't want to impose anymore so we walked out hoping it wouldn't leak through. That was for sure not the case. By the time we got home, the liquid had leaked through completely, as well as through the plastic bag that was holding everything.  After getting our check, we waiting for quite some time for her to come pick it up, but she never did and we eventually went up to someone else to run our payment. Note: she was not the only waitress for the entire restaurant. She had other tables, but definitely neglected mine. So, I definitely give the service here a 1 star.  In terms of food quality, I was also very disappointed. We ordered the tofu appetizer, the tom yum soup, the salmon avocado mango roll, the mussels special, and the spicy noodles. The tofu appetizer was decent, the tom yum soup was salty, the salmon avocado mango roll I would not order again, the mussels seemed not fresh although the base was pretty good, and the only thing our table truly enjoyed was the spicy noodles. So I would give the food 3 stars. But our overall experience in the restaurant was 1 star, and I don't think I'd ever come back or recommend to others.
The crab roll is fine. The bread is soft and the butter along with the crab offers a wonderful fattiness with the crab meat. The crab meat has a touch of sweetness at points as well as some savory and umami. For $12, I wouldn't go back though.  Then again, this may be simply my issue with crab rolls.
Went on a Friday during happy hour and although the burger was great the service was horrible. From what I understand the place is always busy but you would think they would have figured out to manage the volume. Kept looking for the server for another drink and nothing is more annoying waiting just to order another drink after finishing one 10 minutes ago. I even had to go to bartender to ask for the check cause could not wait any longer. If you want the headache of waiting for drinks and food this is the place for you. Fairly priced and good grub but they lack when it comes to service.
ROACH IN FOOD! Last night, I had dinner at Joya, and had a dinner special Scallops Pad Thai. I didn't finish the meal and brought it home for lunch. Today, I ran to the fridge to finish the meal which was sitting in the same bag that the restaurant packed it in. Microwaved the meal began eating it in my brightly lit apt and low and behold a ROACH in my meal. I called the restaurant several times but they didn't answer their phone.
I made a reservation here because it could fit a party of 9. The restaurant was completely understaffed. It took 30 minutes to get orders in, and the staff was rude and not helpful. When our food came an hour after we ordered, it came staggered and wrong. They got multiple orders completely wrong, and my 85 year old grandmother had to send back meat because it was undercooked 3 times. After the final time (which was 2 hours after we ordered), she said she did not want the meal. The restaurant flat out refused to take it off the bill and threatened to call the police when we said we wouldn't pay for it. I hope this restaurant changes owners or closes.
I tried Ipanema because i wanted something different than the normal American, French, Italian but i was dissapointed by the place in many ways: the interior says 80s bank branch (sterile with smoked mirrors) rather than Brazilian. The patrons were overwhelmingly tourists wearing far-too-casual clothing for even a Sunday evening, and the food failed to impress, especially the reliance on rice and black beans to serve as fillers. the service was polite, but over-pushy on dessert, and not good at water refills. Not recommended.
Ridiculous pasta, great wine selection and atmosphere. Also pretty good pricing for this level of quality in the city. Will return for sure. Gn
"It was a bummer to pay $140 and leave hungry... Spend your money elsewhere. Arugula salad - just a pile of arugula, and it came without dressing Caprese Salad - mealy tomatoes not fresh, mozzarella ice cold with freezer crystals still on it Veal - under seasoned, with undercooked side dishes Calamari - underwhelming. light on the meat, heavy on the garnishes Cheesecake - ""meh"" from the table, tasted frozen / defrosted like Sara Lee. Even the free bread was stale. Good ambiance, decent service. But the food is really not worth it."
After all the rave about this place, I dragged my family in for a meal while in NYC. The texture of the noodles are good however the taste of the ingredients were bit on the spoiled or old meat side. We did arrive towards the end before they were about to close so maybe we that's the reason why it wasn't so fresh.
My second time here was on Sunday for a pre-show dinner. We didn't have reservations but for 2 people we got sat immediately. Though for groups I do recommend reservations as it gets busy. It's close to Time Square and the Theaters so definitely plenty of tourist and pre/post show traffic. They seem to have additional dining on the 2nd floor as well.  I had the Beef Carpaccio salad & my friend had the Tricolori salad. She had the Veal Osso Buco for her main course & I got the Risotto. Everything was really good.  Nice ambiance, good service. Good food. Reasonable prices. Had a good experience both times.
I love the fact that this place is Vegan, it feels cozy inside and they do cool things like Tea ceremonies and live music.  I dislike that our host forgot about our order and didn't really check on us after having us sit in the waiting area (They were too full). We tried the feast for two so I got to try a little of everything, I thought it was too bland for my taste and they only have one dessert option (Baklava), it tasted cardboardish.  The Drink list looks good but the overall service can be a bit non attentive.
"We stopped to visit some friends from Germany who were staying at an AirBnB in Brooklyn. When we started to look for something for dinner we discovered that Peaches Hothouse was just down the street. Because seating is limited and there were a bunch of us we opted to order take out and eat back at the AirBnB. The order was easily placed and ready in the promised time frame.  I ordered Shrimp & Grits. There were an ample number of well cooked shrimp on top of a generous dollop of smooth, creamy, buttery grits. I was anticipating a bit more depth of flavor in the sauce, but it had all the components of what one would expect. The rest of my friends ordered fried shrimp or fried chicken and an assortment of sides to share (including: Collards [a bit under seasoned and they could have benefited from some more ""fat"", I.e. bacon, ham hocks, etc.], Black-eyed Peas & Corn {a tad bland for me], Mac & Cheese [didn't taste], Slaw {tangy goodness]). Those who ordered ""hot"" said they were glad they didn't go all the way as hot was plenty spicy. Portions were generous and our fiends had plenty of left-overs for lunch the next day. Despite my critique of several components of our meal, I was more than satisfied and would certainly eat at Peaches again if I am ever in the neighborhood. And for our fiends from Germany, they got a great taste of an authentic genre of Southern American comfort cuisine."
Ok ok I guess my cousin really wanted to see what the hype was all about. She woke up early to get in a shorter line (than the night before when we attempted) to get this expensive but delicious pizza :) I love white sauce selection because I'm not a fan of tomato sauce!
Located in Battery City Park, this place is a semi tourist trap/ those who don't know better for Shanghai food. It is very quintessential for a huge markup on their food and waiters who have mastered the art of casually egging you to order more food.  First of all: great view of the water. The markup for food is likely due to rent in this area. Do yourself a favor and sit by the window here or on a nice day outside.  Food:  Xiao long bao / Soup Dumplings: I'm very annoyed that this place will charge 8 dollars for 4 soup dumplings. That's right - 2 bucks a pop. There isn't anything wrong with the taste of the soup dumpling, but for 2 bucks a pop, not worth it. The soup dumpling isn't amazing or grandstanding to make it cost far more than any of the places in nearby Chinatown.  Shanghai style rice cakes: This is my personal favorite to order no matter where I go. There is a certain way to cook this and unfortunately this place cooked it in a strange way. A usual rice cake dish has different types of lettuce, mushrooms, lotus roots stir fried with rice cakes, pork and maybe beef sometimes. This place made theirs with sour vegetables: while not terrible, it made an unusual taste to a pretty standard dish.  Scallion pancakes: Tasty good and a pretty standard dish.  Shumai: They 'encouraged' my friend and I to order this; it wasn't bad but again nothing amazing.  Service was extremely attentive, to the point where they were hovering. Then again, we came on a relatively slow night and no other patrons were here.  Overall, while the food isn't terrible, it isn't amazing, and the prices are overly marked up for the quality of food you receive.
While I'd like to be more enthusiastic about this spot, I can't due to inconsistency of service. There are times they've been spot-on and others where they seemingly don't care. Good drinks, limited but well-curated eats menu of snacks. Nice outdoor space.
Great great great Italian food on the UES! Everything is homemade and fresh! GoT cheese crostini appetizer is absolutely amazing as is all their pastas! The restaurant itself is adorable and the service is great! Do make a reservation on the weekends! This is one of my favorite Italian places of all time!
"Wow what happened though?  Food was terrible*, drinks were  Sub-par**Huge bummer *""pork belly"" was an over cooked pork chop  **fix your martini olive game ASAP"
Came here for RW a few weeks ago and was a little disappointed. We got the crab cakes to start which was probably the highlight of the meal.  These were perfectly fried and crispy.  Very flavorful. For the entree, we both got the salmon.  The salmon itself didn't have too much flavor which was all brought on by the sauce on the side.  The sauce was spicy!  Definitely had a kick to it which I really liked.  The rice was sticky rice which might be the norm for Laotian food but it wasn't very chewy.  The sticky rice I'm used to is usually quite chewy so I was a little disappointed on that. For dessert, I just go the ice cream.  Nothing special. What got me really annoyed was how they charged you $5 for water.  Usually they will inform us if the water was extra charge since we got sparkling water but 1) they didn't inform us and 2) it was given to us in one of those glass refillable containers.  When it's in those refillable bottles, I have never been charged for any sort of water - sparkling or still.  I'm only charged when it comes in an unopened branded bottle.  And since we ordered two, they charged us $10 for that.  For water! It was completely ridiculous.  And I know for a fact that other restaurants who serve sparkling water in those refillable containers don't charge since I just ate at another restaurant who didn't charge us for sparkling.  What a hoax!
Eh. Definitely southern white food for people who have never had authentic southern food. Food was overpriced and decent at best.  The restaurant was also FREEZING. The heat was not turned on until we we had finished our food and were walking out. The waitress actually took so long to give us our check that my friend jokingly suggested that we leave without paying. It wasn't worth the money.
Mediocre, overpriced Japanese food.  Our surly wait person could use some training in customer service.  Leave this place for tourists that don't know any better.
So I gave this a rating of 4-stars a few weeks and that was based on the chicken and basil dumplings, which I actually liked. I then had the vegetable dumplings, which we very bland and had nothing to them. I wanted to try it again and had the pork and chive dumplings, which were mediocre at best. The place is kind of trendy and people are always in there but I don't get what all the fuss is about. They still get 3-stars for the chicken and basil dumplings but that's all. Even their bubble tea was unimpressive.
The service was terrible -- 2 and a half hours to get food, the food was underwhelming and overpriced, and there was no sense from the restaurant that this was absolutely unacceptable. Will never come here again.
Came with a decent sized group for a birthday brunch on a weekend afternoon.  Restaurant is quite large, with great ambience and neat decor throughout the entire space.  Great for large groups; as service was excellent and food came out pretty quickly.  What we ordered:  - Brussel sprout hash - basically exactly what it sounds like. Shredded seasoned brussel sprouts with a sunny side egg on top.  Nothing super fancy about it, but was surprisingly very flavorful.  - Mac & Cheese - Neat presentation, as it was served in a rectangle and had fried onions on top.  Not mind blowing, but satisfied a craving I was having at the time.  Great spot for any meal or just to grab a drink.  Will definitely be back.
"We arrived around 8:30pm. We were told there was about a half hour wait, but I believe we got seated at 8:40ish. Not bad at all! Again, small and crowded NY restaurant. I got bumped into by strangers several times. Very dimly lit with loud music. But who cares?! The food was tasty!  I'm a VERY picky eater, but I was feeling adventurous. I went out on a limb and suggested Cafe Habana. I was wondering why and how this was put on my list of restaurants, then I realized it was featured in that Justin Timberlake/Mila Kunis movie called, ""Friends With Benefits."" Anyway, back to my review. I like Mexican food (some), so I thought, ""Hey, how bad can Cuban food be?""  I ordered the Pollo Mirador- sauteed chicken breast with spicy spinach, rice, and roasted garlic sauce. I love me some garlic. You can probably imagine how in love I was with this dish when it arrived and there were sooo many pieces of garlic. My boyfriend got enchiladas estilo norteno, which is just pretty much steak enchiladas. It was my first time trying enchiladas, and let me say--- definitely not a bad experience at all! It was good! I've been missing out on yummy enchiladas all this time! We didn't order the mexican corn or the plantains like I had hoped, but it's okay because we were completely stuffed after eating. Our waitress was adorable and sweet."
Located around South Street seaport! Popular spot for tourists, for happy hour for corporates big bar, lots of space, traditional decor walked in for late lunch, they have a 4pm menu for happy hour, small bites but we went with the lunch menu 1. steak burger big juicy steak, it was really good. even the fries are amazing 2. mushroom risotto mushrooms are amazing, sauce is decent, but the rice is not good, it was not soft rice like most other risotto dishes would have, it was pearled barley instead of rice. and i did not like it service was soso would recommend to come here for drinks. if you are looking for a afternoon snack, good place too. but a proper lunch/dinner, i would not recommend.
Perfect venue for an after work drink. Bartender's are very attentive and the place has COLD beer! Great anytime but especially on a hot summer evening in NYC.
Delicious meal and impeccable service!  Visiting from out of town, highly recommend Da Claudio to locals.
Inside, is much larger than one realizes from the street. But tables are crammed next to each other.  I ordered their Pasta Trio. Each were well made.  Didn't get that home-made taste and texture I was hoping for. Again, the expectation was high perhaps.
Good place located in downton manhattan，nice owner and great Italian food，love it！
This used to be my favorite pizza place of all time! The Brock oven pizza, the nice area, you get the idea. Today, my sister and I and our 2 kids went in for lunch after skating nearby. The waiter came and took our order. He brought out drinks. A different gentleman brought our pizza. The original waiter never came to check on us to see how we were doing or if we needed anything. We get the check...and HE ADDED A $7 TIP! We ordered 2 pies...and 3 drinks...that came to $40 and $3.50 for tax. HE HAD THE NERVE TO ADD A $7 Tip! I called him over to explain the bill...and he proudly indicated that gratuity was included. I was highly annoyed! I understand the waiters want to get tipped appropriately. However, maybe  the issue is the service of the staff and not the patrons of the restaurant. Not sure if I will be attending this restaurant again.
"Food: excellent, almost as good as DGS was.  A couple of the items I've had over the past couple months (including the time when it was still called DGS, but the dinner menu was almost completely transitioned to Al Mar Italian) have been awesome:  lasagna (one of the best I've had), tagliatelle with duck ragu (awesome), braised short rib (I thought it was good on one occasion, but a friend had it when it was somehow dried out).  So hey, the food is good. But let's talk about atmosphere: I showed up one night with a couple friends, and it's now called Al Mar.  Walk in, and things are a bit different.  An older guy shows us to a table, and starts volunteering information about how they ""canned"" all the ""kids"" who used to work there, because they didn't know anything and were unprofessional. OK, fair enough.  Cut to ten minutes later--the people next to us are served the wrong food.  No big deal, they go back and bring out what was ordered.  Twenty minutes later--(young) waiter brings us plates.  ""Who had the lamb?""  Well, nobody had the lamb.   ""Oh.  Maybe this is the beef."" I don't know, is it?--you work here and you can't tell dishes apart?  Manager comes over, asks if there is a problem.  Waiter looks at us expectantly, forcing us to ask if the dish is lamb or beef, and generally looking like morons.  This happens to the table on the other side of us. Lesson:  Don't fire the staff unless you can hire competent replacements.  I'm willing to allow for a learning curve, but I've been back since and there's been no improvement--staff still can't tell dishes apart, very slow service.  Moreover, DGS was nice because it was exceedingly unpretentious...not so much anymore. Plus...why change the name?  Al Mar I can have anywhere.  DUMBO General Store...there can be only one."
Had to wait in line for quite a while -- around 15 minutes. The employees here seemed confused, and they kept telling different people they were out of certain things, then changing their mind and telling them they weren't actually out of it.  I ordered the small short rib with mac n cheese, and some sort of mixed vegetable. At first I was told that I couldn't have the short rib in a small size box, but then the guy changed his mind and said that yes, I could have it in small size instead of large. Confusing. The short rib was so fatty, and picking through the meat with my plastic utensils was difficult. The mac n cheese was dry. The veggies were pretty good. The sauce on the short rib was delicious, so if the short rib had been cleaned of fat a bit better, it probably would have been really good. There are better lunch carts in the area. This was overpriced.
We arrived on a Sunday afternoon for Brunch and were seated in 15 minutes. Staff here is friendly and attentive. This place does get busy so expect a crowd outside the restaurant.  Fried Pork Chop & Cheddar Waffles $17 - Not a bad alternative from the chicken & waffles. The skin was crispy, but not over-cooked. The pork chop was very juicy and flavorful. You get a huge pork chop but the waffles were small. The waffles sat underneath the pork chop, causing the waffles to be flattened into a pancake. I dowsed my pork chop and waffles in maple syrup. Best decision ever. Short Rib Hash $16 - Too dry and burnt. My fiancé had to use some of the maple syrup for taste. I was expecting something with more flavor, and bigger. There wasn't much short rib in the hash. Personally, I'd come back for dinner (chicken & waffles). I've had it before and it is much better than the pork chop.
I always go for the Taco Platter when I'm here. During my most recent visit I chose Tempura Fish, Grilled Steak, and Chipotle Chicken. I also got a Breakroom Fries that I shared with my friends.  Taco Platter: I love that they weren't stingy and were very generous in filling the tacos with a LOT of meat. Because of that, the single flour tortilla barely held everything together for each taco, which made them a little messy to eat. By no means am I complaining (because how can one even complaining about being given MORE meat), but I think going forward, doubling up on the tortilla would probably help.  Breakroom Fries: It's a lot of fried goodies all in one aluminum foil pan! There are tater tots, fries, bacon, and a fried egg. I love the jalepeno slices; they give a slight kick. There aren't many seeds, so you don't have to worry about burning your tongue off. There's an array of hot sauces to choose from. However, my friends and I found that there were many bottles that were nearly/completely empty, especially the more popular ones (i.e. original Cholula and the green El Yucateco were harder to spot).
"We decided to try Toloache for a girlfriend's birthday and had the WORST experience. From beginning to end was a shit show. First of all- they claimed that we did not have a reservation...when I have proof of calling & even confirmed the location. So we went to the bar to wait for a table to open up and start ordering drinks. I hear the older woman hostess aggressively YELLING my first and last name...so I guess they found the reservation? Because I only said my first name whilst attempting to check in. Anyhow, a table was ready- yay! We went ahead to pay for the drinks but the hostess gives us a nasty look, proceeds to shout my full name & impatiently motions for us girls to hurry up to the table. Classless. IT GETS WORSE.  We were seated around the window and some dude from outside whips out his penis & starts masturbating right in front of us. Wonderful. Moving on... We brought our own cupcakes & had asked for a candle on one of them for the birthday girl. They said it would be $1 per person which we were cool with. Out comes the dessert dishes FIRST then the cupcakes WITHOUT a candle on any one of them. Thanks for ruining the surprise. Insult to injury, we got charged $16 for the ""distribution"" of our own dessert. Which of course we refused and ended up paying $5 as promised after speaking with the manager (who was pleasant, so the 1 star on this review goes to him). The food was boring & portion sizes were laughable.  What a bummer since I was looking forward to Toloache after reading all of the great reviews. I will appreciate the food & service at Rosa Mexicano and/or Dos Caminos that much more."
Disappointed.     Close tables, 8-12 inches apart, noisy, Non-description 'music'. Difficult to have a conversation.  Bread was good, but not outstanding, but olive oil was fantastic. Wines were excellent, one Lambrusco and one from Calabria.  Appetizer of beets and ricotta and blueberry was a winner.  Pasta with mushroom ragu very good, but a bit dry.  Ordered crispy potatoes. Amazing and delicious/ enough for four people.   My charred octopus was not a winner.  Very small portion with too many chiles and potatoes. The Branzino was just ok, but no where near as good as some we've had at other restaurants. We will probably not be back.    I like a restaurant where you can have a conversation and not have to shout.
"Not sure what the hype is....kind of mob mentality, that if there is a long line or a big gathering of people, and admittedly delicious food smells, that automatically means something good is cooking....and whoop...the line grows some more.  Unfortunately, I was not impressed, and after dodging, or knocking, into clusters of tourists (who randomly stopped), at times (to be blunt) very large people that you could not go around at all, and families with their endless strollers, I was ready to leave.  And what I did try wasn't all that: Ramen burger $10 -- are you kidding me?! It was the size of a kid's burger at McDonald's, not to mention that the ingredients are super cheap -- instant noodles, burger patties in bulk, probably from Costco, and some cheese/sesame oil. Daaaamnnn, are they making a killing on people willing to try out a novelty. Wish I had thought of that concept. It was super greasy, but beyond that, the ramen buns were a soggy mess, tasted as if it were drenched in sesame oil, and the flavors overall with cheese/meat did not go well.  Mighty Quinn's Brisket Slider (small) $5.00 -- Dry meat, but that's what the bbq sauce was for. A bit too sweet. Would have preferred creamier cole slaw, but overall not a bad bite.  People's Pops Shaved iced -- two flavors (cherry vanilla and watermelon). Small cup, $2.50  Dough - big doughnuts! But the icing looked a bit sloppy or almost melty, but it was hot. $3.00 Piece of Velvet -- had some nice large slices of red velvet cake.  I had been eyeing the Milk truck grilled cheese sandwiches, hand cut fries, but the lines were too long, and the heat was getting unbearable. Hot foods on a hot day outside? No thanks. Maybe in the Fall. I was close to getting BFC chicken/waffle, but I kind of like to pour syrup over my waffle, to get the salty/sweet combo, and I had a feeling they would be kind of stingy with that. I didn't want to choke down a dry waffle.  I will say that almost every person selling something/serving/collecting money was super friendly, and easy-going. Smiles all around, even taking the time to banter on a hot, humid day. It's refreshing to hear someone say ""Have a good day, guys"". Can't even get that from the host in a normal restaurant anymore.  Great view, cooler by the water, could walk on the sand to work off some of those calories, some trees for shade, some tables to eat at, and plenty of other steps/cement wall structures to sit on briefly. Beware -- plenty of duck poop all over. The ducks were cute in the water though, even if they messed up the soles of your shoes."
"Not worth the wait or the effort to get to.  I was curious to try them out after hearing high praise for their wings but found them to be incredibly salty and very scrawny.  The other dishes we tried were similiarly underwhelming: Pork Belly (Kaeng Hang Leh) - OK, just braised pork belly doused in soy and fish sauce. Curry Noodle Soup (Khao Soi Kai) - Tasted a bit watered down, not spicy at all. Fried Catfish (Cha Ca ""La Vong"") - Their take on a famous dish from La Vong Restaurant in Hanoi, Vietnam - a passable imitation at best.  Didn't help that it came out cold. Portion were on the small side considering everything is meant to be shared.  Better off heading to SriPraPhai in Woodside or Ngam in the EV for a more authentic and tastier experience, with the added bonus of being more accessible. I'm amazed this place has a Michelin star - the 3.5 average rating from Yelp is much more accurate!!!!"
Whoa. Grimaldis pizza has paper plates and plastic knives?  We sat in the second floor which is not air conditioned so we were very hot the entire time. The place is a dump of a restaurant. The tableclothes are stained, they don't offer any bread as an appetizer. I wish I could rate this place some negative stars. It took forever to get the check and then we were told it was cash only. What kind of place is cash only?!?  Obviously this place does not care about customer service. Terrible service. Terrible environment. The waiters seem like they should be working in a mall food court. Big tourist trap.  If you want an authentic pizza go to Julianna's next door to grimaldis. Still run by the Grimaldi family and they take care of you there. The pizza was an altogether different issue. My family eats pizza in every city we visit. When a thin crust pizza is cooked correctly, it is not gooey. We ordered a cheeseless pizza and it still came out gooey. I've never seen a pizza like this that was not crisp. It's like they do not know how to cook a pizza or try to do it very quickly. Or maybe they prep the pizzas in the morning and the sauce sits on the pizza. Either way the pizza sucks.  I absolutely hated everything about this place. Don't wait in line for it!  Soggy pizza. Rude waiters. They hide the tip in the bill. Cash only. No AC. No appetizers. What a DUMP!
After wandering around Central Park all day, we chose Tanner Smith's for dinner.  We made a bold, yet scary choice with our appetizer.  We chose roasted cauliflower with watermelon curry & dill pick aioli.  I know!  Sounds weird!  I don't care how weird it sounds!  Kudos to whoever came up with this combination of flavors.  We couldn't get over how amazing it was.  I really want to figure out how to make it.  Somehow we both ended up order the same entrée.  We had the hanger steak with Brussel sprout hash & fingerling potatoes.  Holy Moly!!  The steak was great, and I'd never had Brussel sprout hash before, but it was also incredible.  The potatoes...well, they were just potatoes.  They seemed underwhelming when everything else was over the top.  However, they did come with a strange little mustard dipping sauce.  Not really sure if it was for the steak or potatoes.  I don't even like mustard, but a smidge on the potatoes really kicked them up a notch, and made them more exciting.  Very pleased with or meal here!
"I'm itching to say this place is overrated. but then we've only come in for a quick dinner and we were seated in an awkward spot. Lastly, maybe, just maybe, they're another new place trying to figure things out. but hey, I'm a tourist and I don't have to come back here, HA! first of all can I start with how weird it is, at least for me, that they don't serve bread before a meal? come on, half of your menu is carbs, don't you want to at least tease us with how well you can manipulate wheat and dough for a little bit before we start? don't you want to show off your collection of olive oil and balsamic vinegar?  fine, maybe it's a new york thing. as I said we wanted a quick dinner so I ordered the squid pasta and my friend got the orecchiette. my pasta was overcooked - the pieces were limpy, they all stuck together (let me rephrase: not coated evenly in sauce), and not salted correctly. I have a very light palette, so if it's not salty enough for me, it's probably not salty enough for 99% of the population. maybe they've reached an agreement with the American Heart Association. My friend's orecchiette was decent, the texture of the pasta was right, the sauce was flavorful and on the sour side, the only complaint was there wasn't enough sausage in the sauce. once again, they might have an greement with the American Heart Association the service was luke warm at best. our waiter did stop by our table once to check if everything's alright, but afterwards, he completely ignored us. we sat at the table for at least another 15 minutes after we were done with our entrees, had an entire conversation going from ""do you feel like having desserts"", ""what kinda dessert are you thinking?"", ""tiramisu or cannoli"", ""do you think we have time for desserts at this point?"" to ""god we really need to get out of here"". We ended up having to flag down another waitress and she found our waiter for us. as I said, I'm a tourist so I don't even need to convince myself to give this place another chance. and then the idea struck me - this is NYC, there are ten restaurants on each block, nobody needs to give any place another chance if they don't want to.  yes, sauce and barrel, get your sh*t together. I think you still got potential, but this is not a culinarily forgiving city and standing out is tough."
"Came here for ""tapas."" Wine glass list was ok.. Found a nice white, but overpriced. Disappointed that there was only cheeses and meats, sandwiches and cold salads. There's not even a full kitchen here, it's behind the bar. Our cheese was good (hard to mess that up), salad was boring w too much dressing, and sandwich was really blah. I liked the cheese and chips that came with the sandwich. I am a wine lover, and would come back for vino butttt, the bartender was terrible. He had the personality of a wet rag and cared more about his iPod playing crap music than anybody else. Tables were coming up to him to give back dirty dishes, order drinks and pay.. And it was early and not very busy. Lighting was cool and ambiance wasn't bad.. But was unimpressed with the bartender and food choices."
Cool looking place.   Wanted to love it.  Food was 'meh'. Service... slow. (Food came very fast! With a server, not our waitress)  but  waitress? V-e-r-y  s-l-o-w....  15 mins for Bill to come... could count number of people in restaurant.  People behind us got up and went to bat to get their own drinks.... Steak Frites- nice size. Not a big meal. Perfect for later when you need real food with drinks. Maybe it's a thing when you're in the city, but I have a hard time ignoring Roaches on the floor and on the wall. Others did not seem to notice, so maybe it's just me. Not sure why this place does so well on Yelp. It was not horrible, but I expected something far better.
"Although I'm a fan of ramen, I am far from a ""ramen snob"". I'll happily devour a bowl of slightly-below average ramen any day. That being said, I'll never go back to Zurutto. We ordered the Sesame Cucumber because it sounded refreshing and tasty. What was disappointing about it wasn't just the fact that it was one sliced cucumber with sesame oil and sesame seeds, but that it didn't taste good and didn't warrant the $6 tag. Next, came the Spicy Zurutto Ramen. The broth was unusually thick for a chicken broth, although it may have been the miso. Regardless, the flavor and texture of the broth wasn't good, and there was a hint of old-refrigerator-food flavor as well. The noodles were harder than most (though some prefer it so), and the boiled egg was cold. The only good part of the dish was the roasted pork, which was smokey and delicious. Anyways, if you're drunk and craving ramen in the area, it might satisfy your needs, but other than that, THUMBS DOWN!"
"Chose this place for my mother's 70th birthday and it did not disappoint. Made reservations at midnight on the dot 1 month ahead of time and was only able to get a 6:00 PM spot-but worked out great. Nice, classy ambiance and some unique ingredients. I had the escolar for crudo, buckwheat cavatelli (because when you get the opportunity to eat wild boar, you eat wild boar), and the Hazelnut for dessert. Husband had the Pici lamb neck ragu and he loved it. Not sure what the escolar fish actually tasted like because it was overpowered by the lemon olive oil it it was floating in-I LOVE lemon and the flavor so I didn't mind. Olive oil dessert cake with crème fraîche was great-The hazelnut ice cream with caramel bits was delicious-the cake that came with it was hard and flavorless. Service was good. The portions are ""small"" by American standards but perfectly filling by normal people standards. I'd come here again."
I love this place. The beef chow fun is great. They have a rice noodle with peanut and hoisin, sesame sauce reminds me of H. K. Wonderful soups. They cook the Chinese broccoli just right. I go there often and bring friends.
"I was there last night with my family and since my cousin just came from overseas I decided to take her out to eat. We went to Astoria and we decided to go at this place since it was not crowded. The worst experience ever!! First of all we were so hungry we ordered appetizers which took forever to come. Meanwhile the guy sitting next to us knew the Chef and he had more than 3 main dishes coming to him one after the other!! The CocaCola we ordered came to us after 30 min. At a point my husband got so frustrated he got up and left. The manager came to ask me if everything is okay and i told him what is going on. He suggested that he will wrap up the food so we can take it home. ""Supposedly "" he went and talk to the GM and he comes back with a business card telling me that he is sorry for what happens and he wants me to call the GM so the next time i get there i get 20% of the bill! Not sure what made them think That I will ever go back to this place. The service sucks and i tried to be patient with the service but it seems like they dont know how to treat new customers!! I would never recommend this place to anyone!"
What a terrible experience. We came in and sat down and waited around 15 minutes for someone to serve us. My wife and I watched two other couples in this uncrowded restaurant get their drinks AND orders taken. No one came to our table. I even watched as a waitress and waiter discussed who would serve our table...and then watched as they argued...and then watched as NEITHER OF THEM served us. Pretty messed up. My wife and I walked out (at this point we had watched 3 tables get served before us... Same waiter) and will never come back here again. Stuff like this really gets my brown blood boiling.
"I am only giving the second star because the food and drinks were good I wont take that away from them however READ ON!!!  I have been struggling with whether to make this a Yelp review but I figured I would inform management first. I attended a Black Law Student Association event at your establishment a week ago. The event was nice the atmosphere and food were great but unfortunately I left my credit card at the bar and forgot to close out my tab. I returned the next evening and explained to the Bartender, that took my order the night before, that I left my card at the bar, he kindly asked me my name and went to look for it. This is where my issue begins. He returns shortly after and says to me ""your card is not here I have no open tabs, I am sure I remember closing you out."" As I was about to inform him that my classmates and I do not all look alike I checked my attitude and kindly stated "" I am sure that you are mistaken."" The bartender searched again and then asked if I asked my friends if any of them checked me out. I began to become very worried as I began to realize the possibility of my card being handed over to someone other than myself at the end of the evening. I then leave again, in the rain, go to my car and call all of my friends that were there to ask anyone had mistakenly left with my card. Finding that none of them had it I went back to the bar. At this time the Bartender goes to another register where he says there was a note and he indeed has my card. The Bartender then goes to the same cup that he checked a number of times previously and low and behold he finds my card. As he gives my card to me he explains that the waitress did me the favor of checking me out and in the process did herself the favor of 20% gratuity. This is unacceptable. First she is not an authorized user on my account and thus it is a crime for her to authorize any payments on said account. Further she was not even my waitress so even if I would have decided to leave a 20% tip she would not have been the beneficiary of it. It is a breach of consumer trust for your employees to be allowed to charge a consumer's card while adding extra on for themselves at the end of the evening. If this is the the of behavior that I can expect I will not patronizing your establishment in the future."
Went for lunch yesterday with high expectations. Ambiance was nice and service not bad. Food was beyond mediocre. Got Cacio e Pepe, as it was the only pasta without pork, which was solid but nothing special. Then got the trout which was very fishy, cold, uninteresting, bland, and overall a 2/10. My client had the Scaloppine which was mealy and potentially undercooked. For 4 people, 2 courses each and a bottle of white for the table, the meal was $320. I could've gotten a severely more nutritious and satisfying meal at @DigInn for $17. Never been for dinner which I imagine would be better, however our experience was absolutely nothing to run back for.
5 stars for the Brunch music playlist on Saturday! A great mix of Hip hop/Top 40's and throwbacks! I like that Union has different options for reserving your table. You can choose bar seating, high tables, or seated tables. When making a reservation I was a bit puzzled but it makes sense once you get to the restaurant. $33 for all you can drink brunch (mimosas, Bellini's, or bloody Mary). I wasn't blown away by the food options; they are your standard American brunch chx & waffles, various omelettes, steak & eggs (for an upcharge), burgers (toppings are all additional $), etc. and the food won't be remembered much. I had to dress up my burger like a baby's first Christmas photo so I definitely wouldn't recommend it. I'm talking salt, pepper, hot sauce, asking for more onions, then rearranging it all because it was just... tasteless :(. However the service was great, smiling faces and attentive hosts and waiters.  This is a small establishment and did get cramped near the entrance since people were at the bar watching the game but a host sat us after we flagged 'em down. You'll overhear neighbors conversations (one I wish I didn't) but again - the music & bellini carafes did it for me *shrug*
The menu is simple and easy to understand. If you like burgers and / or lobster there will be something here for you. I would have given this place five stars but the service kinda sucked. The waiter was nice but virtually nonexistent during our meal. We had to flag other people down for items we had previously requested.
When I read a tip that said the chef from the now-closed Goody's in Chinatown had moved here(not verified), I was excited to try it.  I came in for a weekday lunch once and it was empty.  Understandable, since 86th street is ridden with restaurants closer to public transportation. We ordered the Pork Soup Dumplings, Scallion Pancake, and upon the waitress' suggestion, the Dong Po Pork(Braised Pork Belly).  As a Shanghainese restaurant, their dumplings were pretty terrible.  The meat was dry & flavorless, and the soup that I looked forward to slurping was also bland. The scallion pancakes were abysmal- the scallions seemed to have gone home for the day.  The heavy batter was ladled too thick, causing the chef to overcompensate on cook time.  The excessive oil didn't help its case.  This was the hardest item to eat. The one item we were recommended, the pork belly, was above average.  After the first two items, I was expecting more of the same, but this item earned them the extra star.  The pork was nice and tender, and drizzled in the right amount of sauce.  There were a few mushrooms/vegetables that accompanied this dish along with steamed buns to wrap the meat in.  Because it is comprised of 50% percent fatty meat, I'd recommend at least 5 to share this dish; indulging in too much of this can feel sickeningly gluttonous. Overall, I would not return here for my Shanghainese food fix.
Can't love more about this place! Yummy food, good quality, and good service at a fair price. Most dishes are very tasty yet some are debatable. If you go with Yelp/waiters recommendation for dishes, I'm pretty sure you will enjoy the food. In addition to good food, drinks are great too! Bubble tea and fresh coconut water are both my favorites! Yummy dishes: roti canal, hainanese chicken, spawns in coconut sauce, chicken broth rice, fish dishes, spinach/watercress in bean curd sauce. I'm a frequent visitor of this place.
It was a Friday afternoon when we walked in being the first guests of the day. The restaurant is large, well decorated, very modern and just straight out beautiful. Service was prompt and our waitress did a great job of going over the menu in detail. I'm kicking myself for forgetting the name however there is a margarita drink with pomegranate. This will be one of the best things you will have in life. The food was great and decently portioned. I had the eggplant   Parmigiana which was perfect, better than my own I sadly admit lol. The misses had the pollo alla Milanese which was hands down the juiciest chicken breast I had. Her mom had Filei which was mouthwatering. Safe to say we will return and soon.
Pretentious... you know who I am Daniella. Never coming back. I know you don't care how much of a regular I am. I've been rejected before by your establishment and more than once, that isn't the issue.... because I understand industry. You didn't have to be rude, insulting, or over bearing. Come to terms for one damn moment, I spent 20 dollars on a taxi to get to employees only, 20 dollars which i had to work hard for, 20= about 18-30 drinks made in my neighborhood if you want to talk about industry . Deliver your rejection in a more understanding light... considering it's industry night... Never coming back Daniella. Piss off. Been coming here for a while now. I don't like where the establishment is heading.  Every other popular place has a waitlist... hence people will WAIT to come to your bar, humble yourselves for a second... I am from industry and I was told I wasn't able to come in tonight because it's an industry night.... ??? I've paid nothing but homage and mad amounts of respect and gracious tips when I come here. As a bartender, I am disappointed and sad. Dead to me.
Mekelburg's is the worst. I've eaten here twice and have tried shopping here on a few occasions because it's close to my apartment, but this place is such a rip off. The first time I ate here, my husband and I took some family friends. We thought it'd be low-key and affordable because it's SELF-SERVICE SANDWICHES and BEER in the BACK OF A GROCERY STORE. Excuse the caps but this experience was traumatic. We were astounded that after two tiny sandwiches, served in baskets with no sides, and two beers a piece, our bill was over $80. And I was still hungry! We walked home feeling like total clowns.  The food is literally not worth it, it's really nothing special. Save your money and time-- go somewhere that tries a little harder and isn't trying to rob its patrons blind.
Yummy food & reasonable prices for the neighborhood, but what's up with the service? 3pm on a Sunday: 4 staff members behind the counter, no customers in sight. I was greeted by ... no one. After realizing there's no menu on the overhead board/space, I managed to find a stack by the cashier. I was visibly a first-timer and seeking some orientation, but it wasn't until I explicitly asked that the cashier recommended a couple of the most expensive items. I hesitated, so she recommended the Falfilu platter for its smaller size: a hummus plate with 5 falafels. Later, another staff handed me the to-go order. She called out my name, but didn't make eye contact or bother to say anything. Odd. Oh well, at least the food was satisfying: a tad greasy, but I now have enough leftover hummus to last me a week.
Excellent atmosphere and service.  The food was delicious, southern and not to oily. Highly recommended!
What a disappointment. We called ahead to see if we could get a reservation. They don't take reservations on the weekend but told us there wasn't a wait then and to come now. We showed up 15 minutes later and they told us there was a 30 minute wait! We where finally seated and the waitress took 10 minutes to come over and take our order. She was really nice but was too busy and just didn't have time to get to us. Our food took forever to come and when it finally did, frankly, it wasn't good. We will not be returning or recommending to our out of town guests. Loeb needs to step up the service game!
My boyfriend and I went to Thursday Kitchen last week for date night, and we were not disappointed! For starters, the wait staff was super attentive. Our water glasses were refilled every 3-5 minutes (or when empty) and they constantly came up to check on how we were doing. They were also super knowledgeable and up-to-date with the menu, which was awesome. But the FOOD. Each plate is the perfect sharing size and absolutely delicious. We ended up ordering the soft shell crab, which came with a side of sliced tomatoes and an aioli sauce, and the Korean seafood pancake, which came with a side of ponzu dipping sauce. Both were absolutely phenomenal. We had to wait about five-ish minutes between courses while everyone around us was getting their food, which was a bummer, but the quality was worth the wait. The ambiance is also super conducive for date night. Although small (larger people will need to squeeze between the tables), it's an intimate, dimly lit place. Absolutely gorgeous! We'll absolutely be back (and this time realize it's a tapas bar, because they didn't make that quite so obvious on their website).
The tang bao, what I know as xiao long bao, are authentically fantastic!  We decided to get takeout because it was late and the restaurant closes up slightly earlier than advertised  Though the signature dish was great, the noodle soup is not.  Interior is quite modern looking, and they sell their own merch.  Interesting place to try for dinner.
I'm giving three stars for the food and 1 star for the service. The service was god awful, after a long day it was disappointing to feel as though we were inconveniencing the waiter by being there .  This place is really small, and the tables are spaced very closely together so you better hope your neighbors are having an interesting conversation.  I ordered a skim latte, but they don't have skim milk..so instead I opted for a diet coke.  Our server was Brett, he was too busy chatting with a woman sitting at the bar near the door.. To pay any attention to empty glasses, missing silverware and to bring us the check once we asked for it. I ordered the hanger steak sandwich, with potatoes and a salad. The potatoes were friend but good, salad was average, my steak was salty, way overcooked (well done/med when I asked for it med rare ) not an ounce of pink to be seen in the meat! I'm pretty sure it was 17 dollars and it was filled with gristle... How unappealing!! My mom had the cilantro eggs with potatoes, pita and roasted veggies. She was fairly happy with-the dish.  But also appalled at the service.   We had to ask twice for the check, ask for water refills , and diet coke refills, and more napkins... Maybe we could find a better time to come that doesn't inconvenience him.  Needless to say, I won't be returning !
"Scenario: 9:30am Saturday morning, 2 friends and a puppy - half of the outdoor seats are already taken, however no one is inside with the exception of what looks to be the bartender and a barista behind the bar, and a host/server at the back busy at the register.  I walk in and get a one-over from the bartender and the barista, as if I have interrupted, but no greeting. Okaaayyy, weird but, politely I approach, cause maybe I'm not supposed to be inside? ""Hi, should I check in with you guys to grab a table outside or should I wait for the host?"" Barista, flatly: ""You can wait for her."" Continues talking to the bartender.  The host is taking quite some time at the register - so I am just standing there, waiting patiently. No attempt is made to maybe grab your co-workers attention to let her know someone is at the front, or perhaps give her a hand and say something along the lines of, ""I can seat you"" or maybe ""she might be a few minutes""..... or even ""why are you standing here, get out."" Anything would have been better to progress the situation instead of shooting side-eye while you continue your conversation...I felt so incredibly unwelcome. One star. I realize everyone has an off day (additional star for the several times I've been before and have always experienced great service and food). So disappointed. I walked out and had a lovely breakfast elsewhere. But I'm not too sure I'll be back anytime soon."
Opened up my fancy packed fish, but it stunk!!!! Seriously, Eataly?  Life lesson- smell your fish before purchasing! No matter where you buy it!!
Crawfish Party!!! The Boil is a lot of fun to take your friends or staring at your date while sucking brains out of a crawfish head. This is a simple menu, your choice of appetizers and side dishes, choose your combination of seafood (crawfish, lobsters, shrimp, Dungeness crab) with the spice of your choosing, put on your gloves and begin ripping shells open. We had the Gumbo, catfish sliders, and a pound of shrimp and crawfish.  We asked for corn on the cob and potatoes to go with our seafood. The seafood is freshly prepared once you order so we had enough time to chow down on our appetizers, the Gumbo tasted home cooked and packed with seafood flavor.  The catfish sliders were actually the highlight of my meal and perfect for sharing between 3 people. The seafood comes in its own plastic bag, the shrimp and crawfish combo was a good pairing and really filled up a table of 2. Great spot for a fun night.
Must've been living under a rock for the last few years and I had heard of eataly but thought it was just some Italian restaurant. Came here for sweet snack and went to the Nutella cafe bc least crowded. I think if this place was less hectic and I had time it might be interesting to wander around. Hearteningly we heard Italians conversing inside and I wondered why would Italians come here? The hub likened it to my going to H Mart. I'm not sure that's quite the right metaphor but I accepted it. Not sure what I would come here to do. Maybe to eat charcuterie (but the Italian equivalent - sorry I'm so uncultured)? I think I'm getting too old and too much of a country bumpkin to enjoy crowds even if it's trendy or cool. Oops forgot to review what we ate. Had a nunu which is some Nutella sponge cake which was good but sweet and an afogato which maybe was too much gelato (2 scoops) compared to amount of espresso. Some shortbread cookie with Nutella. And my friend had some milk with whipped cream and Nutella which sounded yummy on the menu but in reality maybe was too milky and creamy and messy.
Bookmarked this place for some time now and finally got to cross it off my list of places to try when visiting my sister in NYC. The wait can be anywhere from 10-60 minutes depending on the date and time you walk into the restaurant. We were pretty lucky because we came in right before the dinner rush and only waited about 25 minutes maybe 30.  Once we were seated we browsed the menu and to my surprise it was very simple. We opted to go for a few lobster rolls and a burger to try. SAMURAI LOBSTER ROLL $20 lobster that is dressed with ginger mayo, cucumbers, togarashi, sesame comes with a side salad and fries. ORIGINAL LOBSTER ROLL $20 lobster tossed in Japanese mayo and chives served with fries and a side salad. ORIGINAL BURGER $20 10oz of beef, bacon, cheese, lettuce with a side of fries and a side salad. Holy macaroni this place is yummy. Lobster Rolls were flaky, buttery, and crispy on the outside and fully loaded with lobster on the inside. All lobster rolls came with fries and a side salad. burgers were cooked to perfection and juicy with a crispy seed bun. Also came with fries and a side salad.  Thought this place was going to be all hype and touristy... but I was pretty impressed. Casual type setting with a large bar and large dining area. Bathrooms are located both downstairs as well as in the corner of the restaurant. Wouldn't mind coming back to try out more items on their menu
3.5.  Wife and I came for dinner and decided to share a lot of plates.  - Caprese - Great tomatoes but burrata wasn't as creamy as I prefer. Have had better caprese's at other Batali spots.  - Octopus - I like my octopus snappy and a little firm. Flavor was fine but the octopus was incredibly soft.  - Bolognese and Bucatini all'Amatriciana - Both of the pastas were the highlights. Guanciale was a little hidden in the bucatini.  - Lamb Chops - So this is when we decided we ordered too much food. Perfectly cooked. wold go with a different main next time.  The meal here didn't quite live up to expectations. I think the pasta tasting would be the choice if I ever came back. Service was very good from everyone but our waiter who was a bit slow.  $190 out the door for the above + a glass of wine and a beer.
This was a good spot to good to, but can't say that anymore with my recent experience. Being the only Asians in the restaurant, my girlfriend and I were forced to sit in front of the bathroom while other tables were available. Our server, Senesa, took her time in getting our menus, and didn't bother to give us any water - we had to ask the busboy to help.  The thing that really got to me was that it took over 25 mins to get our food - a Cuban sandwich and eggs with beans. The table - a Caucasian couple - that came after we got our food order the same Cuban AND the corn. They got their food within 5 minutes. When I voiced my issues with the wait staff, I was brushed aside for voicing any displeasure.  The only conclusion I can make is either they ran out of eggs - doubtful, or most likely, we were discriminated against. NEVER COMING BACK.
Hands down one of the best Italian places I've been. I ordered the squid noodle and seafood filled with squid, muscles and shrimp. It was juicy and everything was simmered accordingly. The waiters were also very friendly which made the experience very nice.
Very average.  Unfortunately came for NYE - paid $125 per person for very mediocre food.  Had Arctic char tataki, risotto, filet minion, and chocolate soufflé.  Chocolate soufflé was good, but I don't think I've ever met a bad chocolate soufflé.  Arctic char tasted a bit fishy; risotto was horribly bland and not cooked enough; and filet minion was very overcooked.  My fiancé and I ordered medium and medium rare, respectively, but we both got very well done steaks.  I'd never come back for dinner.  Felt like a diner.  I might come back for brunch if someone asked me to, but I'd never suggest or recommend this place.
What a ripoff  They cut the pita in half and give you 2 falafel balls  I rather pay more and get a full pita
As I am sitting waiting for my check to arrive, I wanted to acknowledge the amazing experience I had at this restaurant.  From the bartenders and their awesome drinks, to the friendly staff (Jonathan--server upstairs when we dined here) he's been outstanding.  I've come across some unpleasant experiences while on my vacation and he was the light at the end of the tunnel for us.  Thank for being amazing.  And serving just as great food. There's a reason this place is as busy as it is!   Chicken Parm , add pasta. Amazing.  Server Jonathan. Even more amazing.   Thanks for a wonderful experience Carmines.  I'll be sure to be back.
I accompanied a friend who has been wanting to come here for a while and was quite interested myself after looking at the yelp reviews and pictures, so both my friend and I found ourselves sitting in the corner of this cafe by the magazines (which are actually up to date!) My friend and I were EXTREMELY famished, after having woken up at 4am for a free concert. Roughly around six hours later, we were able to eat our first meal of the day and for some extremely hungry people, the food was not nearly as appetizing as we thought it would be. We both ordered the egg dishes, mine with the salmon and potatoes, while hers was with the tomato sauce and cream. To my dismay, the eggs were not runny at all consequently making the dish rather dry. My friend's eggs were a little less overcooked, and only had 1 egg running out of the 6 eggs cooked for our whole meal. This makes for a very low success rate of deliciously cooked eggs... The waitress also gave us our check before we asked & was busy chatting away with the other waitresses a majority of the time.
"This is likely to be a long review, and perhaps come in installments. We visited this restaurant on a Saturday evening about a month ago (around June 1) and it made for a very memorable event - and definitely not good. The concept is farm to table, rustic setting and the reviews looked great and so we decided to give them a try for an early dinner (before a show). First the good part - our waitress was amazingly good! The OK - it is a pretty new restaurant and so the NYC sanitary rating was ""unrated"". As it turned out they got their rating the following Monday and it is a ""B"" (download the ABCeats app) with 23 violation points and 3 critical violations which makes my experience even more scary. The bad: I cut into my chicken and not only was it undercooked and bloody but blood oozed out of the chicken! I was so appalled that I took it back, told them that I was not going to eat it. A few minutes later we get a visit from the manager who started telling us that she went to culinary school (so did my wife by the way) and that it was perfectly fine to eat it that way and that it was ""more juicy"" that way. She also told me exactly which farm this chicken came from - as if it was ""sashimi grade chicken"" or something! She came back a few minutes later with a literature article she had just printed out about bloody chicken written by some one with a Ph.D. (To impress me I guess, but I have a Ph.D. - so not overly impressed). I will share the website with y'all for your reading pleasure: She seems to miss the point that he makes about such undercooked chicken being ""extremely unacceptable to customers because of the blood."" Thanks - never again for me - undercooked and overpriced!! I posted a pic of the bloody chicken they served me, but apparently Yelp is now censoring what pictures you can post - so unfortunately it was deleted.  Luckily the article the manager gave me (link above) shows exactly what such undercooked chicken looks like, and mine looked very similar - in living color - yuk!!!!"
I bookmarked this place long ago and finally got to try it! The food was delicious and as for the service, the employees made us feel very welcome and comfortable. Thumbs up for the free Thai iced tea!
Only Roberta's can be busy on a Sunday at 4 PM in the afternoon. Luckily for us, there were a lot of people but just enough that we could get a seat quickly. My friend and I sat down quickly but had to wait a tiny bit before our server came by. Our server was SUPER great and friendly.  My friend and I ordered the Beastmaster, because we love meat. We devoured it in a span of 15 minutes between the two of us.  Also, they play HELLA good music. You can't go wrong here.
Super friendly staffs and very attractive. Order hiyashi ramen and Cold tofu. My ramen was served cold, mix veggie, egg and pork. Their special sauce is to die for. Don't know about other ramen yet but next times.
I will start with the positive..the linguini, wine, and beer were good.  My problem is the full portion of the pasta felt like a ration for the amount of money being charged.  And also, I made a reservation on open table which I had confirmed via email and they could not find it in their system.  Now, I know we live in the age of always having our phones on us, but if I did not have mine on me I would not have been able to prove I had a reservation.  I think that is a rough way to start off a dining experience.  And yes, they did give me table but I just do not like starting off a new dining  experience like that.  The dips for the shared option were pretty good...though I was not that crazy about the chips they were served with. Overall the place and feel is lackluster and not that special.
Bea is only blocks away from my home and has been on my list for a long time. However after I tried it today, I was left a bit underwhelmed. True that it has a live band, true that it has a pretty good bottom-less brunch deal, true that the vibe was great; yet felt to me that the whole place was very unorganized, even a bit chaotic. Food itself was impeccable - baked scrambled egg was soft yet chewy; the taco underneath our tuna has a real crunchy texture, and paired itself perfectly with the well-marinated tuna meat; really loved the dates added into our pear salad, the slight touch of sweetness on top of the savory flavor was nothing but the best. While there was nothing to complain about the food, everything was extremely slow and size was remarkably small - so make sure to order everything even before seated, hmm probably double the order.  Well I probably would not return, as after my brunch, I started to feel a bit of headache caused by the chaos inside the restaurant. Would not say anything bad, but this is probably not my type...skip...
"Good (not great) food with lousy and rude service. For a cozy, frenchy, ""cafe"" environment, where you'd think it be a great place to catch up with friends over dinner... It's not. Why? Because the blonde waitress waiting on our table was very rushing and rude. She gave us cold looks and a bad attitude. And after we were finished with our meal, she immediately starting cleaning our table, reaching over us and blocking conversations. We felt rushed out. Don't call yourself a cafe if you're just trying to turn over quickly. The worst part is (which I would deem this rushing more acceptable) is that there was no one waiting!! No one waiting for a table. Seriously. This really dampened the dinner experience especially when there was no reason for the waitress to be like that. Maybe she was having a bad day but still, you're in the service industry! And charging a mandatory 20% service charge for lousy service. Not okay. As for the food, I got the chicken satay. It was good, not great or anything I'd consider coming back for. My friends got the couscous and salmon pot pie. They said it was good but not impressive. Sorry, not coming back."
My friend brought me here once before and again today for my birthday. The best, nothing beats this place I love it! Summer with crawfish, what goes better!!! I can't wait to come again, I think I have to make this a once a week thing...it doesn't come cheap but worth every penny (cash only)
This little restaurant is a few blocks away from our apartment here in New York. After a long flight here, my family and I were craving something Asian, and decided to give this place a try.  The staff here are all very friendly, nothing much to note. The interior of the restaurant looks very traditional (i.e. Japanese cloths on the wall, etc) and the whole restaurant gave off a good vibe. One thing I was surprised about was how hot the interior of the restaurant was. There was an open kitchen (no door separating the kitchen from the restaurant) and it made the whole place very warm.  I got the spicy vegetarian ramen, which was V-2 (mushroom broth instead of chicken broth, with assorted vegetables). As a vegetarian ramen dish, it tasted nothing like ramen. The noodles used for this dish was different from all the other ramen dishes (used rice noodles(?) instead of the traditional egg noodles), which made it taste like hot soba. Also, the spicy sauce they used was very peppery, and only slightly spicy. The vegetables used in the dish was sliced bell peppers, ice berg lettuce, one slice of avocado, and a few mushrooms (and I ordered corn with it). Overall as a vegetarian dish, it was not my favorite. I would have preferred more traditional Japanese vegetables (instead of more American vegetables), and a different type of noodle.  The restaurant was cute, but I'll be looking elsewhere for my vegetarian ramen fix.
"So excited to have a Thai place open here. I wish them the best of luck! My friend and I had the red curry with shrimp and the pad thai with chicken. Both were delicious and super fresh, I'd happily have either again. (Though the serving of rice with the curry was really, really small.)  My only challenge is that I have celiac, so am allergic to gluten. (Serious health issue. Not a ""lifestyle"" choice.)  I had to explain to the super-busy server that I can't have soy sauce, flour, wheat - which always makes me nervous. I was pretty sure I could have curry, but she made the effort and checked with the kitchen, but I LOVE it when restaurants are confident about what I can or cannot have, what can be modified, etc. I can relax, enjoy my meal and know I will not get sick vs. just hope for the best. I live nearby and love Thai food, and regularly patronize places that can accommodate gluten-free, so encourage them to train staff or note food allergies on the menu. (gluten, veg, dairy, etc.)  I'll definitely be back. Great food! The pad thai alone will make me a regular, I just love other options."
"so disappointed, heard amazing things about this spot and been passing it all summer. it didn't deliver. the salad had the ends in it, the pieces you're supposed to remove while cutting! the ""dressing"" was all vinegar, i basically ate half an avocado for dinner. the calamari would have been good if they gave us more than a child's portion. no one asked if we wanted more drinks, quite inattentive staff. the pasta with truffles was a big draw and unfortunately, the truffles tasted like paper, the pasta was again, child's portion and we are leaving starving and confused, how is this place packed full??"
We came here around 9pm with a reservation and were seated right away. We probably didn't need a reservation as there were a lot of empty seats. I ordered the kinky boots which was a little sour and not too sweet. For food, we got the seared tuna, the Brussels sprouts, the dry rub wings and the buffalo spring rolls. The tuna was nothing special, the sauce on it just tasted like the same sweet sauce they put on top of sushi rolls. The brussel sprouts were unexpected--the salad was in mixed with a creamy dressing/sauce and had potatoes mixed in. The wings were under salted but were fine when dipped in the buffalo sauce, but that felt like an unnecessary step. The buffalo spring rolls I would probably pass on too because they hardly had a buffalo taste. All in all, a disappointing experience.
We had a large group and it was first come, first serve to be seated. It was pretty packed on a Saturday night. Eager to eat mountains of seafood, the dishes did not take long to come, but quality wise, I would say it was pretty poor.  It really honestly sucks when you can cook better at home and can get A LOT better quality and quantity. We split the Joe V's Divers Feast and pretty much everything was overcooked, especially the scallops and shrimp. The flavor of the breaded clams could have been a lot better. Oddly enough, I probably liked the side pasta the most. The New England clam chowder was decent too. Complimentary garlic bread was also good, but got a bit too salty. I'm really not sure if it was just our Divers feast because others seemed to really enjoy theirs. I also tried a raw clam and it had a fishy finish. Really not fresh. It was interesting for a first experience, but I would not come back, especially it being so far!
My fiancé and I went to El Mate for dinner after traveling from Staten Island. I've never been there before so I read the reviews and decided to go. We had the calamari which was bland very bland and extremely small pieces. As we were sitting in the backyard dining area preparing to eat our main course, there is a rat running around. I should have just left but instead we finished our dinner inside. I called the restaurant the next day to voice my concern and horrible experience. I asked to speak with the manager and the man said that he is the manager and remembered my fiancé and I. I asked if he was there the night prior and his reply was yes. So I asked why did you not come and personally apologize, the manager said it was out of his control and the rat could have come from anywhere and had it been inside the restaurant then he would have addressed it. Now he did apologize but I WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE despite what the other reviews say. EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK!
I went here last Friday night and after I ordered a drink I gave the bartender my card. He told me it was a $15 minimum so I said I would either get another drink later or pay in cash. I ended up paying in cash, but the bartender still charged my credit card (obviously I didn't see this charge until the next day). I tried working with management to get my money back (because spending nearly $20 on a captain and ginger ale is ridiculous) but they could only offer cash - which I suppose is 'nice' of them after overcharging me, but I don't live in Queens, I was visiting for the weekend.
Noel made our night....service was fantastic! We had pepper and mac & cheese, the food was great!
Two words: GRILLED CORN. Just get it, don't question it. You will not regret it, I promise. Coated with chili powder, lime, and cheese, this corn on the cob is SO good. Yes, it's messy, but that's part of the fun. They even have a takeout option adjacent to the sit down restaurant so order some corn to go and eat it outside while people watching! Such a treat.
Given the high Yelp reviews, I was actually pretty surprised by how mediocre the food tasted here. Maybe it's cause I'm from SF where this concept of farm fresh organic ingredients in food is really big, so there are lots of better options. I came with my bf for dinner. Since we didn't have reservations, we decided to show up right when dinner time started. They seated us at high stool tables near the bar rather than in the back, which looked really pretty/romantic. We didn't really mind and were just happy to get a table. For entrees we decided to try the sea bass and mushroom pizza based on reviews and our server's recommendations. Both were meh, though I think the pizza was better. The bass was TINY and honestly was not cooked so well. It was a bit overdone for me and I'm not surprised since it seemed like they basically boiled it in broth. The flavors were so simple and too basic for $32 - I think basically lemon and garlic. I'm a small person and I probably could've eaten two orders of the fish and still be hungry. The mushroom pizza was a good idea because without it we'd probably leave with half empty stomachs. It was pretty big and came with tons of mushroom. The egg sounded good on paper but was really tiny and maybe one slice got 90% of the yolk.  The serve free sourdough bread here, which tasted stale. Not great but we ate a lot of it since the entrees were disappointing and not filling. I'd recommend passing and taking your money elsewhere for higher value & better tasting food.
I've ordered from here a few times. I never sat inside so I can't comment on that too much. Butttt, the pizza is to die for! I love that it isn't the typical round pizza. There is a lot of crust so if you aren't a fan of bread or crust, it might not be the best for you. The sauce they use is very tasty and they are cheap with the sauce or cheese either. I got a pepperoni and jalapeno pizza and it changed my life. It wasn't very greasy which I enjoyed because I hate when greasy drips from the slice. It is pricey for pizza considering there are a million and one places to get pizza from but it is well worth it! I truly enjoy a good pie, and this is one.
Super into this place! The wait was long (luckily it was only 2 of us so it was 45 min on a random night but at least it was accurate). The spot is pretty small and I don't believe they take reservations so it makes sense! Would not recommend coming here with a group!  We got the Truffle mac and cheese (asked for without the clams, which they kindly pointed out just to make sure we had noticed and offered to make it without if we wanted, which we chose to do). It was super heavy but such amazing taste! Would definitely get that again.  We got the watermelon salad as well, which was a great combo of flavors and a good size.  The avocado dish was beautifully presented and had great flavor as well. The beets were a really interesting addition but we loved it!  The last thing we got was new to the menu and was a plantain dish. LOVED it. Really well done.  I really appreciated the waitress explaining everything thoroughly while serving - since they are unique dishes, knowing that she knew the menu well and was able to explain what we were about to eat was helpful. Because we ordered something new on the menu, a few people came to check and see what we thought, which was great. We were super impressed! Service was also extremely quick despite everything being super busy. Wait staff was friendly and attentive for sure. Would definitely come back but would probably skip the drinks and spend more money on food!
This place was recommended to me as the best Greek restaurant in Astoria, and I'm willing to go on a limb after my first experience and agree that yes it is! We went on Saturday at 4pm. Even at that time there was a small (10min-ish) wait, but that could have been because we wanted patio seating. Just as a point of reference, when we left at 6:30pm, the block was filled with people waiting to get in. The staff was bringing them small complimentary glasses of wine. What amazing hospitality! I'm just getting used to the fact that Greek restaurants in NY actually have Greek Staff, which is super exciting to someone whose learning and/or is obsessed with Greece (*raises hand*). The waiters and hostess were super friendly, and the food was fantastic. I haven't had dolmades that tasted like that anywhere but Greece. The grilled octopus was pretty good--very good by most standards--but there was one other place in manhattan that had a better one. Otherwise, all the food we had was delicious, and so much more reasonably priced than what we'd just seen in the city. If I lived New York, this place would be my go-to!
"This place gets stars because they have $1.00 oysters that always taste fresh and they also offer west coast. You can't beat that. Everyday! We love it! I subtracted 2 stars because we are never thrilled with the other dishes. And we learned its best to just stick with oysters here!! Just being honest. We've tried the escargots-  I've had really delicious escargots before. We couldn't even eat the ones they served us! There was so much oil first of all. Second, the snails just looked so unappetizing.  Some of them were so large and it just turned me off. They were rubbery and seemed like they were from a can or something.  We also tried the mussels which were pretty good. But some of them tasted like they were cooked dead.(mussels should be cooked while alive with the shell closed) so that kinda grossed me out! I also tried a bloody Mary and it tasted like straight up horseradish. It was so overwhelming that I couldn't finish the drink. The service here is a little shaky. We came in around 430 on Sunday and we wanted to order oysters. We were told that oysters aren't served until 5 o'clock and we would have to wait for the dinner service. Which was totally fine. But the server just kept telling us he was waiting for the dinner menus to or it would cause ""mass chaos"" if we ordered before brunch was over. We didn't end up ordering the oysters until 540 so we went almost an hour just sitting there ."
Ambiance was great, food was good. But the service was a bit slow and our server looked quite messy. We ordered Berkshire pork belly and their Totto special garlic and chicken skin skewer. The pork belly was delicious. The Totto special was good when you first bite into it because it was so flavorful. But once you get to the garlic, it tasted like nothing. My friend ordered a hot soba with duck and I ordered cold ikura soba. My soba was good but the dipping sauce was on the saltier side. My friend said her duck and soba was very bland. I would return again to try their other foods.
I ve been ordering delivery from this place since I can remember, food is good and tasty, I've never really hot disappointed, the peanut butter pie is to die for !
"A Spanish restaurant sucking the joy out of food? Can you imagine! First mistake: coming back here with an actual Spaniard. Second mistake: ordering randomly, including getting a mediocre thing I'd cautioned Yelp At Large against ordering in my previous review. (FYI, the quality of bread here has not improved.) Third mistake: not getting sloshed on sangria, probably, as the disappointment of the food was laid bare in its full glory. I remembered Las Ramblas as a charming, ""summertime evening"" spot, but we were so very disappointed. The menu hasn't changed, apparently, in years. The sardinas en escabeche were neither very tasty nor really ""escabeche."" For having picked through a million pinbones, the actual fish wasn't rewarding at all and just tasted dead. The jamon serrano with idiazabal was still average, with very ""meh"" bread. Hard as I try, I have no memory of what else we ordered. Nothing tasted GOOD - literally nothing. Service was strange - there was one cheerful waitress, but our server did not smile or so much as move his eyebrows when making eye contact. He just seemed angry and indifferent. He even seemed angry when we gently asked for water a second time after no water had come. It was one of those very rare but frustrating meals where eating is like a chore, and you leave after 30 minutes because there's no point in being there anymore."
Set my birthday brunch reservation about 3 weeks in advance for a party of ten at 12PM on a Saturday.  When the day comes, we're all running late (which we understand is our fault). The hostess and our waiter kept reminding us that we only have until 2PM to sit at our table (which we already knew since the day I made the reservation). I didn't mind the reminder because I figured they were trying to help us out but they at least reminded us 6 times that we had to leave at 2. We understood that we arrived late, so our time was going to be limited but we all felt very rushed.  The waiter served a sangria to one of my friends and then had the nerve to come ID us AFTER he gave her the drink. We were all over 21 and were aware that we had to be of legal age to drink. But no, we were treated like children which led us to have an unpleasant experience. Asides from that, I ordered the Vaca Frita with a side of yuca fries and it was delicious. The food honestly made my day. The sangrias? I had the Spanish Harlem, Punta Cana and a few other white sangrias. They were good but they could've been a bit stronger. But looking at the menu (and hearing from our waiter), if any person in your party gets too drunk, the whole party will be asked to leave. Interesting. Anyway, I'm not suprised for this restaurant is rather upscale. Will I return? Maybe for an intimate date night.
Lunch review: we came for a coworker's birthday lunch and I wasn't impressed. There was a small hair in my dish (they're B rated, too)-- I didn't say anything because I didn't want to upset the birthday girl, but aside from that- I ordered the lunch veggie omelette with a side salad. It was flavorful, but not filling at all. I also had an iced tea that was good but very small. I'm happy to pay for really good food in small quantities, but this didn't cut it for me. They also include gratuity, but didn't tell us that gratuity was included.  On a positive: my friends enjoyed their meals-- though they forgot the avocado in the chicken sandwich and had to bring it on the side. The space is really open & airy. The vibe is great for conversation.   I really wanted to like this place more than I did.
Such a beautiful restaurant; Love the gold leaf decor so much.  For appetizers we ordered: -Kao Tang Na Tung (rice cracker w/ minced shrimp, pork, crab meat, coconut milk & lemon grass)  -Ray Rai Nah Phu (minced shrimp, rice noodles, curry paste wrapped in betel leaves & topped with  crab meat  Entrees: -Royal pad thai -red curry -special duck dish that was recommended by our waitress  Presentation with each dish was nicely done & the dishes were flavorful and had great spice. I didn't care too much for the appetizers but I enjoyed the pad Thai, curry, & duck entrees greatly.  We also ordered a Thai iced tea and ended up getting a 2nd thai tea each because we enjoyed it so much & it was perfectly refreshing to have with our spicy food.
I've literally been here at least once a week since this place opened. I've never had a better taco in my life and I've tried tacos from Mexico, my dude! The carne asada tacos are always bomb and juicy and their hot sauces are serious. I typically come here for dinner because their lunch lines are out the door. See you guys tonight!
Came here the other night for a team dinner and was very impressed. the decor of the restaurant is very unique and nothing like I've seen before. in terms of the food, thankfully I had a chance to try a variety of their dishes. the highlights were definitely the ricotta cheese/bread, the crab toast, the sashimi, mushroom/egg pizza, and pork confit,  however pretty much everything was really good. definitely would come back here again and would recommend to anyone in the area!
One of the best places I have in a while. The service was great, price very affordable and food delicious... the egg Benedicts were delicious. Also, the place makes you comfortable.
I've had Los Tacos before at their Meatpacking District location, so I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon this location in Times Square. Unlike the Meatpacking District location, this location has limited seating aside from several tables and a standing area alongside the windows. The orderly process can get quite hectic here. You order at the register once you walk in and you'll receive a receipt after doing so. You then hand that receipt over to the taco-preppers and they'll make your order for you.  I settled for one of each taco that they offered. The pork, steak, chicken tacos were all delicious. I felt indifferent about the grilled cactus taco since it didn't really have any taste to it. It was worth a try though.  I'd recommend grabbing a stack of tissues since eating these tacos can get quite messy as the juice from the meats would often leak from the tortillas. The venue also offers condiments for your tacos such as limes, peppers and mild and spicy salsas.
"Disappointed  Came on a Wednesday night. What was with the crazy death metal music!? Relatively full but still able to snag a table. The bartender poured my friend a glass of wine, little over 1/4 the glass, why so stingy?  The food was.... Okay.  Pork belly was fine, nothing to write home about I did like whole hog but I found the serving size a bit small.  The apple slaw and corn bread was good.  The Mac and cheese and waffle sweet potato Was Pretty dry and hard.   Considering the hype, the wait for this place to open, all this "" studying"" Tyson did down south on southern bbq. Better off at fettle sau."
Went here a couple weekends back and it was pretty mediocre. Had the Porgy Ssam and the Duck Entree. The Porgy was nice a concept, light and healthyish, but 40something bucks was a rip-off for the amount of fish served. We also had an heirloom tomato app which was the highlight, but again not much cooking involved(though it was a nice dashi broth). As for the duck, this was very disappointing given how much I love their rotisserie duck. It was way too rare, which could work, if they bothered to render out the fat from the skin, which was rubbery. Momofuku has become a mile wide and an inch deep these days. I would maybe go back for one of the larger format feasts. The rib eye looked tasty while there and I've wanted to try the duck, but otherwise the place is on the outs for me.
Huge crowd on a Saturday afternoon, but we were intent on trying this spot. Put our name down and enjoyed the day outside until we got the text to come back (more places should do this). Obviously crowded inside, so expect to get cozy with your neighbors. Looking over the menu, was not going to get the brunch cocktails as they're overpriced. After realizing they don't serve their chicken for brunch (WHY), settled on the Fried Pork Chop w/cheddar waffles ($17) and a side of biscuits ($5). The fried pork chop is well breaded, a bit oily, yet substantial. The cheddar waffles pack a punch - crisp, filling, though a bit on the salty end (best eaten with a sauce). The biscuits are super fluffy; presented with jelly and butter that goes altogether well. To wash it down, ordered an overpriced orange juice ($4) - why is every drink here so expensive? Service here is efficient considering the crowds they have to deal with. I did enjoy my meal, but found the price point to be higher than it should be, especially for drinks. Still, I'd want to come back to try the chicken - 3.5 stars.
I met my crew here for our bimonthly round table discussions.  We'd looked at several places and eventually settled on this one because it was near some of the other activities we were considering that day.  It seems the stars aligned for us.   Before you even enter the restaurant, feast your eyes on the massive, imposing super structure of the Manhattan Bridge. (Do it for the snap maybe?).  The main floor is pretty wide and has a cutaway view to the kitchen. It's also got this awesome looking greenery along one wall and some elevated table seating.   We arrived on time and were seated on the upper level overlooking the main floor and its beautiful vertical garden. Just behind our table was a wall full of cases of wine bottles which perfectly complemented the wood aesthetic elements.  We didn't sample the lunch fare but instead went with brunch.  I had the steak with scrambled eggs (I can't do eggs Benedict or sunny side up. Don't ask me why). Everything was awesome!   Definitely put this place on your list if you'll be in the Dumbo/Brooklyn/Manhattan Bridge area.  Just know that it's a little bit of a walk from the A,F,2 or 3 trains
"Came here for quick brunch on my way to the 911 museum, saw the menu was pretty interesting so decided to give it a try.  My husband ordered the donut with fried chicken and I got the shrimp and avocado toast.  The food was ok, my toast was bland while the fried chicken donut was pretty good but our waitress was just so bad.. She was very slow and snappy and had an attitude.  For example we waited awhile for the cold brew coffee so we asked her just in case she forgot, she returned with an attitude and said ""like i said, i will bring it over when its ready"".  Not sure what is her problem but we wont be back."
"Came here for brunch and had a solid meal. Bottomless mimosas (4 diff flavors!) for 15 bucks was a steal.  The khao soi, hash (with a side of garlic rice), pancake thing, and chocolate/bacon pudding were all tasty. I still can't get over khao soi (or any thai food) costing more than a buck (yeah yeah typical foodie snobbery--""when I lived in Bangkok""--sorry), much less 15+ dollars but at least it was delish. I think my favorite bite was actually the sausage that came on the side. So well seasoned and perfectly cooked! All in all a good brunch with great company."
Doma is a small, relatively new Korean restaurant in Sunnyside. It reminds me of the little mom and pop restaurants in Korea, only a few tables, but a large menu full of authentic homemade Korean food. We came for lunch on a Saturday and grabbed a table by the window. We decided to order the raboki, bulgogi kimbap, and meat mandu. The kimbap is super authentic; it brought me back to days in Seoul buying kimbap from street vendors. I'd come by again just for this. The mandu (dumplings) were really good too, good flavor, nothing out of the ordinary here. As per the raboki, I was not a fan, it's essentially dukboki with ramen added, but Doma has added a bunch of veggies which totally overpower the gochujang (sweet red pepper sauce). All I could taste were bell peppers and broccoli. Maybe this is a different style of dukboki that I'm not used to, but this left me disappointed. Like most Korean places the service is great, just know to call over the server if you need anything, they don't usually come over on their own like servers in American restaurants.
I have never been made to feel more uncomfortable in a restaurant. The place was empty, i was told there would be a 45 minute wait for two, but the bar was first come first serve. After scoring a seat at the bar i was promptly informed i wasnt allowed to take seats like that and that i needed to wait. Wtf. I wont be coming back and hope management gets a hold of the kind of service they are serving up here. We promptly took our business elsewhere, hostess on sunday mornings around 11:30 sucks.
"I really wanted this place to be ""my spot"". I spent several months living in Peru in 2007, so maybe my expectations were too high?  I've been here twice now, and nothing really did it for me on their menu. The pork sliders were SO salty, they were practically inedible. None of the ceviches were amazing, as some of the previous reviews would have suggested. That said, I liked the pineapple tuna more than the others I tried. The crispy oysters were really nice, but *so* expensive for basically 3 fried oysters. I think I'm going to give this place one more shot, but I might have to go alone since my boyfriend doesn't believe in 2nd chances! :)"
Brunch food was amazing however the service was just O-kay. The mac and cheese was everything while the fried chicken was probably some of the best fried chicken I've ever had NOT from home. The red velvet waffle was just okay could've done with or without it since the fried chicken was great.  Shrimp and lobster grits were pretty great as well. Will definitely be back!
I ordered take out and the order was wrong and got me sick!!!!! I called and complained and Im still waiting for my $5 refund!! The chicken made me sick!!! Do not order from here !!!
"Okay food, good service, but just an overall uncomfortable dining experience. We sat down and were seated on one of the upper levels in the back, but it was quite cold as the windows that were basically at the same elevation as our seats were open due to what the hostess described as a ""ventilation"" issue. We asked if it was possible to sit on the lower level, but the hostess claimed that it wasn't any warmer, which seemed extremely unlikely given the location of the windows, and clearly they agreed as they stopped seating people up there later on during our meal. Our server was extremely gracious and helpful in allowing us to move to seats elsewhere on the same level that were less affected by the wind, but our experience was extremely soured by that incident. Other than that, the food itself was alright. The french dips were okay, the deluxe beef much better than the lamb was (although I only realized halfway through that the mint chimichurri was on the side and not already in the sandwich), and the waffle fries that were recommended were not particularly tasty. The pull apart bread that we ordered to start was delightful though, and we took about half home to eat the following day, which still tasted quite nice. The chocolate cake dessert we had was also decent but nothing that I thought was exceptional.  Overall, it's an okay place to eat if you're around (we didn't have a reservation and only waited about 25 minutes), but the food quality combined with the experience left me waiting for Jacob's Pickles to reopen."
This is why I shouldn't have held off on reviewing places so late because Roberta's made one of my favorite pizza ever but  I recall the name of the pizza. My cousin and I shared a pizza and it's the one with the sauce and the white cheese(for pic description) and the waitress suggested to add the honey. I'm so glad that the waitress suggested it because it was honestly the best pizza I had because of it. It was so unique and it was so tasty. I don't know what it was but it really stand out in all the pizzas that I've had. I'm sorry that I can't recall the name of it but I know it's not an actual ingredient on the pizza until she offered it(as a topping).  Everything were pretty damn great in terms of food and the service was great too considering they were busy and we waited for a friend to arrive. They never push us out or anything. The only thing I would say is that I ordered their tea drink and it was TURRIBLE. That would my only complaint.
"OMG! What a let down. I walked in on a Thursday night.  Asked if they had Black Bush. The reply was ""no"". Wow the bar tender didn't even offer me an alternative.  So I ordered and vodka & tonic instead.  They took their time making it but when it arrived I thought it would have been worth the wait. WRONG! I don't think I've ever tasted a V&T so weak.  In fact I even wonder if here was any vodka in it. WTF! $14 for semi-flat tonic.  Not a good experience.  Hope they weren't pulling some black-guys-don't-tip-so-here's-a-very-watered-down-drink shit ....... cuz I do.  :( P.S. Managment got back to me and apologized.  Will do a COMPLETE re-write after I've gone back there again."
"VERY DISAPPOINTED! I come to Salud Restaurant once a month with my fiancé and today's service was terrible. There was only one server and she took more than ten minutes just to bring us menus. Afterwards she took forever to return and take our orders. It is not fair to us (the customers) to wait this long after traveling a long way to eat here. Then the server refused to add fried egg and avocado to our burgers, which we ALWAYS order. Since when can a customer not add, substitute or customize a burger order? We wanted to order drinks as well and she would not serve us the beer although we told her we would go to the car to get our IDs and be right back. Finally when we got our IDs she brought my fiancé his beers and completely forgot about mine and I had to wait another fifteen minutes. Apart from all of this, she messed up our order and brought us the wrong burgers. The server then began to rant on how she put the order in correctly and that we did not ask for said burgers, when we very well did. Later on one of our glasses broke. All of the customers stopped and stared, however none of the servers came by to help us pick the broken glass from the table. We had to pick up all the glass pieces ourselves and call the server because who knows how long until they would have acknowledged us. Finally, we were only compensated with a cocktail ""on the house"", for all of the trouble we went through. This restaurant has changed and not for the better."
I had a lot of greasy food in my life. I had a lot of curries in my life. But this was the greasiest, most bland curry I ever had. I ordered the seafood curry noodle soup. It comes in a small plastic container. There was literally 2 cm thick of oil on the top. If tiu think 2cm thick of entire oil is little, measure it with your ruler.  It wouldnt have been so bad if the broth had more flavor in it. There was no curry flavor (didn't add enough?) You would need to tell me it was curry, all I tasted was bland oil. Another thing, lack of flavor could mean they didn't add enough ingredients in it. For example they didn't add scallions, onions, garlic, lemongrass etc? I am sure in curry soups, besides curry powder and coconut milk (which this one had only a tiny hint of... Is it even supposed to be coconut milk?!) , you need other ingredients to go into the broth. Also this was lacking in sodium. I added some fish sauce which usually helps salvage most dishes because they had some flavor/ingredients and salt just brings the flavor out more. But this one, after adding fish sauce, it was still bland and flavorless. I could have added even more fish sauce. Seafood wise, it was 2-3 shrimp, 2 pieces of tough cold squid and some imitation crab.  I had high hopes for this place, but I never had anything with so much oil. Fried chicken wings surprisingly doesn't have THAT much oil, but this is x20 times the amount of oil. Heart attack full of Unnecessary amount of oil, lack of curry powder and staple ingredients in the broth. I'd like to ask the people to try this broth, this cannot be Malaysian/Singaporean curry. It cannot be this oily and bland.
I absolutely love this place. I'm originally from the south and this is the place I go when I want a taste of home. The food is amazing, so much flavor and more than generous portions for a great price. The atmosphere is very cool, great vibe, very rich in culture.
The hype is REAL and I'm a believer!!!  Came here with the wife on our first trip up to Harlem and I'm so glad we did.  I think we may have caught an odd hour between lunch/dinner because there was no wait and plenty of seats. The table corn muffins were UNREAL, I almost couldn't stop myself from finishing all of them in the basket, so moist, perfect amount of sweetness and pee-in-your-pants warm temperature -- aahhh perfect. Ordered: The Reggie Harris - Okay, so paying ~$19 for a piece of chicken seems a bit much but after tasting the moist, tender meat all thoughts of money vanished.  This was seriously the 2nd best fried chicken I've ever had and that is saying a LOT because I love my fried chicken and had my fair share only to be disappointed more often than not. The honey on it was superb and although it did start to get a bit too sweet towards the end, I regret nothing.  Also need to mention that the sides are rockstars in their own rights. Very generous portions of both Mac & Cheese and the mashed potatoes. Ugh I'm drooling just thinking about it again. If you're in Harlem and you haven't tried Amy Ruth's do yourself a favor and GO!
This place is f------- amazing. I should just end my review here. But as a yelper I will tell you the food journey I went on because it was unbelievable. A fatass journey at the very least...because Scarpetta left me speechless. I wish I lived next door that is how much love I have for this place.  Let me start by saying this place is dark and I almost tripped over my own foot if not for the dim lights to guide my way. But I digress because the food gave me a foodgasm. If that is a word, if not it should be.  This is the fatass list my girlfriend and I had: (Served complimentary of the Scarpetta: Bread Basket with stromboli and Focaccia Bread w/ three dipping sauces: Eggplant Marinara (AMAZING), Citrus Olive Oil, Butter) Braised Short Ribs w/ vegetable & farro risotto (Portion is small but short ribs were extremely tender and compliments the risotto really well) Creamy Polenta w/ fricassee of truffled mushrooms (Silky and smooth is the best way to describe this dish as the polenta is filled with flavor and the truffled mushrooms accentuates the dish.) Short Rib & Bone Marrow Agnolotti w/ garlic chip & horseradish (By far the winner of the night as it had a crunch from the garlic chips only to get hit with the succulent taste of the short rib and bone marrow all warp up. This left me speechless and I almost did not want to finish it.) Duck & Foie Gras Ravioli w/ marsala reduction (Creamy and just delightful. The dish is on the heavy side due to the Foie Gras but it just fits so well and a great lead to the entrees) Veal Tenderloin w/ sweetbreads, root vegetables & gnocchi alla romana (Soft and tender when cooked to medium rare. I could not ask for a better entree well unless they gave me two of these dishes) Limoncello Semifreddo w/ pistachio cake, macerated berries & basil-blackberry sorbet (Amazing and beautiful. Each one of the components are there to compliment the other and is meant to be eaten together. Hitting every single dessert note on my tongue) Valrhona Chocolate Cake w/ chocolate, butterscotch & caramel gelato (Sweet and bitter at the same time which left a great sensation considering we got this will the Limoncello. Layer after layer of flavor hit my tongue and I could not end this journey any other way) My girlfriend brought me to this place for my birthday and it was magical. I better up the ante at her birthday. Recommendation: Check out my list
Went in today for brunch with my girlfriend and left utterly disappointed; not only with the food but the service. Upon entering, we were seated with no menus and no water for about 10 minutes; couples that came in after us were able to put in their orders before we even got water, absolutely unacceptable. In addition to this, the servers were not only slow but rude as well. Onto the food. My girlfriend decided to get the breakfast brioche and I ordered the pulled pork eggs Benedict for myself. When the food arrived, the yolks in both our meals were fully cooked, not what we were expecting. Overall, I do not think we will be coming back to the Hole in the Wall. I suggest they provide some professional training to their waiters and find a chef that can cook an egg properly
Came in a few minutes until kitchen closed between lunch and dinner. The great customer service gives it 3 stars however the shrimp pad Thai did not have much flavor at all. It was just not great. It did not have any spices or spice to it at all
I think 'Unagi don (Una don)' is one of the most rare Japanese food in America. The traditional Una Don uses grilled eel with special BBQ sauce. Well... The Don I had at Benemon this time was a kind of mixed bowl of 'tama don (egg bowl)' and Una don so the texture changed a lot from the original.  The egg killed the taste of eel and its sauce and I was so disappointed. Actually, there was 'Una don' on the menu and it is closer to the original Japanese Una Don. However, it costed $10 more than una-tama don. Another menu I tried was Una-ten don set. Una-ten don came with typical tempura (Japanese fried things), such as shrimp ten and squash ten, and extraordinarily unusual eel tempura.  The tempura was very crispy and the sauce was not to blend. Although the food did not follow the original style and the recipe, it was such an interesting experience to have (relatively) genuine Japanese food in NYC.
The food Classic French bistro fare. Quite good. But the service? The very worst I've experienced in NYC. 40 mins wait for a cocktail, 80 mins wait for the appetizers and then after speaking with Manager we still waited another 60 mins for main courses. Not recommended.
I sing the praises of this place to anyone who listens. The name alone is enough to earn a visit. The first time I came here I was a bit skeptical about doing the chef's choice. How do they know what I would actually want to eat? Well considering everything on the menu is actually amazing, they can't go wrong. Came in here the last time for a birthday dinner with my parents who had never been before. We did the chef's selection menu which consisted of about 10 dishes not including dessert (party of 3). My mother is more of a seafood person so our server told her to pick 2 seafood options and they would make sure they were a part of the selection ( she picked the scallops and the squid with bok choy which were delicious.) Personally, the soft shell crab and the gnocchi stole the show. The crab was fresh and cooked to a delicious crisp. As a huge fan of everything carbs it's no surprise I loved the gnocchi as well.  Thanks to my mom having a cinnamon allergy, the bacon donuts were not included in the chef's selection so me and my dad got an order on top of everything. The restaurant didn't want mom to be left out so they brought her the key lime pie. All of this on top of the 2 dessert options included with the meal (which I believe means we tried every dessert on the menu that night and the bacon donuts were by far the best). Overall every visit here is a great experience. The service is great, the food is even better, and the food coma you fall into when you leave should make for an amazing night of sleep.
Every time I come here the bartenders are rude and not personable. They try to make fun of people coming in to the locals for free shots on their behalf. I would come back here if it wasn't for the shittiest service in south slope. Rude and uncomfortable vibes.
I got the pan fried hand-pulled noodles with roast pork. It was by far the best noodles that I have ever gotten in Chinatown, and the sauce/seasonings were very flavorful. However, I can't give 5 stars because 1) there was very little to no roast pork and 2) the actual roast pork wasn't anything special. It's also $8.50 which is quite pricey for a noodle dish in Chinatown. The restaurant is very tiny and crowded so I wouldn't recommend actually eating at the restaurant. The noodles are so good though that I will definitely be returning for more.
"The food was delicious!  The service on the other hand was the worst I've ever experienced in New York. Our server seemed like he wanted to be anywhere but working this eventful evening.  He rolled his eyes at us when we didn't order his suggestions, forgot to send orders to the kitchen, questioned us when we complained at the end bc it was on the bill.  Then we asked to split the bill 4 ways, clearly an error in hindsight as it took an HOUR to run the cards. Tonight I checked my statement, and they doubled charged me.  I called them to try and remedy the situation.  I was told, ""Call back in 10 minutes when the manager is in.""  I have been calling every 15 minutes for the past 2 hours and they haven't picked up the phone once. Such a shame bc I would love to go back for the atmosphere and food, but the service makes me never want to go there again"
Gorgeous, quaint space. A must visit if you're in the area. We visited Uva with friends for brunch, and settled for the brunch deal (Entre, side and drink if I remember correctly). We ordered the chocolate crepes (Omg, divine), the ortolana and the 3 scrambled eggs. Everything we ordered was spot on, and the service was great too. Uva has become one of our favorites!  Be sure to get a reservation ahead of time, the place fills up super fast.
Trash. They never delivered. Took my order z& never even told me they were not coming
Three Years later I go back to Mango Seed and it was an EPIC FAIL for me personally.... I did not enjoy the mac and cheese - it was on the overly heavy side with the cream sauce. Oxtail - it was just NOT GOOD...... I tried to dock it up with Salt and hot sauce - it was not happening..... It was just killing my taste buds..... 29 dollars later... What happened to the plantain chips and guacamole dip w/ Bacon.... what happened to the Jerk Cornish Hen..... back in 2013 the food was SO GOOD...... Currently in 2016 - I am not impressed at all..... Disappointed in my meal today. I needed some tea and there was no hot beverage available - come on Mango Seed..... (big sigh) However - my friend LOVED the fish tacos.... and I have to say the spinach was good.
The service was a bit rushed and the food itself was about average but the service was fast and the ambience was very appealing with good music and plenty of big screen tvs.  Please note they do NOT offer free refills on soda. I didn't even know that was a thing. So pace your sips and skip the cocktail. Sticking to sale is your best bet.
Perhaps the worst meal I have ever had. Extremely fishy and slimy. Liquified yams over slimy tuna and me and my girlfriend almost threw up. Appetizer was same way.  For NYC, I was disgusted.
Melba's used to be my favorite dinner and brunch spot in Harlem! Their prices were perfect, the food was deliciously seasoned and portions were big.  The wait staff has always been less than stellar but due to the portion size and how delicious the food was I gave them a pass. I can say that no longer.  It started with the price increase, which is understandable considering the rent in Harlem is only going up so you give them a pass for this. Then the food began to taste more bland with every visit. This makes it hard to over look waiting sometimes up to 35 minutes for dinner, forgotten drink orders after already waiting 30 minutes to be seated.  There seems to be a revolving door with the wait staff (no one stays more than 3-6 months) and the regulars that are there are clearly unhappy. During a very strong heat wave (92 degree days) you would think Melba's would provide AC for the customers and especially the workers but that isn't the case. Which results in slower unpleasant staff. My boyfriend and I will not be returning with the price increase and diminished quality of food.
"What a treat to end the weekend with a super tasty Italian dinner with a friend. We found ourselves Yelping for a good place near to the Botanical Gardens ($8 Uber ride, not bad) and stumbled upon this little gem.  The warm, everyone knows your name atmosphere is surely a bit to do with the charming older bartender, who smiled at my friend the whole time, and the fantastic maitre d' with great hair.  We happily flashed our Yelp check ins and were presented with two healthy pours of a Montalcino that went down super easy... Yum.  I enjoyed the stuffed mushrooms and the lamb meatballs, both of which were delicious. The lamb meatballs were so ""smooth"" for lack of a better word... Like the nicest texture and so juicy. Incredible. Our waiter proudly told us it was his recipe. Marry me.  I wish we had left room for the cannoli I saw on a plate passing by on its way to a very happy customer. Next time!"
"Dear Joes Shanghai, You just lost a loyal customer today. You have been my favorite for over 10 years. I took my family, who's never been to NY, to visit and highly recommended you. However, today's experience-  I'm highly disappointed and will never come back. Your server, who brought out the wrong food, yelled at us. Your ""Diced pork & Dry bean curd"" dish was mainly made of chicken. When pointed out, you claimed a string of pork ear was ""pork"", and that was the only pork ingredient in your diced pork dish. Although the food was incorrect, the servers attitude was the most upsetting, being yelled loudly by your server.  We won't be coming back, but as well-known as you are. I'd recommend you retrain your server so other guests won't have to experience that we went through."
Food wasn't bad. Although this place is fairly new, the decor is lacking and could be considered a hole in the wall imo. My food was surprisingly good except for the fact that they put chili peppers in my hot pot despite the fact that the menu indicated no chili pepper pic. I ordered the sate shrimp and fried egg hot pot. Hubby says sate is usually supposed to be spicy so he's not surprised. Maybe they should correct the menu then. I expected small shrimps like some cheap restaurants give u from prob those frozen/thawed package shrimps... but I was pleasantly surprised the shrimps were decent normal size with the tail pieces stuck on them--which verifies to me that that they prob aren't frozen shrimps. Hubby ordered the soy sauce chicken and fried egg hot pot. This was not spicy as expected. He enjoyed it. We also ordered the roti canai for appetizer. It was too greasy to be likable for me. Hubby says most roti's are like that. Hmmmmm, not particularly fond of it then.
Best sisig I have ever had outside of the Philippines. Love going here when in the NY area. They serve a mix of Filipino, and thai food that are always perfectly cooked.  Service is also awesome. Will come back again and again!
Food AND service were terrible. Ordered: goat neck duck and waffle Both dishes were incredibly dry. Duck was over fried This place is a rip off. Do not come here.
Great food and there are many locations around NYC! This location had way less crowds, which was nice. I got the liang pi and a can of herbal, which was just an amazing combination after a long bike ride. The liang pi itself wasn't too spicy, the noodles were chewy but the noodle/tofu ratio was too high so I found myself wanting more of the tofu. There isn't much sitting area, but that's ok since most people that came and went while I was eating ordered to go. However, the sitting area was a little dirty and I had to get a napkin to clean up my place before eating.  Overall good food, good location, just needs a bit of cleaning :)
Went for brunch with a large group. Those who orders grilled food were happy enough but those who ordered breakfast items, especially French toast and eggs Benedict, were very disappointed. My French toast was basically deep fried bread. Tasteless and worthless.  Reasonable enough in terms of price, but not worth it if you leave hungry because the food is awful.
Been meaning to try this place, being that its been recommended to me by friends on multiple occasions. Finally got to try it and was very pleased. The brisket was tender and paired very well with their signature bbq sauces (especially the Sticky sauce, could dip any bbq in it). Their jerk ribs were also tasty, but not the fall of the bone ribs i was looking forward to. Overall enjoyed the food, good beers on tap, a recommend for bbq in brooklyn for sure.
This is definitely not a gluten free friendly place. There was one only option on the brunch menu and it was $17 for 2 eggs and bacon. Service was slow and the Bloody Mary I ordered was horrible. And the waitress didn't seem to care or say anything when she took back my full drink. Don't recommend for brunch at all, no wonder it was empty.
Came here with my brother for a mid-week dinner and the place was packed! Lucily we got a table without a reservation. I had a bourbon and honey cocktail to start which was amazing.  The griddle bread was so good we had to order another one, and the labneh was a perfect dip for a change.  We ordered the cauliflower with labneh, which came with an oregano oil that left us both speechless. We shared the rabbit tacos and the lamb dumpling.  Both dishes were so delicious, and perfectly seasoned and balanced.  Definitely will come back in the summer when they have outdoor seating available.
I thought it was a pretty good brunch.  I decided to try this place because one of colleagues strongly recommended the fried chicken, stating it was better than one from root and bone in his opinion. We went for basically sunday lunch and was asked to wait for 45 minutes, but got our table in about 25 minutes.  It is a small restaurant, but there is enough space between tables so you won't feel like there is no privacy. I started with some lemonade which was not too sweet.  Then ordered chicken and waffle.  Steak and egg was ordered by my wife.  I thought the chicken was very good, well fried, but liked the waffle even more.  It was served with 3 different butter.  Waffle was perfectly baked and perfected matched with the butter.  Steak was cooked medium perfectly and paired well with egg and potato.  I also ordered bacon (was told it was thick).  It wasn't as thick as I hoped for, but still tasty without too much fat left. I thought the ambiance was very vibrant.  Overall I would definitely recommend this place for weekend brunch.
"Nothing really special, the bartender was great - a really nice kid who knew how to mix a drink - but the food (lunch) was only just better than typical bar food, but not what it's nearly hyped to be. The house specialty meatloaf was dry and bland, and as far as the big noise about the ""Great Fresh Potato Salad"", it was fresh but neither special nor great.  All in all better than the average burger and fries, but bar food it is."
Split the following with 2 friends: + eggplang chips + mac and cheese with onion rings + burger + Brussels sprouts hash The eggplant chips were definitely the best, and I liked the hash, but the other dishes fell flat for me. On top of that, the service was pretty terrible. My friend enjoyed her cocktails but we just weren't wowed by the food.
You know that the food is very good when the conversation stops. ... or, it's very spicy.... (or both) I realized this a few years back while seated at Peaches Hothouse with a few OG yelpers, and one of our friends, otherwise an entertaining  conversationalist, just stopped talking.  He had ordered the extra hot fried chicken, and while the pain wasn't enough to get him to start hallucinating, it did shut down one end. (Somewhat ironic, taking in the full picture...). Now, I used to be braver (and younger) then and so I had the audacity to ask for some hot sauce on the side as well, much to the amusement of our waitress. Bravado aside, memory suppression would likely explain why my next visit to the Hothouse took another few years... While I've been more regular since, and Peaches Hothouse shows no sign of slacking when it comes to the volume of customers they bring into Bed Stuy, it's pretty clear that there's been a (marginal) decline in quality as the (co)owners have focused more on other restaurants that the B+C Restaurant group has since launched. I don't know what's changed in the cooking, but lately all the heat (from Cayenne Pepper) is coated on the skin, and once you've eaten the skin, the chicken inside, while moist, shows no hint of fire. I know this wasn't the case earlier. Hothouse serves a full menu (though I wish they had biscuits), at brunch and dinner, but it would be pointless if you were to come here and not eat the fried chicken. In one of my recent visits, I sat next to a father as he tried to cajole his daughter into trying some fried chicken - but, she resisted all his entreaties. Kids, these days... I have tried the desserts, and don't believe they serve much purpose other than re-acquainting you with your lips and liberating them from their numb state.  I can't say much for the ambience. Peaches Hothouse is certainly not a date place for the crowd that is no longer shopping at Forever 21. The best case scenario is that you'll stop talking after a few bites of that extra hot chicken. In the worse case: you might end up crying in front of your date... not to mention it wouldn't be advisable to take her home and have her listen to a medley of the Berlin Philharmonic and an A cappella soloist the next morning. While Peaches is not in the same league as Prince's Hot Chicken, or Hattie B's... it will save you the trip to Nashville, and is your best bet till another hot chicken place opens up in the city (3.5 stars)
Catching up on reviews here... It was a hot day in August, so probably not the best day to decide to lightly jog to this place after work- thinking I would be late- but the food was decent. We ordered a spring roll to start, which was OK and I had pad thai for my entree, which was better but the customer service was a bit questionable- mostly because I wouldn't be seated and had to stand at the entrance while my friend arrived... what's the point of that? Once she arrived, it took a while for us to be seated and although she was about 15 minutes late there seemed to be open tables, so it was a bit annoying. I was also semi distracted by another guest who was yelling at the hostess for not seating her while she waited for her friend- I agree that rule doesn't exactly make sense but there was no need for her to be in their face like that either. Don't think I will be going back.
I had been Wok Wok-ing all over NYC and my dogs were barking!  From block to block to subway to subway, I was out and about in need of some substinence. This place has all the southeast asian entrees you can think of.  There are a million items one can select from and TBH there may be something there for you.  But for me, it just didn't do it and the dish I had ordered (chicken in black bean sauce) left a lot to be desired.  The thai stir fry with pork was just average, the egg rolls a bit better, but the drunken noodles may have been the best dish of the evening.  With all that being said, there are so many items on the menu that it is probably worth trying again.  Just my $0.02 cents and some food for thought...  =T
"SoCo: A Tragedy ACT 1: The Wait We waited 2.5 hours for a ""45 minute tops"" wait. There was not an offer to speed up the wait process such as offering us to sit at the bar. The host. Hm. The host mislead us and should have been honest - she most likely let people go ahead of us. And when she finally called us for our table, says ""let me go make sure it's actually ready"" I admit, we should have left. But we heard such great things about Soco we thought it would be worth the wait. Sadly it wasn't.  ACT II: Seated Finally we get seated, then our waiter comes once and takes our order. It takes another 45 minutes for all of our food to come out while other people around us were seated later and got their food before us. After the food was delivered we were left with waffles, pancakes and fries without the necessary condiments. I walk inside to find someone I can ask for the condiments. 15 minutes after that is handled our server comes with the syrup and ketchup. Too late.  ACT III: The Bill  Our server messed up our bill with the complimentary corn bread - rookie mistake but forgivable. But she took so long to return that I went to the manager to fix the issue. Fortunately for her, she came back before the manager could come remedy the bill. *18% automatic gratuity for parties of 3-4 for awful service. So prepare thyself.  Finale: No.  We were less than impressed with the service. The food was good, save for the Chicken and Waffles and the Soul-Fried Chicken Sandwich. The waffles tasted like red-dyed waffles, not red velvet and the maple syrup overpowered the taste of the waffle. The experience would've been so much better had someone apologized for the long wait or even tried to remedy the wait process but that didn't happen. The food was great but the service really took away from the whole experience. My advice is to hire servers and hosts worth better customer service skills because today, they weren't there."
Their draft list is quite extensive although not very rare.  Their food is okay but super expensive. The place itself is quite nice and trendy looking. Good amount of space. Came on a Saturday night not much of a crowd so would be a good place to go to actually have a conversation.
It's like a forest in the indoors. I almost wanted to touch the walls and ceilings to see if all the trees leaves and such were real and fake. The front entrance gives a misleading ambiance to the entire restaurant in that it's solely only industrial chic meets cramped spaces . But go to the back and o-la-la- it's cramped industrial chic meets romantic space. The chandeliers and lamps and random books around make it quite boho-chic as well.  Ok so about the food- not too large of portions but just big enough that you don't feel like you'll pig out. My pad kee mao had very fresh basil and was hearty and not too spicy. The pad see eaw was gentler on the palate and not greasy. Nice place, def has a wait, even on the weekdays. While it is very causal, my friend and I were quite underdressed as we came in from an aborted run due to our hangry status haha. So note- probably don't come in athletesiure and you'll have a grand ole time.
So ... cane here on a thursday late afternoon based on yelp reviews ... this place needs to be rated 5 stars if you are looking for a great happy hour during the mid day in NYC.  My wife and I are from Jersey and came into NYC for an afternoon without the kids and we are grateful we stopped here ... The happy hour special is WINE FLIGHTS !!! Holy Crap .... $12 for 3 wines ... they have groups of suggestions but you can also choose any 3 from anything on their wine selection.  My wife did a prosecco/champagne flight while i did some reds:  i loved the selection of pinot noirs and lighter reds.  I am counting down the days when we come bavk and make this our first stop !!!!
Order of one pizza is good enough for 5+ people.  Really great place!
Havana Cafe has been my go to spot for years.  Recently I got a dinner for 2 Groupon as a gift that works Monday - Wednesday.  In the fine print it says you need to make a reservation 24 hours in advance... I get it, i get it.  Havana Cafe is typically busy so a reservation is usually needed. What bothers me is that I got a random craving for Havana, drove there, and tried using the Groupon today (a Tuesday) at 2:30PM.  The restaurant was dead.  And they turned us away, 'as per their guidelines..'.  I even asked to speak with a manager to reason with him and see if they could make an exception and nothing..  bad business practice..  The place was once something really special but over the last few years has seemed to blend into any other mediocre Bronx establishment.  Very sad.
Good pizza! Good wine, delicious olive oil, and lovely atmosphere.  One pizza Margarita, & two wines + tip = 50.00, expensive!
My wife and I ate here two times this week. Once for lunch and once dinner.We ordered Burgers (Medium Rare) twice. That was four burgers this week and all four burgers were well done...The next time we are in the area we were recommended to try Playwright Tavern on the same street. We could have gone to Shake Shack for well done burgers and paid a lot less. Nice looking bar but the food did not compare.
We stopped in to have a cheesecake snack. The piece was big and we were able to share it. I personally thought it was dry, but the girlfriend liked it. But she likes me and I have dry elbows. I think she just likes dry stuff.
A cute hole in the whole with amazing hand pulled noodles. We ordered pickled cucumbers for appetizers which were very refreshing. Then we got one noodle beef soup and a roast pork pan fried dish. For this price, it can't be beat. Seating is tight but the food comes out very quickly. This is why Chinatown is amazing.
I thought the meatballs were ok, nothing special. Pricey for what you get. I had the classic witj spagetti which was medicore. The mini buffalo meatballs were a little soggy to be honest. I wish they did something special or creative like a different type of filling in the middle with cheese or another type of meat. Ice cream sandwiches were awesome though!
Meh. Overrated. $38 for 3 crab legs served in a plastic bag drowning in garlic butter. Too much garlic, and I doubt it was real butter. They count shellfish crackers and write the number down on the table. Really guys? Charge me $38 for crab legs and then have to count the number of utensils? Our bill totaled $280. But you need to count utensils you bought at the Dollar Store? You insult me by assuming I'm going to steal utensils?  Anything other than boil is not good except for crab cake. But that said, I'm not sure one crab cake is worth $15. The fried calamari are nothing but tentacles. Don't bother with appetizers, and stick to shrimp or crawfish boil. Don't mix, I feel we got cheated when we ask for a combo boil.  After all was said and done, this place did not give me a good value or a good time. Dimly lit in the dining room, divey atmosphere but no bargain, and they just give me a creepy feeling like they are watching to see if you steal something.
Unfortunately, Two Hands did not live up to the hype for us. Yes, a precious IG spot. But terrible service and so-so food. Our water was never refilled, an order was forgotten, and we were treated like an inconvenience. The food was good but nothing I would tell someone about. If you want a good IG pic, this is your place. If you want a good brunch and good service, go elsewhere.
What's the hype about?? Arrived at 530 when they opened at 5 and it was already a 20-30 min wait..  Food was mediocre. I've def had better Japanese food. The price was decent at least. Service subpar.  If there's a wait, don't wait.
While I would love to give this place a higher rating and better review since the ambiance and food/drinks were great, the service was WAY BELOW PAR for a nice restaurant. Our waiter seemed completely overwhelmed by the amount of tables he was serving, which resulted in bad service that frustrated not only my table, but the tables around us. Eventually, our frustration turned into a joke as the lady next to us commented that it was as if we were all at an auction for the amount of times we had to raise our hand to try and flag down our waiter. Both times we ordered our drinks, the waiter had to come back and double-check what we ordered (amateur hour). But, the real icing on the cake was when he mixed up the orders on our table and the table next to ours and when confronted did not even apologize. Anyways... to the food and drinks. We ordered: 1.) Seasonal cocktails were interesting and well-balanced, but unfortunately do not recall the names of the drinks we ordered. 2.) Squid ink spaghetti - the shrimp and pasta were cooked to perfection and the chorizo oil added a nice kick. 3.) Grilled pork chop - slightly fatty, but absolutely delicious! 4.) Scottish salmon - decent. Overall, the food and drinks were pleasing to the palate, but the service was a huge letdown and unfortunately the most memorable part of the dining experience. Hopefully, it was a fluke experience and I can update this review if I return.
I really do not enjoy writing bad reviews, but unfortunately this place really deserves it. First the positive. This place is gorgeous, located right next to the Queensborough bridge. The views are incredible! I was able to find street parking without much of a problem and the service was fine. I ordered a mahalo--a rum drink with coconut milk, pineapple juice, and vanilla chai, that was tasty. However, as a place that advertises their chef by name, I was incredibly disappointed with the food.We ordered the rock shrimp tempura, the skirt steak sliders, and the chicken togorashi. At best, the rock shrimp tempura was unexceptional--a little greasy, and I feel fairly certain that the dipping sauce for the shrimp was simply sriracha.  At a restaurant, food has to be pretty terrible for me to even think about sending food back. Prior to this meal, I think in the past year I've only sent back one dish, because it was super burnt. I sent back both the skirt steak sliders and chicken togorashi. The chicken togorashi was so tough we had to request steak knives to cut it and it was still a struggle to cut, let alone chew. Now, when I ordered skirt steak sliders, I expected a piece of skirt steak. What I received was a patty of ground up meat. I asked the waitress if this is how they normally serve the sliders and she said yes, that's what a slider is. (Thinking more about that though, if I were to order fried chicken sliders, I would not expect a fried chicken patty.) She showed both the chicken and the sliders to the manager who was very kind and removed both dishes from our check.  One mediocre shrimp appetizer, an alcoholic drink, and a hot tea came to $37 before tax and tip. We left this meal truly dissatisfied and wound up going to get a real meal around the corner. The place itself is very beautiful, though I did notice a roof leak in the middle of the dining area. I am sure it'd be lovely for a drink in a trendy locale, but if you are hungry, definitely skip this spot.
Pretty rude staff, got hustled in and out before I could relax. That being said, the Ramyun seems to be inconsistent here. I had their signature chili and thought it was OK, pales in comparison to my experience at Jeju on the same day. Everyone else seemed to not be enjoying their meals either. Not sure how this ended up on an Eater list? Definitely better Ramyun out there.
"After walking in the rain for way too long  to get here (cabs were busy) I finally reached soaked and feet hurting. As soon I went in they said my party isn't here yet so I can't be seated. Ok that's an annoying rule but that's fine. I'm sure they noticed I was soaked and my feet were killing me so I said I'm just going to sit at the bar for a few minutes. ""Um you can only sit there if there is no else sitting there."" The place was empty!!  I was livid but didn't have thee energy to look for another place to eat. My party finally came and we all enjoyed the pork ramen and gyoza. My sister loved the pork bun.. I don't usually love them and didn't love them here either.  The service was upsetting. It's common sense and humanity people! I would never say no to let someone sit down if they looked as unkept as I'm sure I did. Food was good but I'm not going back."
I came here for brunch on a Monday and only had to wait ten minutes or so to be seated. The space is pretty intimate and I will admit, I did get some body parts to my back ever so often but what can you do? I got the breakfast bowl(?) and my boyfriend got Jack's Breakfast. We also got two cantaloupe mimosas and a side of the duck bacon (I regretted not getting a side of fries as well so don't have the same regrets as me if you end up visiting!) The ingredients were fresh but the hot sauce really made the dish for me. The bowl was pretty filling. It's a good amount of food and the bowl was seasoned and flavorful as well even without the hot sauce. The duck bacon was pretty good - first time having it. We both enjoyed our food and want to come back to try out some of the other dishes.  I was expecting a super long wait so I was surprised and grateful to be seated rather quickly. To be honest, I expected this place to be over-hyped but it lived up and I enjoyed it. I don't know if I'll be making the trip from DC solely just for Jack's Wife Freda but it's definitely a solid option to check out!
Tanner Smith's is the spot to be at on a Friday night! Luckily our party of five was seated right away downstairs around 7pm.  We ordered a few appetizers for the table: garlic fries, chicken pesto flat bread, beef skillet nachos, and duck confit spring rolls. FYI you can ask for more chips with your nachos for free! Along with appetizers, five shots and five drinks totaling about $170 before tip. Great bar in Manhattan that I would definitely recommend.  On top of that, I had accidentally left my phone behind after we paid and didn't realize until about an hour later. I came back as quick as I could and told the security at the front. One of the managers overheard and said he had a lost phone in his office. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!! So incredibly appreciative.
"They ""mislabeled"" the Serrano ham. They asked if I wanted bread (they didn't  specify it's delivery date). They asked if I wanted dipping oil. Oh, yes, utensils. So much for wasted time in Park Slope's anti wine bar."
I came here thinking it was gonna be amazing considering the glowing reviews and cheap prices, I was sadly mistaken.   I came with my friend, we ordered two beef and noodle soups, an order of fried dumplings and scallion pancakes. The soups were so greasy, it felt like they literally poured cups of cheap vegetable oil in the mix, and to make things worse the soup was so dang salty I felt my blood pressure rise, the noodles were good but thats about it. Next, the fried dumplings were, ok, very mediocre and dry and last but not least the scallion pancake was greasy and stale, not very appetizing I ate one piece and threw the rest out. I left feeling bloated and full of grease, not the healthy meal I was hoping for.  To sum it up for you, if you are on a tight budget and don't care for quality this place will do.
Not authentic Spanish food. The fideuá which a rich complex dish was watery and flavorless. Torta de patata didn't have flavor. The calamari was okay and the sauce was good. The croquetas were okay. The most descent thing was the sangria.  I like the romantic and intimate feel of the place but the food was not up to expectations. I was really looking forward and now I'm a little disappointed.
Me and my brother love noodles. So Ramen is ofcourse on top of the list. And nothing's better than trying a new restaurant that has branches across the World. So what if they do not take reservations. First of all, the place is a little hard to find. If you are not looking at Google Maps and following the blue dot, you would definitely miss the place. Visited for dinner on a Saturday. They had 45 min wait for seating 2 people. And when they say 45 mins it really means that long, unlike some other places. You can give your name and phone number and will get a text once your table is available. We noticed lot of people going for a walk instead of waiting there. There is a tiny bar area that can grab a drink from if you decide to wait. Ok! now when you are heading to your table, the lady will announce your arrival in Japanese (I guess) and all the Ippudo chefs and staff welcomes you. Pretty cool huh! Seating here is limited. You are either facing a mirror or the chefs (like a bar setup) or sharing tables with other groups. So probably would not recommend this one for a romantic meal/date night. We thankfully were sitting watching the chef prepare pork buns. It was funny how one person was putting very little of the sauces while the next one that came put almost twice the quantity in those buns. Wonder who messed up! Ok! so we are vegetarian and simply ordered 2 of the ramen they had on menu. We did not pick the Wasabi shoyu.(They have 2-3 vegetarian options). Order took at least 25 minutes to arrive.So by now, we had waited 75 minutes for our food. IF at this time you feed me grass, I am going to eat that as well, that too happily. Jokes apart, the ramen was fantastic. I have tried many places for ramen. But this one was class apart. Both of them were fantastic. We ordered extra topping of hot chili paste, which was really HOT. The noodles in ramen was fantastic. Thin and well done to soak in the broth. They have the concept of additional serving of noodles if you still have lot of broth in the bowl. That came quickly as well. Overall, definitely a must try if you love ramen. For me, this is the most flavorful ramen I have eaten so far. The service is pretty efficient. Pricing is on the higher side. Ramen comes with basic toppings and you have to pay $2 for every additional topping. I wish though they took your order before seating you so that it arrives sooner on the table.
First time trying this place, they messed up my order to go. When I was far from the place and opened up my bag I discovered that the chicken bowl had absolutely no chicken, just rice and veggies! That's a shame, otherwise the food tasted good. Check your ordered before you leave this place!
"This is probably one of the great hidden gems of Queens. The food is wonderful, the drinks are great and the owner is a stand up guy. The truffle laced fries are like delicious strands of drug laden goodness, the hot dog is an eclectic burst of flavors for you palette; pretty much sex for your mouth. I just admit that my initial reaction to this place was ""what a weird menu"" but it WORKS! The owner was very accommodating, I had inquired if they had spiked cider which he didn't but went out of his way to make it for me. Now that's service!"
A couple of friends and I wanted to come here on a Thursday afterwork. I called and they said they had no reservations available but tables around the bar didn't require that. Ok. We arrived around 6 pm. We were able to get a table for 3. The venue has a great ambiance. The original arches from the warehouses with chandeliers. I would say It's a great date spot. We arrived on time for happy hour. There's only three drinks for happy Hour and three price range appetizers $4,7,9!) we ordered the pizza, meatballs and calamari. The food here is not traditional Italian. The calamari had a kick (spicy) which we liked. The meatballs were small and had like a lemon zest after taste? My friend liked them I've had better meatballs. The pizza was ok for what it was. For dinner I got the rigatoni bolognese and my friend ordered the agnolotti with truffle. The serving size are not large. They are the serving size we are suppose to eat lol so if u have a big appetite, make sure u get apps Along with your entrees. Both dishes were good but the agnolotti with truffle was amazingly tasty and I would order that next time.  The specialty drink at happy hour that I got Was the mixed berry americano. It wasn't really for me. It was refreshing but had like a spicy mustard after taste. After that I just stuck to Sauvignon blanc lol  While we were dressed for the place there were some ppl seated near us very casually dressed. Bc it's a touristy area it will be mixed. But the view of the manhattan bridge and decor as a New Yorker, I couldn't imagine rolling up in there with shorts and tee. Just saying.
The first time I came here really blew me away! My friend and I weren't sure what to order, so the chef made a recommendation based on our taste preferences and whatever he whipped up, it was amazing!! I had such a good impression and was excited to go back. When I finally did, I tried the Sichuan Chili Salmon and it was...okay. I actually felt  bad for dragging another friend with me to eat there after saying how amazing it was my first time there.
Do yourself a favor and don't come here unless you'd like supremely mediocre service. Good to decent food, depending on time and day of service. Generally you are made to feel as if staff is doing you a favor and working against you otherwise. One server said they have nothing but milk when ordering coffee - when it's clear the kitchen is serving cream with other desserts. Multiple requests or questions met with either resistance or hesitation (I.e. Can you make xyz dish vegetarian) Multiple items plated to wrong place. In general, a very mediocre experience for a place that has aspirations to be Michelin starred.
"Happy that we tried this place out. We came here for the Downtown NY special thing - 20% off on Tuesdays. We ordered the trofie with lamb ragu and the linguine with prawns.  My trofie was delicious!  There was a lot of food and very good.  My coworker said the linguine was so delicious and she polished it off in record time. We then ordered the torte and the ""beignets"" that the waiter recommend.  Those ""beignets"" were creme puffs NOT beignets.  I was quite disappointed by that because I'm not such a huge fan of creme puffs and would have opted for something else.  My coworker said the torte was just okay.  Basically, DONT TRY THE DESSERTS.  Stick with the pastas.   The ambiance was quite funky - it was swanky yet there were comic posters as decorations.  It didn't really match so we were wondering where those posters came from/how it matched with the rest of the theme. Overall, pasta was divine and not at all pricey esp with the 20% off deal.  Skip the desserts."
The bread and skylight were good...  Really disappointed!  Came for brunch with a group of 3.  The space except for the back area is sort of dark and uninventive.  We got 2 orders of the poached eggs-  cold, soupy, flavorless mush (and recommended by our very lazy uninterested waitress) and brisket sammie.  The roll was delish- brisket was tender but again no flavor aside from the spicy infused olive oil and hot sauce I had to drench it in.  Roasted potatoes are to be missed as well. I did appreciate the pretty glass tap and sparkling water containers left on our table.  Bus staff was on their game!! Better luck next time, dont rush here.
Last week my friend had his birthday dinner here and I was looking forward to having a more extravagant dinner and a good meal. I could not have been more disappointed. I spent a lot of money and the Orchiette I had as an entree made my stomach upset the entire next day. It was super greasy and really did not have any special flavor to it. Since it is a speakeasy we ordered cocktails - the drinks were ridiculously expensive for nothing that special. I had the fraise savage to start which was fine but too sweet for what I was looking for. I also shared the bone marrow slider appetizer which was fine but nothing special. I certainly would not recommend this place - it's nothing special for it's high price.
It was ok- nothing special. Went here for brunch with some friends. The staff was friendly enough. Your whole party must be there to be seated- totally understandable. We waited at the bar and had a drink until everyone arrived. I had a caipirinha made with strawberry. Not bad. Once at the table service was a little slow- it was in the middle of the brunch rush. The atmosphere is cool but super cramped. We were seated next to a large, LOUD party. The couples were not shy about PDA. I have to say, seeing someone put their hand down the back of their partners pants really puts your appetite off. The food was ok- nothing extraordinary. The runners were a little haphazard. I got hit in the head with a plate at one point. Overall, it was ok but I don't think I'll come back.
New York's Chinatowns are changing right before your eyes, but thankfully Cantonese home cooking still exists in Flushing!! The fried pork dumplings are perfection; the pork chop noodle soup is heartwarming comfort food. The scallion pancakes and assorted bao are delicious.  Everything is prepared from scratch, in-house; no surprises - just great food for a great price. I love this place!
"I only write positive reviews on Yelp but i was compelled to write my first negative review and it's for Gristmill based on their service. My husband and I just moved a few blocks from this place and were hoping to make this a routine local eatery but due to the restaurant's amateur and unprofessional service, we won't be coming back again. The hostess didn't honor our reservation and said there'd be a wait. She didn't even ask what name the reservation was under or the party size or the time when I told we had a reservation. She just told us to wait for our table at the bar. It was just three of us, not a large party size. After waiting for 20 minutes and seeing that she sat a walk-in of four people, we made towards the door to leave. The hostess was standing by the door and like an idiot said to us, ""Thanks for dining with us, have a great night"". She didn't realize that we were still waiting to be seated and our reservation time went past 20 minutes. I told her we never got seated even though we had a reservation. It took her a few seconds to recognize us and realize and then she just said ""sorry"".  While we were waiting on the bar, the bartender was absolutely rude and unprofessional. My friend ordered the drink, ""Rhuby's Sober Now"" and the bartender rudely responded, ""we don't have rhubarb"". It's interesting because the sidewalk sign outside the restaurant was advertising rhubarb with a beautiful chalk drawing. My friend then decided to order the ""Blueberry Fizz"" and I ordered the Ginger Soda. The bartender put my drink on a dirty napkin that I used to wipe up wet sticky stuff from the bar where I was sitting that never got cleaned up. The Blueberry Fizz had a weird taste, almost like Kombucha. It caught my friend off guard and so she asked the bartender what was in the drink. He replied, ""Blueberry Fizz"".  Based on our interaction with the amateur hostess and the rude and sloppy bartender, we will not be coming back. It seems these issues are due to bad management and poor training. Hopefully they improve their service, otherwise I don't think Gristmill will be open for too long."
First time at a Momofuku establishment and I wasn't sure if the food would match the hype, but I really enjoyed my meal here. The atmosphere was lively, and the service was excellent. We shared a bunch of dishes among the 5 of us:  - Hokkaido uni over rice: Decent flavors on this one but not my favorite, though I don't have much experience with uni.  - Long Island fluke: Thought the flavors were perfect with this dish and I really enjoyed it. The ice on top felt novel, though I think I would have liked it without the cold element as well. Either way, a refreshing bite.  - Sardines on toast: Enjoyed this as well, especially with the heart of palm on top.  - Lady Edison ham: Really loved this thinly sliced, salty, melt in your mouth ham. The red eye gravy dip adds another element of richness, and I just wish they gave more bread. - Duck liver pate with foie gras: So smooth and rich and delicious. This is a must get if you like pate! - Montauk scallops: This was my first time having scallops prepared this way and I really liked it. I thought the umami puree was good, but a bit overpowering against the scallops. - Grilled asparagus: An okay dish. I personally didn't feel like the asparagus and bonito went that well together. - Chili pork ribs: Yum! These ribs tasted Korean to me - a little spicy, sweet, and salty altogether.  - Banana leaf roasted skate: First time trying skate for me. The texture is definitely different from your usual fish. There was a certain funkiness (not sure from the shrimp paste or the skate itself) that I didn't quite like in this dish. If you get this, be sure to turn it over because there's more meat on the backside! - Pork belly buns: The pork looked super fatty on the plate, but it was so soft and decadent. I was already full at this point during the meal but trying one of these buns was worth it. The main drawback is that the food is expensive, but the quality was excellent and the flavors on point for the most part.
"We spent our last night in New York next to JFK. Since Jamaica is a rough neighborhood, we decided to find a restaurant that delivered to ""Courtyard by Marriott"". This was the highest rated restaurant that delivered food we were in the mood for. I was pretty frustrated when I saw their version of chinese food. We ordered the fried rice with chicken (paid for extra chicken) and sweet and sour chicken. The sweet and sour chicken was swamped in fluid. It almost looked like soup. The fried rice looked like mexican rice from rice-a-roni w/ strips of the fat from chicken. None of it tasted like chinese food, it was a spicy thai variant. In case you're wondering, when I ordered I chose ""NOT SPICY"". I don't know if they forgot, didn't read that part or just don't know how to make it not spicy.  Let's just say this place left a lot to be desired. I don't know what else you would get around this ""beautiful"" neighborhood but I would probably consider just eating M&M's or go without food. It was way too expensive for what it was. I'd consider it again for free, but that might even be too expensive. 2 stars for delivering the food quicker than quoted, trying their best and at least cooking the food all the way through"
One extra star because they tried to work this out. I ordered delivery. The containers were greasy on the outside and inside. When containers are greasy on the inside (not from the food), this is an indication of bad handling or cross-contamination. Some of the food also had the taste of insect spray. Not insects themselves, the spray used to kill them. The yogurt in the mango lassi had the smell of rotten milk. It took a sip and it was inedible. It was replaced by gulab jamun, which had the taste and smell of insect spray. The milk in the kheer was also old. I tasted it and it could not be eaten. Long story long, the restaurant tried to make it right. And you can tell they're nice people. But there are problems with their processes. It was disappointing because the saag paneer uses real spinach. Many (most) Indian restaurants will use canned or frozen.  Best of luck.
I've been here a few times. Brunch and dinner. I am lucky because I live close and am able to go home during the insane 1.5 hour waits this this place averages. Now for the food. It's super heavy, so be ready for this to be your only meal of the day. I would recommend the bloody mary, they are really good and dressed with a nice crisp piece of bacon and a hard boiled egg. During brunch every one in my party went with the biscuit egg cheese combinations. I got the one with bacon YUM, my boyfriend got the one with fried chicken (their fried chicken is to die for) and my mom just went straight biscuit egg and cheese. All really good. They used shredded cheese so every single bite has cheesy goodness in it.  I also went for dinner with some friends. I got the ceasar salad with fried chicken because I wanted to pretend to be a little healthy before drinking all night. My friend got the chicken parmesan mac and cheese. The dish fed him for the ENTIRE WEEKEND. The portion was huge.  Recommended for a fun brunch! Come at an off time, or make a friend on the UWS where you can hang during your wait. Super loud, so just keep that in mind when you're decided who to take!!
This is one of the better brunch spots in the city.  Here's the breakdown by stars: Food: 3.5 Stars Service: 3 Stars Vibes: 4 Stars I know the math doesn't average out to four but I'll round up for P&K, First of all: bottomless mimosas are $15. You cannot find that in any city, let alone New York. If you come here just for that reason, I would not judge you. The lychee is probably my favorite out of the wide selection that they have. But it somehow takes a while for you to get a mimosas. Not exactly sure why. It's this Filipino/Vietnamese fushion.. so be warned -- authenticity is not prime here. But it's good. We got a variety of dishes for our large party of ten. There were so many things it was hard to narrow down what was the absolute standout. Tip: Don't get the steak and eggs. It's kinda basic. Stick with sisig.  Here's the best thing about this place: THE MUSIC. Hip hop everywhere. It's great. Yes, I would like to hear Usher, Nas, DMX, Pac, etc during my brunch. This should be standard. I'd recommend coming here for brunch. It's more of a family style, at least four people in your party kind of spot. If you're looking for quiet and intimate, this might not be the spot for you.
My friend and I were going to see a movie over in Kips Bay and needed a place to grab a bite afterwards.  The menu at Whitman and Bloom seemed intriguing enough, and it was only a few blocks away, so it was the perfect spot.  As we approached the entrance, I saw that it just looked like a nice pub versus a classy restaurant.  This tends to make me nervous because bar food could really go either way in terms of quality and flavor.  We checked in with the hostess, who stepped away from the stand to escort us to the back dining area and show off her tight leather shorts, which was apparently the outfit for the entire female staff... Though I was not really planning on drinking, I was tempted by the Nocturnal cocktail, which included Death's Door Gin, earl grey tea, honey, ginger, lemon juice, and mint all served straight up.  The massive beverage was sweet, but not overpoweringly so.  In fact, the flavors were all rather subtle, but blended well together.  The drink arrived with some delicious bread that was fluffy and airy on the inside, but with a crispy and sticky crust.  The doughy goodness was paired with a white bean puree that was infused with garlic and drizzled with olive oil.  It was pure heaven. We decided to share the Pot O' Mussels to start.  The shellfish itself was rather mushy and either overcooked or not particularly fresh.  The mussels were lying in a broth of creamy white beans and spicy chorizo.  I believe there might have been some white wine in the sauce as well.  I simply could not get enough of this perfect broth, and even went as far as indulging in several forkfuls of the sausage, which I typically do not enjoy. My entrée consisted of the Chopped Tuscan Kale Salad topped with Grilled Chicken.  First off, the salad contained about 2 pieces of kale, while the bulk of the dish was built upon standard mixed greens.  The toppings were very Mediterranean - peppers, olives, tomato, fennel, red onion, wild mushrooms, feta, and toasted pine nuts, but it was less exciting than it sounded.  The pomegranate vinaigrette was a delightful hint of sweetness though.  In addition, the chicken breast was well-seasoned, but dry. I hate to say that the main reason to return to Whitman & Bloom would be the bread, but I really think that a meal of that, plus a delicious cocktail, would make for an excellent experience.  The rest of the cuisine and service were sadly forgettable.
My review is only for the N2 spicy and numbing beef noodles. I thought I could handle the numbing spice but it was a bit too much for me. It was to the point where I had to take breaks in between bites to let the spice party going on in my mouth die down a bit, so I could actually taste the food. Other than that, the beef portions were pretty good. This location is probably one of the few Xi'an Foods stores that actually has decent seating. Another positive is how quickly our order was ready. I'll definitely come back in the future to try other menu items and order a drink to go along with my food to help contain the spice.
Authentic food but.... And we waited hour for our order and they recognized they forget to put in order. Waiter were keep saying the order in coming and end up come out with the un-cook meat. It's extremely dangerous. I can't go back again. Extremely disappointed
I am shocked that this place has 4 stars. Here's a quick list Why this is not worth your money: - quality is low - portions small - taste is gross - freshness non-existent  - ultimately overpriced  I'm from northern Brooklyn, bushwick area. Here are a few spots that I've compared this place to: - Mesa Coyoacan on Graham Ave - The Tortilla Factory in Bushwick These places are either same price or cheaper, the quality and taste is far superior. If you want authentic try these spots and you'll see what I mean.  Never going back here.
Disappointing.  We loved the music and the ambiance.  But, it ended there.  We had reservations over a month in advance.  After numerous excuses and opportunities to recover, the Flatiron room did nothing but disappoint.  If you are not one of their buddies, don't bother.
I was in NYC for business and met up with a friend in the Brooklyn Bridge area.  He made reservations here.  We were (very) late and they had a table for us upstairs.  Firstly, I love the decor, it's kind of wood and pipe industrial and still really warm.  We started off with appetizers, mussels ( I passed) and roasted carrots that were exceptional.  Then I had the Branzino and my friend had the Cod.  Both were wonderful, flavorful, and light.   Overall, the service was great.  We had Gina as our server, she was patient with us (we talked a lot before we finally ordered) and once we ordered the appetizers came out quickly and served hot, as did the main dishes.  Delightful restaurant, great atmosphere, wonderful location!!!
the calamari is pretty much straight off the generic grocery store freezer rack. though their take on marinara was interesting, it was almost like an Indian curry.  the burgers we had, lamb & bijan, were fine. nothing to write home about.  the service was very peculiar. it was somewhat busy [12-15 people] for a friday afternoon, and one man was tasked with being bartender, waiter, busy boy and host. so i would be in a mood as well. but then that falls on the ownership to employ more people. wouldn't come back.
A bad attempt to open a Mexican restaurant. It seems like Dominican trying to be Mexican. The micheladas  were like nothing I've had before (terrible) and the food was drowned in some weird, salty sauce. This puts Mexican food to shame.
Well I was lucky enough to be dining here during their Anniversary Week so they were serving a four course prix fix menu including a wine pairing for only $49. Part of me was worried they'd cut back on portion sizes or quality or options but it was absolutely phenomenal. To start we had the Raw Yellowtail and Creamy polenta. Both were amazing but I much preferred the polenta. It was divine.  The pasta course was the spaghetti and duck and foie gras ravioli. Good god who knew just plain spaghetti could be so rich and luscious and then don't even get me started on the ravioli. Yes it was a bit salty but that is expected and damn it was good! For the main course we both had the black cod. Definitely the least impressive dish of the night but still good.  For dessert we had the chocolate cake with salted caramel gelato and the panna cotta. Chocolate cake wins by a landslide. The panna cotta was bland and nothing special. The chocolate cake was epic! almost a molten like cake but not and the gelato was a great companion.  Oh and of course don't forget the amazing bread course they serve with focaccia and stromboli served with a plate of mascarpone cheese, olive oil, and tomato sauce.
We had dinner on September 2 at 6.30pm. The bill came out to $299.  We asked for it to be spilt on two cards - $137 on my card and the rest on the other. However, it shows up on our bank statement as $299 on my card and $162.41 on my friend's.  I signed the receipt for $137 + 15% tip. Not $299!!! Emailed the restaurant afterwards, I still haven't heard back! And its September 11 (1pm est) now.
This is one of my go to spots for fried chicken. The chicken is tasty and moist. The waffles are on the dense side but I feel that most waffles in NYC are on the dense side. Staff is friendly and accommodating despite them always being packed!
"This is the first one star review I've ever given.  I'm usually a 3-5 star rater on Yelp and rarely have a horrible experience. Here's what's interesting.  The food was good and we didn't wait long.  The ambience is nice and location is really good.   The bad part:  The owner is a complete jerk who goes out of his way to be rude to paying customers.  I've never experienced such an unearned insulting by a supposed restaurant owner.  I took some solace in the fact that he was insulting a number of paying customers on the way out simply because he was having ""a bad night.""  Our waiter apologized for the owner's behavior on the way out.  I can only imagine what it must be like to actually work for that ingrate. Four star food isn't worth an unnecessary attitude and insults by an arrogant, obtuse operator.   There are plenty of amazing restaurants in Cobble Hill / Carroll Gardens.  This is one you should avoid."
Peter Lugar at one time was just a fantastic place , no more. The quality of the food is not the same at all.  Everything was just ok barely.   The waiters are great everything else wasn't.  For $225 for 2 you'd be better off staying home..
Snooty waitresses and the lounge / table service was inconsistent. My friend says it's gotten more exclusive recently as popularity increased.  Lychee martinis are pretty on point though. Good happy hour deal!
"I am visitor of Los Angeles and just left this restaurant, but I could not wait to write a review for Pig & Khao. I am Filipina and I was excited to see Filipino dishes on the menu.  My husband and I came in on a Sunday around 5:30, so glad we came early because a sudden flood of people came and was filling up like an ice tray! We sat at the bar for a bit more ""cooking action"".  Service was great. Everyone was very attentive and water was refilled at the proper moments. We also received Thai style chicken wings as an OFF menu item compliments of the chef.  We ordered the Pork Belly Adobo, Khao Soi, papaya salad, and Duck. Every dish was amazing and had flavors that I am completely unfamiliar with. It didn't taste like anything I've ever had and that's what puts this restaurant at a completely different level. We saved room for Dessert and chose donuts with kalamansi custard. I was lost for words, I couldn't believe how simple and lovely that all came together. Already, I have this sadness inside me-- the feeling of missing something so far away.  Can't wait to come back!"
I have extremely high standards for Italian food because I think my boyfriend makes the best pizza and pasta I've ever had. BUT this place had pretty decent homemade pasta. They give you bread beforehand with butter that's too cold to spread. I ordered a house rosé which was dark and too fruity for my preference, but hey if you're into that. The caprese appetizer had one of the best fresh mozzarellas I've ever had. The huge drawback of this place for me was the service. Our waitress was incredibly snarky, condescending, and flat out rude. Giiiiirl get out of customer service if you can't even be fake nice to people. Also FYI they do a 20% gratuity for parties of six or more.
Glad I tried this place and glad I came early (11:30 on a Thurs) - there was a long line when I left at noon. I had the signature spicy cumin lamb noodles and they were greasy but flavorful. I also enjoyed the jasmine iced tea. However, the lamb was a bit tough, and toward the end of my meal I spotted a roach on the wall. Womp womp.
So I really want to love this place. It's in my backyard, I like what they're doing.  Hopefully my disappointments are because it's been open less than a week, and still has some kinks to iron out. But, when you're calling yourself the 'church of pork,' like you're the BBQ savior that the masses, the heathens we are, have long so desperately needed ... your kinks should probably be worked out pre-self-proclamation.  The service was above average (the food came out super quick, staff was super attentive); the aesthetic is beautiful.  But the food. Which was the real draw for me. It wasn't BAD, but it wasn't good. It wasn't memorable. It was, however, overpriced. $21 for a too-small serving of underseasoned pork belly and a novel but gimmicky waffle-as-mac'n'cheese left me feeling hungry for more, more Mighty Quinn's or Brisket Town or some other BBQ place without as big of an ego and with a bigger taste/value quotient. Even Dallas BBQ. (That's a stretch, but you get my point.) I found myself doctoring up both the meat and the mac, with salt, pepper, and multiple sauces, and still, somehow, something was lacking. Like I said, it's still early, so hopefully these guys will learn what works and what doesn't, and improve accordingly. Bursting onto the scene as a godsend sets some very high expectations, and, if we're being honest, it is living up to its name: arrogant - having an exaggerated sense of one's own importance and abilities.
The interior is excellent. Hipster, industrial look. We were seated right away. Hostess was friendly.  We ordered the NY fries, which is basically poutine. It was delicious. Serving size was excellent, plenty to share.  We also got the goat cheese salad. It was ok but not extraordinary. The goat cheese was wrapped in a phyllo pastry. It looked great but it's difficult to cut into and the goat cheese ends up spurting every where. The service is not great. Not attentive and super slow. We ordered appetizers and drinks and the waiter forgot about us. Took forever to get our lunch order in. And they got it wrong and took even longer. It wasn't super busy. Took about 2.5 hours from start to finish on a Sunday around 1pm.  It's a cute place for drinks. But I wouldn't go back for the food.
"I visited Sweet Chick - LES last night for dinner with a group of 7 and had a great time! I've been before and remain impressed with this great southern restaurant. I ordered the Queen Of New York drink, made with cognac, fresh strawberries, lemon and sparkling rose. Considering that Sweet Chick is in the LES, $12 are a ""reasonable"" price for the neighborhood.  For my main course I got the special chicken and waffles of the night, spicy peach chicken with pecan waffles, YUM! To add a little more color the waffles are perfectly fluffy and not too crispy, accompanied by three homemade butter options and syrup. While obviously fried, the chicken isn't overwhelmingly greasy, which I much prefer. I don't think you can go wrong with any of their chicken and waffle options. Most of the table got a chicken and waffles dish, while others tried the shrimp & grits (also pictured here) or a variety of the appetizers. We had an Opentable reservation and arrived a little late and with an extra person to add to the reservation (oops..), yet our waiter was completely accommodating. I find the service to be consistent, accurate and the waiters are typically very friendly.  Sweet Chick's other location on Bedford Ave. is also worth checking out, but I find something a little more charming about the Ludlow Street location plus it feels like there is more seating! Tips: Try a cocktail Don't forget to take a look at the specials board They only take reservations via OpenTable, which is extremely convenient!"
"The food was mostly fine, and the service was good. However, I went here for breakfast and discovered that this location is more ""Holiday Inn"" (the hotel to which the restaurant is attached) and less ""Brasserie"" and even less ""Seoul"" (apparently the place is under new ownership as of three weeks ago and the French aspect is being emphasized more than the Korean). So while my breakfast sliders tasted fine (though the portion size of the slide of roasted potatoes was quite small), the menu we were handed was a Holiday Inn menu, not a Brasserie Seoul menu. I felt rather silly going to a hotel restaurant that didn't even bother attempting to distinguish itself (at least for breakfast). It would have been nice to know in advance that the restaurant isn't really a standalone entity from the hotel. I can't speak for what the place is like for lunch or dinner, but I'll probably avoid the place for breakfast in the future."
I was very unimpressed with the food but the service was great. The vegetarian options just weren't that great. I can make better seitan dishes at home and the spring rolls were just okay.
Totally not worth the cost. Got the large Goma Shoyu Tuna which cost around 18 after tax. Did not get enough fish and food in general. Definitely had better quality and more food for cheaper.
Whether you're a tourist visiting with friends or family, or alone and want an amazing dining experience with a great lively vibe, the Smith restaurants always deliver.  This is my favorite of the locations for many reasons. Sharing several dishes is the best way to enjoy the cuisine this place has to offer, and a bottle of Prosecco doesn't hurt to make the occasion extra festive.  Be prepared for the communal restrooms. The first time I saw those I was freaked out at first.  You absolutely need reservations and it's worth the pre planning.  I can't recommend anything specific because I've had about 15 different dishes and they are all amazing.
Got the Vietnamese Uncle Plumps Dumplings (very good!!), crab rangoon (was okay), shrimp springrolls (good), Pad see ew and Pad kee mao both were amazing! Service was fine but great food and inexpensive
This Pizza is literally amazing. I've had the white cheese pizza multiple times and it's to die for. A regular size pizza costs somewhere around $25-30 but it takes 4 people to finish it all so the price turns out to be very affordable. Definitely try it out - it's worth the wait.  It's located in stone street too near a bunch of bars so it makes a great pre-bar dinner spot! :)
The food is exceptional. The strawberry cinnamon ribs are out of this world. Burrata, shrimp, and baked muenster cheese all great. The only reason I give 4 stars is cause our waiter had a serious attitude. Pretension kills vibes man. Trying to eat a great meal, not be judged by our snooty waiter.
This place is awful. For so many reasons. I've been here 3x.  1st time: On a date for post-dinner drinks. It was a week day so the place was quiet. We got some wine and enjoyed the dark, romantic atmosphere.  2nd time: With a party of 4 because we didn't want to wait for Lobster & Burger. Was told by hostess that the wait is 15 minutes. Ended up waiting over an hour. WTF. The food is overpriced, SUPER GREASY, very small-portioned, and really mediocre at best. People honestly come here for the convenient location, ambience and stupid gimmicky stuff like the Ted on a swing and spin the wheel for free fries. The place is loud and seems like a popular place for birthdays.  Apparently it's farm to table, organic, grass-fed, etc. ORLY, 'cause I can't tell what the core ingredients tastes like when it's smothered in sesame oil and sauces.  BJ wings (mixed): Small. Over-seasoned (read: salty as hell).  Fried tiger roll: Greasy. Okay-tasting. Overpriced. LA Galbi: Rice and beef all smothered in sesame oil. It's like just eating fat. Kimchi fried rice: Just whatevers.  Seafood pancake: I...honestly don't remember what it was like exactly; just your generic seafood pancake but costs $5 more than usual. Bulgogi bibimbap: Again, generic Korean fare with an inflated price tag.  3rd time: On a blind date.  Uni Bibimbap: Actually pretty good, I think it's the one dish I actually enjoy here. Truffle mushrooms: I love mushrooms, so it was good, but really greasy. Chef's seasonal salad: yuzu dressing was a nice touch, but just a salad.  Drinks: we just had some beers, decent selection.  I actually didn't want to go back after my second experience, but my date chose the place. After all this...I'd really try not to go back, unless it's to check out the Grain.
Maybe it was just our particular waiter. But he gave me (a white person) an outrageous racist vibe! So we just left. Too bad because it looked like a nice place to eat and drink. this kind of racist scene can be common though in nyc when in south american and in this case cuban restaurants.
The food was okay...nothing to die for. The only problem I had was the service. The waitress was so nasty, and took it upon herself to explain that in New York tip is 20%. I've lived here my whole life I know the drill, but I thought that was so rude. I left a tip just it wasn't 20% it was closer to 15% because the service wasn't that great and in reality tip is not something that you HAVE to leave. It's a choice.
One of the best and most versatile restaurants in NYC. I live nearby and have come here to hang with friends for pizza and beer, for a nice solo meal at the bar, date night, brunch, etc and every time I live thrilled with the food, drinks and service. You're going to get Pizza here, and you should - the Bee Sting, Speckenwolf, Four Emperors, Guanciale and Egg, the original and probably a couple of others, all excellent.  I lean towards the Speckenwolf and 4 emperors. Bee Sting is fantastic but last time I had it, it was more undercooked than usual. Didn't have that problem with the Speck, and the cured meat is torched in the oven with the pie, giving it a more complex texture and flavor. The non-pizza items do not get enough love. The Burger is the best I have had in NYC, maybe best I've had anywhere, no gimmicks just perfectly marbled, dry aged beef seared medium-rare on a housemade potato roll, a classic American Cheeseburger. And unlike more gimmicky burgers at other pizza restaurants, it's well-worth the $16.  Other great options include the duck prosciutto, Bread and Butter (may not be worth the $7 though),  and the radishes. Last visit, I had the roasted corn dish with a corn pudding and blackberries, easily one of the best things I've ever tasted, would've fit on the Wildair menu. Pork Neck is another seasonal option that should be wolfed down this week before it goes off the menu, with some nice roasted potatoes on the side. I was a bit hazy for this dish, since all items pair well with beers or a nice glass of natural, skin-contact orange wine, and the staff is quick with advice and recommendations. I'll be back soon to finally eat the pastas, the only thing I've neglected in my visits.
5 stars for pan fried dumplings -- filling is amazing, right thickness and texture of skin, perfect amount of oil and fry. 3 stars for noodles. They're good but the soup lacks flavors, noodles could be more al dente. I have had better. The new location is much cleaner too!
The ambience here is really nice, they have live music for Saturday brunch, however, the food lacked what the atmosphere had: excitement. I had the avocado smash which looked really sad. It was seriously lacking salt, however the fries and sauce that came with it was really good and I ended up dipping the toast in the sauce, which made up for the lack of salt.
Had to come because of the hype. We waited for.. 15 minutes for a table? Which wasn't bad given it was a Saturday morning, but I think we may have gotten lucky because all the groups in front of us were groups of 3 or more and they had a table for 2 open up very soon after we got there. Would not suggest coming here at a popular time with a group larger than 4, because the number of wannabe diners far outnumber the number of tables and chairs available. We were seated by the door, near the window at the benches. The interior of the restaurant is really cute, with the waiters dressed in various variations of hipster shirts and jeans and black sneakers. We ordered the green eggs (made with tomatillos), duck fat fried house bacon, the rosewater waffle with fresh fruit and whipped cream, and coffee for the table. It definitely made an artful photo - the eggs were kind of just okay. The tomatillo sauce was good, but didn't quite add any flavor to the dish like I thought it would. The bacon was good, but expensive for being a side dish. The rosewater waffle was VERY good.. the rose essence came out like no other, the scent wafting up to us every time we cut the waffle. The fresh fruit was a nice touch too. Overall, good dining experience, although it was very cramped dining quarters - would try other things on the menu maybe, if the wait weren't long again.
I never wrote a review in my life, but I had to do one for Peter Luger...That's how impressive it was, in both good and bad ways Service: The WORST I ever seen. Worse than fast food or local Chinese takeout joints. Our server seems to be having a bad day... had a long face and attitude the whole time while we were there except when he got his 20%. And no, we didn't ask him anything beyond his abilities, ordering our drink and steak... nothing else. I'm not going to state what he did in details since I can write a thick book about how unpleasant experiences it was.  Food: Steak was amazing!!!! But not good enough to change my one star to five stars. Definitely worth try once though. Some might complain about the portion but it was just right for me.
The Smith is always a winner for brunch. Make. A. Reservation! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I got the egg white omelette, which was healthy and filling, yet light. It's nothing outstanding, but it satisfies. If you like goat cheese and spinach, get it. Comes with a small greens salad, too. My friend got the Sicilian baked eggs (very similar to shakshuka if you're unfamiliar with this entree), which I've gotten before and absolutely love. Tried a bite, and made a mental note to get it again next time. Other friend got the classic eggs benedict, the classic bacon and eggs on an English muffin.  I love the ambiance that The Smith embodies: bright, buzzing with conversation, modern, filled with ambitious, yet relaxed, professionals and families. Our waitress, Jenny, was super friendly and helpful. Our coffees were refilled over and over, and when my friend said it wasn't strong enough for him, she gladly swapped it out for an espresso. Great service all around!
First of all, the service is great! I like the staff here. They are welcome and friendly. They will keep you happy. After a long day, it is always good to have a delight conversation.  The roll is good, but it is short, 6 inches at most. And the lobster is is cold, which I think it degraded the flavor. The crab roll is not my type . I ordered a bite size and think I will recommend the lobster instead.  For $17 , I think it is reasonable as it is Manhattan.
Overrrated. Came here for lunch. Terrible soup, poor quality service and the crab cake slider had way too few crab in it. The backyard is nice with a beachy touch to it. That's all. I really don't understand the fuzz and enthusiasm about this place.
My friend chose this place downtown and the $$$ is always a turn off for me, l expect a prissy ass overpriced blah.  Felice was in fact reasonably priced , delicious, and beautiful. The wait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable and the hostesses were very accommodating even though we had no reservation.  We had the meatballs, risotto balls, tagliatelle with ragu, and branzino. + 2 drinks all for $96 . Well worth the money and I would recommend!
Wow so disappointing. I can't believe an institution like dinosaur bbq would drop the ball this hard. First of all the wait on a weekend is almost an hour. Then you have to wait another hour just to get your food. Honestly I wouldn't come here again even if there was no wait and you got the food instantly. The brisket was hard and pretty flavorless. The pulled pork was OK, nothing crazy. The ribs had a weird flavor to them like it was particularly bad meat. The mac and cheese was runny and flavorless and the other sides we tried we nothing special. DON'T COME HERE
Bookmarked this place a while go. When presented with the opportunity to stop by, I had to. Loved it. Employees were very welcoming as soon as my son and I walked in. They even gave him some stickers. Very attentive and the food was delicious! I had the mac and cheese and fried chicken. Finger licking good! Would definitely return.
This tiny little Thai place in Hells Kitchen serves up big flavors and big portions that satisfy your tummy and your wallet. Special mention to the baby back rib appetizer and the crab fried rice. Truly delicious and I will go back to try more dishes for sure. Bring your friends! You won't be disappointed!
Best part about the restaurant was the no-wait on a Friday night. Given its inconvenient location and low volume, it's possible that the restaurant staff was more attentive than usual.  Regarding the food, the boyfriend ordered fish and chips and I ordered a burger.  We also ordered the calamari to start. The fish and chips were okay - not the best, not bad. Fries certainly were not worth the calories.  The burger was blah. I've had better at in and out. The meat didn't taste fresh and the cheese was hard. And the bread didn't look or taste fresh.  Calamari was just okay. Plenty of space and the staff was nice so overall it was fine.
Hands down the best Cuban food I've ever eaten, we got the Cuban sandwich, chorizo and eggs, black beans and rice, and sweet plantains and it was all amazing!!
Be still my heart.  I returned to Kyclades on Tuesday at 7 pm and there was no wait! My BFF was in town with his cousin who was visiting from Athens. It was said cousin's birthday and Kyclades was the *only* place that could measure up.  I tried the stuffed clams with crabmeat appetizer for the first time. Sooo good.  But the most shockingly tasty new items were the fried items that I usually don't order. The fried calamari was LIGHT. The bread was fluffy, light and crisp. Such a different experience from the overly breaded calamari served in all corners of NYC. I usually order my calamari grilled - but Kyclades was a game changer for me.  BFF also insisted on the crispy fried potatoes in lieu of the lemon potatoes and I had the same sentiment as the fried calamari.  And of course, the galactoboureko, for dessert. It's simply perfect for my palate.
It's pretty good with reasonable prices. However, the selection of seafood is a bit limited. But it is worse going at happy hour. I felt the complimentary whiskey cake is better than the seafood they offer
NO! Never again lol. My friends had one drink here, the shark tank one, and it was basically Sharknado...terribly done and you can't reclaim your time after. After two sips we asked for the check, paid, and immediately left. The happy hour deals weren't even good. Very cute lighting and decor but sketchy elevator. Issa no from me on this one.
Friendly staff and yummy appetizers! Love that they have Happy Hour on Saturday! The margarita was delicious!
Had lunch with a friend here. They were out of the vegan chorizo taco (which I desperately wanted to try), so we had the guac, juice, and a few tacos. The three star rating is for the fact that the tacos were fairly bland and rather expensive for what you got. The street corn, however, was yummy, and the service friendly - but I wouldn't come back just for that.
Great evening at, the highly anticipated, Traif. Learned after being seated that on weekends (except for on Sunday), parties of less than three can only do the tasting menu at the bar, so, you guessed it, we were lucky to trade our table for a couple of seats at the bar! The tasting is an awesome experience because, obviously, you get to taste dishes you might not ordinarily go for. That said, it's a double edged sword since some courses may not mesh perfectly with your palate and you can only specifically request two courses, the rest come at the chef's selection, although food allergies and preferences are requested at the beginning of the meal and vegetarian options are available. Food is served family style, so if you're uncomfortable sharing plates, steer clear of the tasting menu altogether.  When I return, which I will, I think I'll order a la carte so that I can be more particular about my preferences.  Don't miss: Tuna tartar  Scallops (we specifically requested) Short rib sliders (we specifically requested) Ribs with pomegranate  Chocolate pudding  Bacon donuts  Next time would love to try- Cauliflower - server mentioned was one of her favorites Broccoli rabe- looked unreal with toastsmotheredincheese and a runnyegg Crab meat with polenta looked and smelled amazing Pate looked great Consider skipping: Sweet breads (I don't have anything to compare them to but they were an unpleasant texture and not pleasant in seasoning for me) We also got to try which were good but not superlative - Shrimp - very good Pork belly - pretty good Salad with Asian pear and roasted peanuts - fine but nothing to write home about Carrot soup shots - good The cocktails missed the mark for me. I tried a couple and the one with the rum floater and rosemary sprig was my favorite. The bar tender was friendly, working hard, and helpful, but somehow these drinks were a bit heavy for me.  All around, this place serves quality food in a fun, unpretentious atmosphere. The tasting menu lets you feel like royalty with 11 courses at a fair price point ($50 pp) that works for a special occasion without completely breaking the bank.  Looking forward to returning and can't wait to check out their brunch!
Great decor. Brussel Sprout Hash was perfect!
Great place! Amazing atmosphere just a tad bit pricey but perfect for a lovely evening in the city
I came on a brunch date and the entire experience consisted of waiting. We got there early and it was just the two of us, but there was already a line. Not being one to shy away from long wait times (long lines = popular place = it must be a really good place = new yorkers don't just wait in lines for nothing), we put our name on the list and stood around. It took forever. It seemed like once people sat down, they didn't want to get up. They just sat and talked and sat and talked even after they were done eating, not minding the huge crowd of people waiting to eat. We almost left, but then a table opened up for the two of us so we decided to take it.  We placed our order, which at this point, I don't even remember what we ordered. It took forever. We waited. The table next to us waited. The table on the other side of us waited. Everyone just waited. One of the tables was offered free mimosas. We were not. We waited nearly an hour for our food until our waitress came to explain to us that they were doing an inspection and couldn't have food leave the kitchen until it was over. That's fine, I get it, but why couldn't that have been explained to us before we sat down or maybe even when our order was being taken. We literally just sat there and got hangry because we thought it was bad service.  So after the inspector left, we then had to wait for them to make the actual food. When it came out, I can't say if it was good because we were starving by that point or because it was actually good. Not sure if I'd go back. Maybe if a friend really wanted to try it, but I'm a little wary after the experience. Cute place though!
Where do i begin...ok so im a vegetarian so that tells you about the entrees i had and how amazingly delicious everything tasted. I indulged in some eggplant Francine with rigatoni pasta. Bread was complimentary, but i ordered the garlic bread with parmesan cheese instead and it was so beyond tasty. I also had the tiramisu which was absolutely delectable. To cap my night i had some Irish coffee with was made to perfection.  Now onto the staff...my new family. They were so friendly hilarious and accommodating. One of the staff members even made sure I got into a taxi Faithfully. I will forever be a regular here and I think you should too!
This wasn't the Chinese food we were expecting. The food quality was low, the wait was long, and the flavor was meh.
Our evening at Eleven Madison was probably the most unsatisfying culinary experience I've ever had. Nothing for nothing when you enter an establishment like this one you should be in awe. They were on the other end of the spectrum.  Their service was ok. I can't really complain but they didn't give us a goody bag to take home. Which was shocking since everyone else did.  The food was far from 5 star. I mean it was just so bland. I didn't understand what I was eating. I can honestly say the only good thing was the foie gras. Everything else was pretty bad. Don't waste you're hard earned money on this.  Cheers
Amazing burger and beautiful setting. One mark off for slow service, but they are new so room for improvement.
Pretty overpriced considering what soba is. The service and ambience was really nice. The food was light and delicious, but definitely not very filling. The skewers were pretty good but nothing special.. We enjoyed our experience but I don't think we'll be back.
Fame aside, Roberta's is a really excellent pizza experience. Dropped in for a weekend lunch and was seated after about 15 minutes of nursing a beer at the bar.  Almost as good as the pizza was the warm bread served with the meat platter.  It took the limits of willpower to not ruin our pizza appetites by eating up all of the rich, crunchy loaf with a soft, aromatic crumb.  Meats themselves were good, but without the duck prosciutto, nothing life changing. Ordered the Bee Sting and Lil' Stinker.  Both were delicious, though the hot oils of the Bee Sting definitely overshadowed its counterpart through the beginning of the meal, only for the Lil' Stinker to reassert itself as both pizzas grew cooler.  In the future, would suggest an order of one standard pizza (to enjoy the cheese, crust) along with one screamer in order to allow a true survey of the Roberta's experience. Crusts are best saved until the end of the meal, then devoured in the spicy olive oil available at each table.
The staff here were unbelievably rude so regardless of if the pizza was any good it put you right off your food anyway! We got rushed in and pushed to the corner of the restaurant and were sat next to another couple we didn't know which isn't a big deal at all and personally I don't mind share table style eating anyway but even overhearing there conversation they felt the same as us regarding the wait staff.  There was no personality and they thee the menus down in front of us with no eye contact and when we were actually ready to order we had to wait for hem to stop mucking around and talking amongst themselves to get there attention, they weren't happy at all about having there little party interrupted! The food came out and was just OK and the wine was average aswell with a huge NY style price tag which was the real kick in the guts after the meal too.  I would be soooo much happier grabbing a slice from Artichoke for 1/20th of the price and leave feeling good about the service given.  Never again B side effort
I got here after 2pm and there were only a few people in line, so I didn't have to wait long. No-nonsense service here, and I guess they are used to long lines so they served up the food really quick and efficiently. Ordered the lamb & chicken over rice. It was a really big serving and I just barely managed to finish half of it, making it a steal at only $7! I really liked the combination of the white sauce and hot sauce with the lamb, rice and cabbage. The chicken was a little dry, unfortunately. I had quite high expectations for this food truck given its popularity, but honestly, if it weren't for the sauces, the food was actually just really normal.  P.S. The white sauce and hot sauce comes separately in packets, so you can adjust the amount of sauce that you want on your food.  P.P.S. Don't be too liberal with the hot sauce unless you like your food really spicy!
Easy going. Calm atmosphere and good drinks Great after a long day at work.  Love the backyard seating
Maybe I just didn't get the right dish but I wasn't particularly impressed with the malaysian seafood curry. The service was excellent though and a friend vouches for it. If I'm back I'll try the sushi and see how it goes.
Come here for old-school unique decor, but don't come here for the dim sum. I was disappointed to find the signature dishes, such as the Turnip Cake, Ha Gao, Pork Bun and others, to be mediocre and not worth the long wait. Ingredients were not fresh and tasteless.  I recommend Sunshine (on Divison), Golden Unicorn, or Jing Fong if you want quality dim sum.  Tips: Takes only AMEX or cash.
"The only reason I am giving 1 star, was the delicious food. The service was horrible.  As soon as my guest and I placed our drink order and did not order alcohol, we were immediately treated like second class citizens and didn't get our ""complimentary"" olives. No one ever asked if we wanted a refill on our drinks. There were so many waiters standing around doing nothing. They were very quick to take away our plates and bread that we were still eating from. The bus boy even dropped my napkin on the floor, took it away, and never replaced it.  Our dessert came way before our coffee. And not once did anyone ask if we needed anything or how our food was."
Yum, really lucky we only had to wait less than 30 minutes for a table for 2 on a saturday in the dead of winter when i hear the wait can be 1 hour to 1.5 hours! they take down your number and text you when the table is ready so that you can explore or chill while you are waiting for your table one of the best southern brunches i've had, worth the trek out to brooklyn, very close to the F train --fried pork chop with cheddar waffle: loved the light cheddar waffle! the fried pork chop was good too but some parts were too thick so it got a bit dry --SHORT RIB HASH: i heard people complain that it's too fatty but that's what makes it so good!! sure it's a bit salty but with that runny egg and buttery toast on the side, this was so good! NOTE: they also have bar seating
Beautiful space that's deceiving from the outside...you've probably walked past this place many times without realizing that it existed. Cons :  - extremely tight seating.  I felt a bit claustrophobic upstairs and we were uncomfortably close to our neighbors.   - only one waitress upstairs the night we went and probably 6-7 tables. Pros: - traditional Thai food with some adventurous options mixed in.  Vegetarians beware, you won't get to pick off the royalty menu because there aren't any options. - beautiful decor; feel like you're transported to Thailand.   My friend and I shared the prawn/mango salad which we asked to be mild but it was still spicy!  Can't image what medium would have tasted like.  There were two prawns on top and tangy mango, peanuts, etc. on the bottom.  Very nice flavors and generous portion size.   I had the red curry with tofu and veggies and it was also flavorful and I thought the portion size was generous.  The curry had tons of tofu, green beans, carrots, and some broccoli.   My friend had the pad Thai which was presented beautifully with fresh noodles and wrapped up like a present.  She seemed to enjoy her dish.   The shot of complimentary coconut soup they give you at the beginning is ahhhhhmazing!  Flavor explosion in your mouth.  Overall, worth a visit at least once if you like Thai food.
Trademark is def a cute restaurant. Especially the cafe section upfront. Unfortunately, it wasn't open when we came at night. A nice gentleman greeted us when we arrived and showed us to our table, a private little booth. It was quiet and away from other guests. The restaurant is beautiful very romantic. Overall a nice feel. This restaurant is attached to a hotel. You do have a lot of stragglers coming in and out which makes it a little weird thru out the night.  The menu has a lot of great items to choose from we decided on  For drinks the names slipped my mind but I remember they weren't as balanced as we thought they would be. They were on the strong side and sourish.  For dinner we ordered Burrata and garlic knots- This was adorable. The burrata was perfect, with the rich and sweet sauce underneath. The creamy burrata completing it and the knots to catch the sauce. I do feel the knots though were a bit stale or sitting out maybe.  We also ordered the kale salad and added salmon. It was a rather large portion. The flavors of the salmon was really good. It was cooked perfectly and the skin was crispy and delicious. But, the kale salad was WAY over seasoned with salt!!  Some def had a heavy hand!! After a couple of bites it was hard to eat.  We also ordered the pork chop and came with some potatoes. I'm really sorry we ordered this. It was SWIMMING IN BUTTER!! The potatoes were raw! Although the pork was cooked perfectly there was really no seasoning!! Smh  We also ordered the crispy chicken sandwich this was amazingly perfect. Crispy, juicy, the bun soft and delicious. This was a great chicken sandwich.  We decided to stay of dessert. I wish we didn't. We ordered the cookie in a pan and what we got was a burnt cookie on the outside and raw mushy on the inside and melted ice cream. The iced coffee was good. The waitstaff is nice and pleasant.  This restaurant needs to be more consistent with their food. You can see there more of a hotel restaurant.  Would I recommend this place?  Prob for the chicken sandwich and the ambience. (259)
Close to Penn Station, had lunch here.  Not bad, but not great.  Good location though.
I was rushed out by the server during the dinner, they came here so many times trying to take my plate away when I was eating. And I am a fast  eater. What more unbelievable is, when I finished sign my bill the server came and said I must pay AT LEAST 15% tips. I paid about 12%, ($85 in total, I paid $10 tips) because my dinner was so rushed, I didn't feel comfortable the whole process. But eventually I paid what they asked for. I thought the amount of tips is depend on the service customers received, and they should earn the tip by their action. May be I was wrong
Went to Soco for brunch with friends yesterday. We were super late for our reservation, but we didn't wait too long for another table. No complaints on the service, even the busboy was friendly, helpful and joked with us. We shared mac and cheese as an appetizer and it was THEE BEST. I had sausage and grits, which came with 2 over easy eggs and lobster sauce. It was good, but probably wouldn't order it again. I also drank a red lemonade ((alcoholic drink), I enjoyed it. Cool spot with outdoor seating it's the back, wasn't too crowded. I would return.
"What a horrid experience I just had here! I came here for a business lunch with someone who does work for my firm. I've never been here, and he frequents the establishment and wanted to make an impression. However, we both left with sour tastes in our mouths. We arrived around 12:50 and were seated in the back. We passed the vault and the bar area, which was very crowded--the back area was relatively empty. The server came over after five minutes or so and asked if we wanted anything to drink; we didn't, the water would do just fine. Her attitude from this this point forward grew exponentially. She returned shortly thereafter, and we still weren't ready. Again, with the attitude. When she came the third time we began to order. I wanted the Salmon, that I saw in Yelp pictures, but she informed me that was no longer on the menu. They now only have raw Salmon--I'll pass. I was convinced to order the Trout as a replacement by the person whom I was meeting with, I agreed. He also wanted to get an appetizer; he went with the steak tartare, but I'm not a fan, and when it arrived I opted not to have. In an effort to appease me; he summoned her over to return the steak tartare, in favor of a cheese plate, and she became noticeably angry. She responded, 'didn't I tell you it was raw steak"" after explaining to her I didn't want raw steak.  By this point I was fed up with her-- because I dropped my knife and when asked for a replacement, she angrily handed it to me. I've never seen such rude treatment. The breaking point was we had been there over 45 minutes, and no entrée. After waiting five minutes for her, we inquired where was the food. She says, ""oh, ill put it in now"" What the hell; we've been sitting here almost an hour and have jobs to return to. He begins to ask her why she didn't do it before, and she said, ""I'll put a rush and it will be out in 5-10 minutes"". He requests to speak with a manager, who is somewhat apologetic; she waives the cost for the appetizer, and we leave. I don't ever see myself returning-- We received very poor treatment and waited over an hour for entrée, that never even arrived!"
This restaurant recently changed their name. It's very close to the Loom Shopping Center and a busy part of Bushwick. It didn't seem like their food had a lot of healthy options, just more like good old fashioned American home-style cooking. Mac n Cheese, fish tacos, hamburgers, sweet potato fries and so on.  We had a party of eight, without any  reservations, they were able to get us in about 45minutes. The staff was sweet and we were all served what we ordered promptly.  Good music on the speakers, full bar... Not sure about their version of the Moscow Mule.. but that's another story..
Make no mistake, Hendrik's is not some trendy farm to mouth place. No amount of candles, kale, or exposed brick can hide the shocking truth that this is just another straight up bog standard diner with a capital D.  We had brunch, and were treated to the exact same bland Sysco eggs, flavor-free coffee, and rock hard foil butter pats that you will find in literally every diner in NYC.  Even the potatoes were the identical recipe shared by every greasy spoon clone from Inwood to Battery Park...a mushy pile of the 3 Ps; potatoes, peppers and paprika.  The chic staff of this nouveau eatery is a diner staff hiding in dark ironed shirts. Despite the outward appearance of Hendrik's as a hipster joint, you'll find no tattooed chef. No man-bunned barkeep. I think I even recognized one or two of the staff from my local diner.   Given that the place was mobbed with 3 Red Wedding sized banquet tables filled with yammering millennials, (thanks for clogging up every kitchen in the city you roving packs of afraid-to-be-alone-for-5-seconds idiots!) it's pretty obvious that the draw of this place is the cheap drinks, and definitely not the food.  On the other hand, people have posted an utterly inexplicable 500 photos of the mediocre food.  The biggest differences between this place and my local diner?  At my local diner, I don't have to ask for a knife, water, salt and pepper, or butter and jam, and the food is served quickly and hot.  I wouldn't have minded any of this if the place was called Hendrik's Diner, or had the universal diner warning sign of a revolving dessert menagerie in the window.  But we peeked through the glass and glanced at the menu and were duped by appearances.  This is a knock off of a decent restaurant.  It's just another diner, and a lame one at that.
Horrible customer service, 3 in the area and impossible to get reservation. They can care less what u tell them. Won't even try, won't hear customer on the phone. Even worse when in person. No class. Watched empty tables for 45min, no one showed up and they won't accommodate us. Would strongly recommend other 3 in the area like SugarCane or Atrium !
"I've been here twice and I enjoyed it both times, but during my most recent visit I had a frustrating experience.  First of all, they don't have working air conditioning.  I ate here for the first time in August and then came back at the end of September, and both times the AC's were not on and the door was open.  It was in the high 80's yesterday so it was *hot* in there.  I'm not sure what that's about, but it made the experience less enjoyable. The main issue: I ordered the Chili Scrambled Eggs and asked if I could substitute mushrooms for the bacon that normally comes with them.  They have mushrooms in one of the other dishes, so I didn't think it would be a big deal.  The waiter said that he wasn't sure if they could do it, and that he would need to check with the chef.  I told him that it would be fine if they even just threw them on the side of the plate or something, but he said the same thing.  I found that odd. Sure enough, my scrambled eggs had no mushrooms, and the person who brought us our food (a different waiter) didn't say anything about it.  Well, I guess that was my answer.  When our waiter came back I asked him about it and he said ""yeah, they weren't able to do that.""  Now I understand having a policy against people asking for special meals or trying to assemble their own dishes in a way that creates extra work, but all I asked for was some mushrooms in my scrambled eggs.  As a vegetarian, that's the kind of thing I ask for all the time, and it's never a problem.  I would never ask for a price reduction, but since I'm being charged for the meat that I'm not getting, it only seems fair for them to substitute something else (which is even cheaper than the meat anyway).  Instead, they denied me of that and charged me the full price.  That's not good service. Then there were just some other small issues.  My girlfriend's avocado toast came with a lemon to squeeze on top and the lemon they gave her was rotten (literally dark brown).  It wasn't like one of those iffy garnish lemons you get at a bar, it was actually rotten.  They also tried to charge us for the wrong cocktail (which was more expensive).  Individually, these things are inconsequential mistakes, but when taken together, they made the whole experience a little bit more bumpy. I give three stars because the food is otherwise really good and everyone is very friendly.  The portions are small and it's expensive, but that's just their model, so you can't fault them for that.  I'm sure this isn't a common experience, so I'd recommend the place (so long as you don't mind waiting in line and being very hot)."
This seemed like a fun place for brunch in Manhattan, with a few unusual virtues and vices. The cocktail list looks measured and playful, and the slightly boozy teapot infusions were interesting, though I didn't really partake. The hostesses were also surprisingly friendly and accommodating in finding seats for us rather than the usual ordeal of the waiting for hours and being scolded for incomplete parties. On the other hand, my lamb burger's bun disintegrated, and forced me to eat with a knife and fork. (A more frequent problem than you'd think, which surprisingly few places have solved.)  And the light fixture above our table had a tiny but persistent drop of water coming out of it which drove us batty (and made us worry a little bit about the safety and integrity of the wiring!). You could do far worse, but I wouldn't rush to spend your valuable hours in NYC here.
So good !!! Full of lobster on a buttery toast!! But obviously so small! Always craving for more after one roll but they are a little pricey :(  But a cute place in the financial district - dressed up like a pier in a small shop in one of the streets Was actually in the way to show my brother the bull so :/ - easy enough for tourists to do as well while going around
nice alternative to the various asian food places in this part of town and a short walk from the courts. so if you want some comfort food in a place that has chill vibes after performing your civic duties you should stop on by. I had a taco trio (fish, steak, and carnitas) and I'd say that I enjoyed the fish tempura taco the most. the steak had some nice flavors as well. the only bummer is that they only take credit cards if your order is $15 or more.
The  food range from good to subpar. The avocado salad and seafood dish were tasty and fresh. The other entrees chicken, rice etc, were so-so to tasteless. The server was NOT attentive. I don't know if it was due to him having so many tables or he just provides awful services to customers. I expected better quality food and service given the reviews and I  was just let down. I would not be returning can find better food establishments for the same price point without the aggravation.
On Friday, my team decided to take a break while working late. Barn Joo is about a 5 minute walk from our office so we decided to head over. The place wasn't too packed and we got a table right away. The waiter was kind and took our order.  Spicy pork Kalbi bun  Chicken bun Wings  Lychee soju The food was great but our buns came out at separate times. The waiter noticed our anxiety in waiting and have us another order of pork buns on the house.  Overall, the meal was great.  While we waited to pay our bill we got hit with a big surprise. There was a water bug climbing up the wall by the bar. The whole staff looked surprised and pointed at it. My entire team noticed and the staff made it real obvious.  I was shocked to see the bug just chillin and climbing up the wall. I definitely felt sick after seeing that.
All-in-all, nice location and decent pizza, though I prefer a more flavorful crust, especially in wood-fired pizza. The real disappointment was the poor service and the charges for refills of fountain beverages that simply appeared on the check.  Seriously? Who does that? $2 for soda water is acceptable, but for a 6 oz. glass?  And to charge again without explaining the policy? And to take forever in bringing a refill? I'm sorry Il Fornetto but I don't think we'll be returning.
After 30 mins of worthless wait at our table  for this amazing meal . The lunch was not even worth the pictures . Ordered chicken kawab lunch special with rice pilaf. The chicken is rubbery , flavourless except it has hint of lemon. The spaghetti with shrimp, both were not cooked properly .So this dip here saved me .I guess they serve good salads ONLY.All I could eat was the dip . That got it one star . Never recommending never wasting my money again
Brunch 45 Bucks all you can Eat and Drink for 2 hours Yes Plz food is amazing Drinks are Delicious!!!
"I ordered ""The Ludacris"" four fried chicken wings. What a waste of money.  I paid $18 for wings with no seasoning.  Even the Mac & Cheese was bland. The collard greens was decent.  This is the worst soul food restaurant I ever ate at.  Definitely overpriced.  What a disappointment Harlem!  I'm sticking to Virgils in Times Square."
We loved our first visit.  Their duck ramen was so delish.  Their clams, chicken drum sticks and the U&I was out  appetizers were so so good. I dont remember which ramen my husband ordered but he loved it. Everything was so delish. We will definitely go back again.
"I came here because my sister's friend with whom we were dining, visited before and really liked it. Of course, I checked out the rating on Yelp first, so that I had an idea of what to expect. We arrived and I made reservations while we waited for the host at the front of the packed bar area (because I like getting my points from OT). The place looked promising because it truly was packed. The host and another gentleman assisted and tried their best to get us a table right away but it was really just a waiting game.  We sat and because we had already stuffed ourselves with raw bar Oysters and prosecco earlier, we ordered only small plates. My sister and I bother ordered the Butternut Squash and Pear Soup which she found Spicy and good. I also ordered the Guacamole because I LOVE guac. It was very good. It came with Unsalted tortilla chips which was perfect because the guac had enough salt for each chip you blessed with the slightest hint of some green schmear. Our friend had the Langosta Tacos and my sis and I both tried them. They were Ok but definitely not worth the hefty price. I also went for the Mac & Cheese which was good.  The drinks were Ok. I asked for a dirty martini. It wasn't that spectacular.  At some point, during our meal, my sister noticed something on the wall behind me and tried to very discreetly motion me to switch seats and sit over by her. I freaked (naturally) and turned, only to see a cockaroach crawling centimeters by my head. I am SO afraid of bugs and tried to not be overly flamboyant in my escape but I think I created a minor scene (people were definitely looking in my direction).  I sat next to my sister, a manager came over and tried to apologize. He explained that they just had a fumigation done (information I could have lived on without knowing). I immediately lost my appetite and stopped eating, as did my sister. The gentleman that came over to our table tried to make things right by giving us a free round of drinks. I am unsure of how my company's drinks came out but my dirty martini tasted as if there was something sweet in the glass before they made my drink so I got turned off, didn't finish my ""free"" drink, we paid and left.  I doubt I would be back. The quality and taste of the food is no justification for the menu prices. I see a lot of high ratings but not even counting the bug issue (I personally have to count it, otherwise), I still want return."
Waited 45 minutes today. We arrived at about 430pm. I had the modern ramen which was good. Broth was really good. Texture of noodles not so much. They are thinner than traditional noodles and a bit more tough. I ordered a second order of noodles to go with leftover broth and they were even more tough and slightly undercooked. The boiled eggs were delicious. Probably my favorite two bites. The signature wings are also delicious. I can't believe it took me 7 years to get here. It's worth a visit but I wouldn't return. The service is quick but feels factory-like getting people in and out. Ps I used to live in Japan for 4 years so I'm a bit of a ramen / Japanese food snob.
I intern nearby and I'm always looking for cheap places to eat. This place pretty unique and has some solid food. I've had the classic burger with fried egg and jalapeños. With my Indian background I'm used to really spicy food. I love that this place has a wide variety of hot sauces!!!! You can pick and choose to find the one that suits your needs.  The tacos are wonderful. The day I had them, I had devoured them in seconds. But the tacos had so much juice and flavor. The little lime wedge made all the difference with a burst of acidity. This is a great place to get quick food.
TL;DR: YOU CAN'T GO WRONG. It's cheap. It's flavorful. It's legit. The first time I ate here, I had a stupid smile the entire time (even while chewing) 'cause my taste buds were singing. SERVICE/SPEED/AMBIENCE: Quick & clean. I usually order takeout 'cause I live around the corner, but the one time I dined in was also a pleasant experience. FOOD: Everything that I've tried here has been on point & legit (minus XLBs aka soup dumplings). Congees - I've tried both the chicken ginger + scallion and the pumpkin + mustard green. Both were delicious, hearty, and flavorful. Braised Beef Brisket Lo Mein - standing ovation. The brisket is so tender, it just melts in your mouth. And the lo mein is cooked perfectly al dente, the bite is SO clean. And the clear broth that comes on the side, oh man.. umami af. Ox tail with curry - bomb, but really heavy on flavor. It was a little too much for me as a stand alone meal, but definitely great as a secondary dish. Also FYI (just in case)- this curry is the XO sauce kind! Beef chow fun - Pretty tough to mess this one up, and they didn't so we good. The beef is also very tender, better than most places. XLB - their soup dumplings are HK style. As a shanghainese person, it didn't suit my palette at all. However, I'm not judging this place based on XLB's, I only wanted to mention this just in case to set expectations. Five stars because the food is one of the best in the area and for the price, service more than meets expectations.
I had high expectations from all the Yelp reviews and pictures! I've heard amazing things about Two Hands--the cafe. The decor is cute and cozy, just like the cafe! A plus for that. I really wanted to like this place...but the food was subpar. I had the two hands burger, which was waaaaay too big for my hands to even grasp. The burger fell apart within seconds of biting into it. As for the taste, IT WAS WAY TOO SALTY!!!!!!!! They should definitely let us choose the salt level, as opposed to sprinkling the entire dish with Kosher salt. I read the other reviews and nobody mentions the extreme saltiness of the meal. It definitely wasn't just me because my other two friends experienced the same thing with their own entrees. Perhaps it's just our sensitive Asian taste buds kicking in, but it definitely ruined my entire experience at Two Hands. I also ordered a mimosa and didn't like it--way too bitter! I probably should've ordered the ole reliable matcha latte to neutralize my tongue. Final verdict - dos estrellas for dos manos ... I wouldn't come here again.
Our reservation was at 11:30. It is 1:11 and 2 people in our party have not been fed. The manager had a TERRIBLE attitude and treated our party with disrespect. They are not accommodating to any food allergies (even though we called in advanced to check) and after being yelled at for ordering mimosas for two people at a table with underage people (after being told that the policy only applied on the roof) we are STILL not given the two missing meals. Cool. We feel bad for the poor hostess and waiter who were victim of the kitchen and manager. They forgot chicken on our salad, put cheese on the salad after requesting not to, and put cheese on a sandwich after being told not to. Also no toilet paper in the bathroom. Not a happy birthday.
I come here for chicken and waffles, but I can break down a few other things for you, too! Chicken: brined, fried well, crispy, flavorful. 4/5 Waffles: light, crunchy, fluffy, yummy but gets soggy quickly with syrup. Eat it quick. 4/5 Grits: not super cheesy, but also not gummy, which I hate. Well seasoned. 4/5 Biscuits: buttery, but not flaky. A little dense. Hard and crisp on the outside. 3.5/5 Blueberry sticky bun - I think this was a one-time thing. This seems to have dried blueberries, which I hate in baked goods. It was not very sweet and dry. 2/5 I'd say go with the chicken and waffles - they're solid every time. Grits are also good as a side. It's not THE BEST chicken and waffles in NYC, but they're definitely top 10% in my opinion.
This is old school Greek food.  Great bread, succulent and tasty octopus, seasoned and well cooked sausage appetizer, excellent Greek Salad with lots of feta. large portions of mains including grilled shrimp, chicken skewers, pork cubes, and stuffed filet of sole all made for a very pleasant meal.  The only imperfection is that the pork cubes were a little too fatty.   Interestingly enough they don't serve coffee and I think they only have one dessert there (not baklava which we craved) and it was complimentary.   Staff was very helpful and attentive.  Now I see why whenever I have passed it, it is very crowded.
This review is based only on food and delivery not service. I have given this restaurant several chances, only because I rather support a local business versus going to chains. Unfortunately every single time I try to get delivery it has been over an hour and a half wait and whenever we ordered side dishes they have been inconsistent (the mac n cheese in particular). On the positive, their ribs have never disappointed and on a day I know I'll crave them I give myself a two hour window before ordering.
Babbo is our favorite restaurant in NYC. Black spaghetti is a must-have dish. Pistachio semifreddo was also soooo good. Just look at my pictures... Need I say more?
"My review is based on my interaction with the staff here when trying to book our wedding dinner only-no ceremony.  My group was less than 35, which they say they accommodate on their site, but they acted as if I was bothering them in their email response.  Instead of telling me if the date was available they wrote back and said ""Our wedding coordinator has other dates pending that month. Check back a month before your date and we will tell you if it's available, but I can't confirm until then. But we could give you a weeknight.""  I work in events and often have to keep clients on a ""soft hold"" when they inquire, but a soft hold is generally released when another client inquires about the date who wants to put a deposit down & is serious about booking. They might as well have came right out and said ""We have bridezilla's who will spend way more money here with a ceremony/200 person dinner so we'd rather keep the date open for them-thanks!"" Also-Who the hell plans their wedding dinner a month before? Are we supposed to send invitations with a 3 week notice to people who would need to fly in that say ""location TBD?"" Yeah, right.....sounds awesome. What a stupid thing to say.  Just a total WTF moment."
Never disappoints! Food is solid, drinks solid, Service is great albeit may be a bit slow sometimes.  Wait time can be a bit ridiculous but other than that love this place!
I ordered the stuffed grape leaves and the chicken souvlaki platter for take out. I was really excited to dig in because I was starving from my run and hadn't had grape leaves in so long. I'm not sure what the standard grape leaves are supposed to be like, since I've only had it one other time before, but I feel like it shouldn't be hard...which this one was. Flavorwise, it was just slightly sour but that was it. So disappointed! The chicken souvlaki platter was not much better. The chicken was dry and flavorless. The fries were good, while everything else was okay. I really expected better based on the reviews, but then again, I didn't get the dips that everyone raves about.
You gotta get the especial adobada -  not sure if it's on the menu but it's the must have when you visit here. Warning tho, that is not good if you're trying to diet, it's very greasy but very delicious. I'm giving this place 4 stars because my favorite taco place is still Tacos El Gordo in San Diego. The variety and flavors at Los Tacos isn't as good as El Gordo. Still a solid taco place.
I've had this place bookmarked for such a long time and I finally got to go!! I was not disappointed. A cute little wine bar in near Washington Square Park with long and great happy hour of food and wine. We ordered the wine flights that come with three glasses. They were delicious! For food, we ordered oysters (half east coast and half west coast). They were yummy! One of them was better than the other (forgot whether it was the east or the west.. The bigger one tasted better). We had the cheese plate as well that comes with a lot of unlimited bread (yay I love bread!), prosciutto, salami, and a whole bunch of other things. It was a lot of delicious stuff on that plate including the cheese. Definitely visiting again very very soon to try their other dishes!
Awesome pizza shop. They only accept cash.... and let me tell you!!!! I can't wait 'til I go back there their pizza is like none other, very tasty, fresh and succulent. Staff is also great especially their security guy at the door. Very helpful, even chips in to have you seated, places orders for you and brings your orders right over when its ready..... Great location and great prices for great food!
3.5 stars. Went there for dinner- service was pretty disorganized (they need more waitresses) so took 20 mins before anyone came over to take our order. We had: Steamed dumplings-good Pajeon - badly burnt, could not taste any kimchi Bibimbap - best dish Kalbi - oversauced and really really sweet Would I come back? No
Foodiwse, these guys are doing really good things here. Had brunch - found the menu to be rather typical. But once the food came out, it was typical done very very well. Good job guys!
Very disappointed that they fry everything in the same oils. With a seafood allergy, my waiter was very on point and on top of it to make sure I didn't get anything that may be cross contaminated. However after speaking to him and realizing that they cook everything in the same oils, I was very sad to realize that what I actually had planned to eat, I couldn't eat.  Would try it again as everything I did have was flavorful and yummy. Really wish they'd keep fritters to diff oils. Smh.
"Really wanted to like this place. My friend and I were looking for a fun place to grab a higher end dinner than we normally eat. I'm in town for just the week. Unfortunately this place seems more like a club than a restaurant. The restaurant is super cool looking. But the music is downright awful. I don't know who chose the playlist but if I'm going to pay a hundred bucks or more for a meal I don't want to be listening to bad pop music and radio nonsense. Also the music was absurdly loud. If you want to be a club, be a club, but you're a restaurant so people need to be able to have a conversation without yelling over music. We had a 9:15 reservation but were still given a buzzer and asked to wait with no acknowledgement of how strange that is. If you have a reservation why should you have to wait? Anyways after 5-10 min we were seated.  As for the food... the sweet potato ravioli and the chicken meatballs were definite standouts. Although nothing about them really wowed me. The grilled cheese dumplings were good but nothing special. The roast beef ""carpaccio"" was unimpressive, I thought it would actually be carpaccio but it was just roast beef and seemed too low end even with the way it was plated. We were still hungry after though dishes so we ordered the lobster mac and cheese. It was highly disappointing. We searched for lobster and there were no joke 2 pieces in this $18 plate of mac and cheese. Pretty ridiculous.  I will say our server was lovely and helpful. And all the other staff (aside from the hostesses) were friendly and helpful.  Then to top off our OK experience, I got food poisoning from something at the restaurant (I noticed the chicken meatballs were still a little pink on the inside but thought it was just the lighting). Woke up in the middle of the night sick to my stomach and that was the only meal I'd had within 12 hours.  Super disappointed in this place."
Appropriately named for the Southern style pies, Biscuit honey & hot Sauce  fried chicken that they're churning out of here and right onto my thighs! I can tell you that they have one of the best Bourbon Pecan Pies I've yet to taste and I normally do not like Pecan Pie but will make it an exception for Pies and Thigh Version of Bourbon Southern Pecan Pie so much so that I decided to buy a whole pie for the families Sunday Dinner, this Pie right here is jamming with the perfect amount of sweet, crunchy, salt, chocolaty Bourbon goodnes add a dollop of Whip Cream and its Heaven on earth, yes that good. If your hungry get the Honey Butter biscuit & Chicken with hot sauce this was all the rage with my boys so much so I decided to get me one on the next visit, this is a very rich, heavy and thick sandwich but very very good if your hungry - I leave this to my boys. I also bought a Chicken & Catfish box as a takeout order since this location is tight, cramped and small and not my thing for comfortable dining especially eating southern style fare loaded up with butter honey and all the other fixings. You need room to expand and spread out eating this stuff and a comfortable pair of stretch pants on too. I didn't bother checking the actual orders before I left I took my packaged bag and went home but when I got home the Catfish box hurt my feelings; when I opened it there was about two sorry skimpy pieces of fried baby catfish in the box for the price of $14.25 - I was shocked! The chicken box was better but wasn't mine. We agreed that we're not doing take out here again for the food other than the loaded Chicken Biscuit & Whole pies.  The menu however looks promising and has lots of my southern favorites included on it so I would like to visit here on an off day/hour simply because I don't do excessive crowds and tight seating at the same time.
Apart from the Long waiting time for Ippudo, I have no complain. Hence, just try to go at non-peak hours.  My favourite on the menu has to be the Akamaru Modern ramen with garlic oil and please add the $2 Nitamago to treat yourself! If you feel that you wanna have more, do add a kaedama for another $2 for a self-inducing food coma experience!  The Black Forest desert that comes with pistachio ice cream is delicious. It has outdone the other Ippudos in Asia.  I just wish that Ippudo Westside would open til wee hours as 11.30pm is a tad too early for the city that never sleeps. ;)
One of the worst experiences at a restaurant, get served our main course with bean sauce but not beans. We ask and are told that the beans were spilled and would take long to make again. When we ask for a manager we are told the beans will come out in 5 mins. We wait 10-15 mins and get served another small cup of bean sauce with no beans. We then talk to the manager and get brought uncooked beans, literally couldn't crush them with our fingers. Manager takes off 5 brunches out of a party of 10 but end up trying to charge us only $9 less then what we would have paid originally. They then threaten to call police because we wouldn't agree to pay what they were charging. Must have thought we wouldn't noticed but luckily we caught it. Incredible how a manager disappears when things get tough and their servers have to try to solve. I've been to the mama juana in secaucus and the service and food is much better. Should think about cleaning the management at the Bronx restaurant.
Bullied at queens bully!! I have to say I was beyond disappointed in my experience here.  From the very get go we had issues.  The first bottle of wine we ordered wasn't available. The second we ordered came and unfortunately the server had no idea on how to open a bottle.  He never cut the foil so it was jagged ripped at the top. When opening the bottle even further he clearly has no knowledge of using a wine key and popped the cork out with extreme force.   Our next issue had to be one of the items we ordered. The ceviche stuffed avocado.  The dish was delicious but on the menu it clearly states it comes with fresh naan bread.  When it arrived we asked and we're told it did not and we read the menu wrong.  We once again asked a second time and the server came back and said we just checked the menu and it does not come with naan.   We asked to see a menu and pointed it that it did INDEED come with naan !   Never should a restaurant argue with you and be knowledgeable of their own menu.   One of my friends ordered a drink and asked to substitute the liquor which was accommodated.  In the second round she was then told by who I assume was the manager she couldn't change the liquor, they do not Do that (consistency is key).    Another friend ordered the brisket dinner and was served the brisket sandwich.    The pulled pork sandwich came so extremely dry it had no bbq sauce on it at all and the fries were cold!  Now here comes my huge issue.  We were a party of 5 asked for 2 checks they came incorrectly but that this point we just wanted to leave.   What blew my mind was these checks had an automatic TWENTY percent gratuity applied.  Not only was that not listed on the menu I have never in my life been forced a twenty percent gratuity.  Every time it's added it's 15-18%.    Overall a very underwhelming experience for a very beautiful restaurant and concept which is so upsetting because I had such high hopes and convinced so many friends to go try it.   I hope it's growing pains and they figure these things out but I can't see myself returning until they do
Afternoon delight. My brother and Sisterinlaw brought me here to one of their favorite restaurants. To my surprise I'd never been to this particular place. It was packed with lunchtime clientele. We started off with some delicious freshly made calamari   Then we had the scrumptious grilled octopus. We had had grilled Branzinos for our entrees with lemon potatoes and sweet delicious beets. The entire meal was quickly and perfectly prepared.  The octopus was sweet and tender.  Must get it again. Can't wait to return with my special someone.
"I came here off recommendations, with high expectations. But they were not met, let me tell you why: 1. Poor service. 2. Poor communication between servers and bar 3. Food is very greasy 4. Sauces were drowned in oil 5. Long wait for ""fast"" food  6. Managerial staff standing around, not concerned with guests eating experience 7. One person working really hard: bus boy. 8. No one cleans table at all through your meal, we cleaned it up ourselves.  All food and scraps sits at the table throughout.  9. Waiters waitresses do not introduce themselves during a shift change  10. No one asked how our meal was throughout  11. We had to ask for our drinks repeatedly 12. No one came to collect the check and credit card at the end. We had to request it. 13. Head off shrimp is NOT DEVEINED."
Lartusi, you have my heart. This has been my number one resultant for years. I can't get enough. Even when I was a child, I was obsessed with this restaurant!!! For an appetizer, I love the roasted beets. For pasta, my GO TO is the Garganelli - mushroom ragu, ricotta salata .. and for an entree I usually like to switch it up between the steak or chicken , sometimes fish. Overall, this place is amazing!!! The food is outstanding. The staff is awesome and the atmosphere is kicking any time of the week. Definitely one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city hands down.
Got there on Friday night, gave my name to the girl in front for my party of 3 and waited about 10-15 min for our seats. They can also text you when your table is ready if the wait is longer and you dont want to stick around. Good wasn't bad. I didn't go with the  'The Boil Bag' mix. The menu had lots of items with looked tempting and after some contemplation went with the fried oyster sliders, Mac n cheese ans stole some of friends fries.  The Mac and cheese and fries were really good. Fried oysters not as much, I think would rather much go with fresh osyters in that case. Would go back to try thr bag mix when Im ready to get down and dirty.  Oh yea...its cash only! But they also have an atm nearby and in store.
Great food. Pay before you eat so you leave when you are ready. Pretty good food for a small price. Outdoor cafeteria style seating. Can be annoying to find a spot to sit. Weak drinks lol and cash only.
I really wanted to like this place as I am a big fan of tagines. We walked in and the restaurant was half empty. We asked if there was a table for two after waiting at the bar with no bartender for 10 minutes. The hostess asked us to wait a moment and never came back to let us know if there was a table for two at an half empty restaurant.  It felt very pretentious the minute we walked in.  We were very friendly from the minute we walked in so I am not sure where it went wrong. I would understand if the place was under staffed and the restaurant was busy but it was a half empty place. Maybe there were reservations for the empty seats, but as a hostess, its your responsibility to come back to the diner and let them if they can be seated or not? We waited another 10 minutes at the bar with no bartender and walked out. As we walked out, she looked at us and did not even say a word.  It's places like this that taints the the East Village's vibe.
Arrived around 8:30 on a Thursday and we were able to be seated immediately, which was nice. However, it was absolutely BOILING inside - it was an exceptionally hot day and all of the windows were open so obviously AC wouldn't have been efficient, but seriously when it's that hot close the damn windows and crank it.  My friend and I ordered a bottle of Lambrusco ($34) and it was served to us in, like, water glasses, which was just bizarre. And yes, I know Lambrusco can be served in tumblers but that's not what these were. Did the restaurant not have proper glassware? Very strange. It was also chilled more than it should have been. For such a cheap bottle of wine though I can't complain too much. We shared the fried calamari and zucchini to start, which I didn't like at all. The calamari was really, really chewy and not tender at all, the breading was kinda gross and soggy and the whole thing was too salty.  For our entrees, I ordered the Penne Tre Porcellini (pancetta, prosciutto, and sausage in cream sauce) - $17, and my friend had one of the nightly specials, which was gnocchi in a pesto sauce - $19. In this place's defense, the pastas were delicious and the one thing they did right. However, portion sizes were, as many other Yelpers have said, fairly small. I wasn't starving so it was okay, but definitely a lot smaller than I'm used to for Italian.  For dessert, we split the flourless chocolate cake (free with a Yelp check-in), which was very, very MEH. I expect flourless cakes/tortes/whatever to be really dense, and it was oddly not. It honestly tasted like regular chocolate cake from a mix.  Service was fine, but not enough to earn a third star.  TL;DR: Excellent pastas but rather small portions. No other reason to come. Will not return.
Disappointed in this place. Made an Open Table reservation and noted we were coming for my husband's birthday brunch. Showed up and the friendly hostess asked me if my husband knew that they knew about his birthday, like they'd do something special as a surprise. Then nothing happened. So someone dropped the ball. I was expecting some sort of recognition of my husband's birthday bc we were there for a special occasion and they knew about it in advance.  Also the menu on their website link on Yelp wasn't updated or it was inaccurate. When I checked it out for Saturday brunch, the online menu said one brunch drink comes with your meal. Saturday brunch does not come with one drink with your meal and it also seems they don't do an official brunch on Saturdays. Also somehow we were charged $13.50 for their brunch drinks that were listed as $11 on the menu. If it wasn't for my husband's birthday I would have asked the waiter about the menu and pricing but I didn't want to make a thing of it given the occasion.  Our server was ok and the food was ok. He wasn't really around that much but was pleasant enough when he did visit our table. I've been to many brunch places in nyc and nj and this one was average considering the prices. I had the egg white omelet with goat cheese and kale. It was good but nothing amazing. Not worth the amount they charge- $17. My husband had the western scramble with beans and avocado for $18. He liked it but was disappointed no home fries or anything came with it. The drinks were good, though the prices were steep and it appeared we were overcharged. I liked the open space design and expected the noise because I read reviews before booking this place.  There are many better places to go so I wouldn't come back here again. It's too bad they didn't recognize my husband's birthday bc that would have made the overall experience a little better. Also not having the most up to date menu online is a bummer as I expected one thing but got another.
"I had such a bad experience here but first let me say that In terms of decor it's a nice little space that play r&b slow jams and has a lovely backyard. Last week two of my friends and I stopped by after hearing so much about it and omg our waiter was so nasty. We sat at a table near the front door that had no menus so I simply walked up to the bar and asked one of the bartenders. He scoffed at me with this condescending tone saying, ""I'll be right with you."" Then, when he arrived, he gave my friends menus and completely ignored me because he was irritated by the whole ordeal. It wasn't even that serious. So I just got up and left in the middle of the whole transaction. I won't be back."
Cool bar. On the quiet side. Name was interesting so I Stop by for a drink with my friend. We decided to ordered the smoke salmon and it was delicious. I ordered tempranillo red wine (not too sweet not to dry) just what I was looking for. My friend ordered a Pinot grigio white wine and then she ordered a second one, that a good sign.
Food isn't bad. Pros and cons all around.  Pros  - The food is quite good Cons - I read a lot about service issues on Yelp and they are justified. I've seen the server act like a douche to several customers on the subject of seating. Just bad manners and not very hospitable amor friendly. He was kind to us but he needs a bit of work or face non repeat customers.  - I think they need to slim down the menu. There are far too many options. Felt like the Cheesecake Factory with never ending choices.
Came here for lunch with a friend a little while ago. The place is nice, looks sleek, and the food was good. Overpriced (especially if you order cocktails), but hey, it's the Financial District. The issue, like people noted before, is that the service was pretty lousy. We were seated promptly and offered drinks right away, but it was often a struggle just to get a hold of our waiter. For instance, it took us fifteen minutes just to flag him down for the check. I think had we sat at the bar it would've been a better experience.
I came here after the blizzard. The restaurant was cold and I had to wear my jacket. The backround music I found annoying at times because it sounded like a man whining in Arabic with instruments in the backround. The food, well what can I say.. I had tbe lamb merguez as an entree. They brought it out 5 minutes after I ordered it. The only hot thing I got was the pita bread which was made fresh. Everything else was obviously premade and cold (my lamb). I had the same dish at the Bedawi Cafe.. It was much better. I didn't finish the lamb cause honestly it wasn't very good and cold. The Hummus and salad were good.. but hard to go wrong with that. I had semolina cake for dessert. It was tasteless except the honey flavor it had. I need something more exciting than that. The Turkish Cafe again have had better elsewhere.. it was VERY bitter and I put lots of sugar inside. The waiter was nice though he agrued with me when I told him that I wanted to get a salad before the meal. He said let me bring your food and then you can decide if you want more. Honestly I was in the mood to try some authentic salads but when he said that I just said to myself forget it. The restaurant is clean but better looking in the back area where we sit than in the front where you first walk in. One more thing they DON'T accept credit cards.. HATE THAT!!
I found feathers on my chicken wings I dumped out all foods  I will never eat here again
Back Again!  We came here for dinner three nights ago with four friends. We all enjoyed our meals and came back for some lighter fare. We had gyoza, pork bun, cucumber salad and tofu salads. It all was excellent! Not a lot of room to sit and eat but that just makes it cozy.
I've been here twice.  It's mediocre. I'm not very impressed by the food, or the wine. Which has left me not wanting to go back. Too much great Italian nearby to settle.
5 stars if there wasn't a 2 hour wait on basically every single night of the day.  Major tip - come during lunch if you can, or go before opening and you'll probably most likely be the first group in.  Pork Buns - you haven't had a true ippudo experience unless you've had their pork buns.  It is hands down the best pork buns ever. Other ramen shops can not complete.  The buns do not fall apart.  The bun is soft and fluffy, and the pork belly is perfect.  You must indulge in them.  They are pricey (2 for 9$), but its all a part of the experience and so worth it.  Akamaru Modern: My favorite ramen - noodles always cooked to perfection.  They use straight noodles, which I prefer.  Soup stock is flavorful without going overboard. It comes with two slices of pork, mushroom.  I wish it came with an egg - but for an extra 2$, you could get a pretty perfectly made egg.  The whole bowl of ramen just ties together completely.  Some might get need the extra noodles, but I think the portion is just perfect.  The spicy ramen they offer - Karaka-men is pretty good also - its not overly spicy where you can't appreciate the taste of the soup.   Once you walk in, they greet you loudly - and it's a cozy spot. There's a bar with ramen bar top and you can get your pork buns there.  Major shout out to the cucumber appetizer as well (amazing). Worth the wait (even if I wish I was shorter), because I've waited at least 3x, and I will always wait.  It may be pricey, but pretty standard for the price of ramen in NYC - and this is by far one of the better spots to try. Plus - they take card!
I was excited to try this restaurant. It looks very nice from the outside with outdoor sittings which is a huge plus for the summer.  Since it's newly opened with good reviews, I was not surprised that there was a wait for the tables. We waited for about 20mins. The host was very friendly. She is new and learning but she was very polite.  Things mentioned above are all positive. At the end of the day, it's a restaurant- it's the food that truly matters.  I don't understand how a Thai restaurant could mess up Pad Kee Mao aka drunken noodle. It was so bad, not only that it was not spicy at all, but also has no flavors. The drink wasn't good either. At $13 per drink, I'd expect it to be better than some Cancun all inclusive resort quality.  I would really want to like this restaurant and I hope it could improve. I provided my feedback to the waitress and hopefully she could let the chef know. Side note - My boyfriend and I both had a bit of stomachache shortly after eating, not sure why.
I am pretty serius about food in general, but when it comes to pizza, even more. These are my 2 judging rules: 1. In a new place always try margherita first; 2. Pizza has to be eaten hot! I couldn't judge a delivered pizza, that would be unfair. Juliana's margherita it's great. That right mix of crunchy and softness. You can beat they have a fast turnaround of that dough... Ingredients taste authentic too. The staff it's great too, very friendly and polite.
I always wanted to try this place and decided to pop in on a Memorial Day where they were running their brunch specials. Average prices for brunch dishes $11-12 - typical and drinks were about $12. They had a build your own Bloody Mary selection. Tacos run about $4-$5 each depending on if seafood or not. We ordered three tacos and a Chilequile which you can pick a meat. Everything tastes amazing! The tacos were great and I actually work for a restaurant company that owns a Mexican and a taco shop so I know Mexican food and I know tacos. I would say this place was great and I understand the price point because I work in the industry.  So why the 3 stars? Because of service - I live a few blocks away and was willing to see if this could be one of my go to spots - I was trying to squirt out some hot sauce and the top came off and started all over my clothes and face and arms and food. They took my dish away because it was covered in hot sauce - they offered me 1 free drink and my friend ordered one because I was getting a free drink.  The manager apologized but I was covered in sauce all over and thankfully I was wearing dark clothes but I was thinking imagine I wore white!  Anyway we got the bill and I was charged for the dish that I could not eat and my friend was charged for his drink which he only ordered because they gave me an extra drink and encouraged him to order one.  So I was a bit disappointed that my ruined clothes which I had to wear for the next 4 hours was covered in hot sauce and all I got was 1 drink.  You may say it's petty but walk around smelling like vinegar and drop $82 on 6 tacos and a shared brunch dish and 3 drinks - tell me how you walk away from that experienced?
Saddest happy hour. After ordering a dozen $1 oysters, we tried ordering a second round. The waitress told us they ran out of blue points but we can pay full price for the other oysters they have... Must have been lying to us because we were the only diners in the restaurant and somehow we ate through all the hh oysters?? And it was just bad customer service to offer us no other option but to pay for $3 oysters. I was excited to find a place that serves oysters by my home but I was not impressed. They weren't as fresh as other reviewers have mentioned. We also tried the grilled oysters and they were pretty tasty, I'll give them that.
"The bartender was rather rude to us. We came in on a Saruday morning and all of the tables were full so she said we could sit at the bar or the table that had the outdoor board menu on it. She said they were all done with it so we said if they did't mind we would like to sit at the table and then with some attitude she said ""Fine. I'll clear it off."" and then after a few minutes of us standing and waiting she finally went over and picked up the board and put it outside.  The server was friendlier but still not the nicest person to interact with. I liked my food,  but my date picked at his Oyster Mushroom Hash, which came highly recommended, he didn't like the flavor or the textures. Said it tasted reheated.  I don't expect to ever go back."
This place is horrible. The food is so small. Not even big enough for a kid in daycare. The waiter poured water in my orange juice... how do you get those 2 mixed up. It took extremely too long for me to get my food. Imagine waiting a long time and they bring out your food and it's super small...
I loove the vibe of this place, so beautifully decorated. The food menu is short but really good!!! I had a soupy bean, prosciutto dish that was incredible and actually very filling. The cab I got wasn't my favorite but sometimes that's the luck of the draw! If you're in the area, this is a great spot to check out for after work drinks or I guess they do live music too.
We went with our group on a Wednesday for lunch. We got in quick but it took about 45 minutes for them to prepare the food and bring it to the table. We were absolutely hungry and the wait time just made it worse. But the quality of food was amazing. I loved their dumplings and bibimbap. Definitely recommend the sizzling hot bibimbap. Other than the wait time, I think it's a nice spot to visit.
I had such high expectations for this place based on the great reviews. I went there for lunch with my boss and a client.  Food service: for lunch we waited 1 hour for the food to arrive. The waiter never came to us with an update. Just took our order, poured water, and came back an hour later when food was ready. Food: ordered the minute steak open face lunch. I never had anything like nor do I ever want to have a repeat. It was sirloin steak cut into tiny pieces stir fryed witb mushrooms placed in a square thin bread. It was like eating a meat pie. Very very disappointed.  Waiter never came back to ask how it was. I was with a client otherwise would've complained to Manager. It was an embarrassing lunch.
"Grade A solid artery clogging Southern comfort food at a reasonable price. Came here today (Sunday) @ 10.30 to find that we had to wait 30-45 minutes for a table for two. Ended up grabbing a coffee at Coffee Bean across the street. Wait was about 30 minutes, which was fine.  The service was great, honestly, despite the crazy Sunday crowd. Waiter even poured my Coffee Bean americano into a mason jar (I think they appreciate the fact that we wait that long, which is NICE!).  The menu is comprehensive enough for brunch and chock full of Southern comfort food. I got the Croque Madame ($16) while my friend had the sausage gravy fried chicken ($15). Both were EXCELLENT. The white sauce for the croque madame was delightfully cheesy enough without being too salty. It's a hard balance to strike, honestly. Saying this after having tried a bunch of ""Southern""-style foods in the city and elsewhere. It's also a massive portion for New York City brunch. The sausage in the gravy was amazing; I'm not sure where they get their sausages from but it was great. It was like a nice blend of mushroom soup and sausage, yum. The only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because of the insane crowd on Sunday. The food is great and well worth the money, but I'm not sure if it's worth the 1.5-2 hour wait time some folks experience."
3.5 Stars It's a beautiful, warmly lit restaurant with a hint of upscale and a bit of a trendy vibe. I thought the charm of the place came from it's atmosphere. I came here to try the Restaurant Week menu. Ilili has decent Mediterranean food, presented appealingly, but definitely not the best if we go by taste. They allowed a pick of two appetizers (which was great), one entree and one dessert.  The moussaka was my favorite appetizer, the cold eggplant was pretty tasty. The hummus was ok, the falafel squares were a bit dry and the tahini sauce was ok. The mouhamara was good especially paired with the little strips of cut radish, but it was on the sweeter side because of the pomegranate molasses. A small basket of pita bread was brought, I found it to be a little thin and more floury on the outside than I liked. The dishes went down better with pita though. The entrees were
8pm reservation for 4 on a Saturday night. Upon arrival,  told it would be a 90 min wait. Fine. Went down the street for an appetizer and a cocktail, returned at 9:15, grabbed a drink at the bar figuring we would be seated shortly. Soon, soon soon. Stood at that bar 2 more hrs. It is cramped. My friend, who looks like a handsome version of lurch from the Addams family, may have lurked creepily close to a group that had already paid, while proclaiming loudly that one of them wanted to f him. Someone else in my party (me) may have called out an older couple who were handsy, asserting they were clearly having an affair bc ppl that old aren't that into each other. Yes, if you were at lupa on Saturday, we were those ppl. My apologies, but it's not our fault. The 3 hour wait and the delicious cocktails did us in. Btw, the cocktails are delicious. Try the honey bourbon thing. Yum. They sent over a comp prosciutto appetizer, but 6 thin slices of meat, while delectable, cannot tide over 4 starving drinking ppl. Admittedly, by the time we were seated, we weren't even that hungry anymore. Plus, my recollections may be a bit foggy. There was charcuterie. The lengua was the standout. There were several pastas, the gnocchi and an orchiette with duck ragu were the best. There were chicken and quail dishes that were well received. We skipped dessert. I am confident the food deserves 4-5 stars, just wish I could remember it.
Fairly tasty food, okay service and a bit on the pricier side. We arrived as a party of 6 with a reservation on a Friday evening, and the place was reasonably busy. We had two orders of calamari to start, which came about 20 minutes apart during the meal, and without marinara sauce (at least until we asked). For the entrees, I split a platter of lobster and crawfish and added an extra half pound of crawfish. The flavor from the Boil mix was decent, although you had to apply a second layer of sauce to really get the flavor, and I guess I just didn't like the messiness of dealing with the bucket + gloves + bibs, etc. The service was overall disinterested and rushed in general. I get that there's a time limit, but overall, the experience was a little uncomfortable, even with the decent food, and the price point was a bit high ($30/lb of lobster is a bit on the steeper end). For a concept that requires very little service (the food is plopped in front of you in a bag), I found the meal overall fairly underwhelming and too expensive.
"I chose Kobeyaki from among the other affordable eateries in the area because it has an ""A"" DOH rating, affordable prices, and vegetarian offerings. I wouldn't go again. My teriyaki grilled vegetable bowl was excessively salty even for teriyaki. The tofu is supposed to be crispy but mine was rather soggy. I ate my food just until I was no longer hungry, then I just left the rest. Not very appetizing. The staff cleaned the tables because they were sticky, but they were still sticky, like permanently sticky. Yuck."
This is a comment on the lounge Bouncers at the from Tonight. June 17th I do hope MGMT sees this comment.  After having dinner at an upscale restaurant in Manhattan  Went to this lounge with 8 extremely well dressed people & 1 person who had a slacks shoes & non dress shirt. Which didn't fall into the new dress code. The downstairs bouncers at the front were rude and pretentious.  Thought they were literally going to hit my brother for going around the rope when no was on line or gave direction as to which way to walk.  Please send you security/Bouncers to etiquette and to interpersonal people skills class. Lost my business due to this!!!!
Excellent Italian supermarket with various Italian restaurants specialising in almost every type of Italian food. We tried the rooftop restaurant. Starting with Froze cocktails and Bruschetta followed by Fusili seafood pasta, chicken and eggplant, the food was excellent and complemented by the wide drink menu including many beers. Coffee was mediocre. The ambience on the rooftop was quite loud but casual and very pleasant in the afternoon sunshine. Tried not to spend too much downstairs and failed.
Worst service I have ever had in NYC. So bad we walked in and left. I had made a reservation a week prior. I arrived and the location was pretty empty which is surprising for the evening. I checked in and the host took us all across the restaurant to seat us in completely empty area in a corner that has a wall blocking the rest of the restaurant. It was the most bizarre thing I have ever expereince. Having friends in the restaurant industry its surprising the host wouldn't fill the front or middle part of the restaurant instead he put us literally in a corner.  There wasn't any server that came over to introduce themselves. There were three employees standing around and after some time of waiting we left. Why would a restaurant have three people standing around and not think to check on their only guest in the empty area.  I don't mind waiting in a busy restaurant for good food but this place was empty.
disappointed. this place is wack attack. deceiving when you walk in. chicken and waffle was sour, tacos were just slabs of bland meat and sauce. portions and meals are served by quantity not quality. i wish i could go back in time.
Bland bland bland , very bland . Soup was luke warm lemon grass chicken had no lemongrass tastes more like fermented beef . Pr9ob old meat and was warm not hot . Save ur money eat else where many great eats in Chinatown
Best Thai restaurant at the UES! Wow just amazing food and beautiful restaurant! There's definitely a lot of thought put into the decor! The clay pot fried rice was a favorite! Usually I am skeptical about dishes that have a little bit of every kind of meat but the scallop, shrimp, chicken, Chinese sausage, and mushroom were QUALITY. The dish used a lot of sweet soy sauce. It caramelized the meat and crisped the rice. Super flavorful dish! I would go back just to have that! The penang curry with crispy duck was delicious too! The duck was so crispy that you can't tell if it was de-boned.
"I can summarize this as ""inexcusable rudeness"". We, party of four, had a reservation for 7:30.  Two of us arrived at about 7:28.  The other two arrived at 7:32 and were told the others hadn't arrived yet, despite having checked in with the hostess.  We had resolved this ourselves by 7:34 and presented ourselves for our reservation - and were told that it was a 10-15 minute wait.  Fine, not an issue. 20 minutes later, one of us went to talk to the hostess.  He was were told that ""no table had opened up.  20 minutes later, another of us went to talk to the hostess.  He was told that ""no table had opened up"".  15 minutes later, another of us went to talk to the hostess.  She was told that ""no table had opened up"".  She asked how long it would be, and the hostess wasn't able to say. We had sat there for an hour.  We talked to the hostess a grand total of four times during that hour, so it's not like we were bugging her constantly.  We were scrupulously polite until we walked out in disgust. The hostess never came to talk to us.  No apology was extended.  We weren't offered anything - not an appetizer, a drink, nothing.  The word ""sorry"" was never mentioned.  The hostess treated us consistently like we were an annoyance. We ended up going elsewhere (Quantum Leap - great!) and eating - at 9PM.  I had to miss the show I had rather wanted to see afterwards. I've been going to Westville East for years now.  I have recommended these restaurants to my friends, and now I regret it. I am quite sure I will never go back to any of these restaurants."
We got takeout from the takeout window--a vegan chorizo burrito and kale salad. Both were extremely salty, even for my husband, who has a high tolerance for salt. My kale salad was so salty it was inedible. I ended up cooking a pot of quinoa to add to it to cut the salt. Very disappointed in what seemed like a good neighborhood restaurant.
"I feel like the party pooper, but given the 5-star only reviews of Bar Omar, I feel like I need to share my experience, which - food wise - was definitely not on par with what is described in the 10 current reviews here.  A friend and I shared a Brik au Thon for starters. It was essentially like a deep-fried ""Tuna Hot-pocket"". It was not bad, it just didn't have much flavor besides, well, a deep-fried dough-pocket with Tuna. Presentation was also just that - a hot-pocket on a plate. It would have done well with *something* to give it some flavor and a little more appetite appeal.  For our main we shared the Roasted Chicken CousCous. I was really surprised when the dish came out on three separate plates: One with plain couscous, one bowl with chunky vegetables in a broth, and one plate with one whole fried chicken thigh. The latter meant I had to spend a good amount of time trying to cut chunks of meat off the chicken thigh (IF you're going to serve ""cut it yourself meat"" for couscous, at least make it a breast!?) The broth with veggies was just watery and without much flavor - Just sort of a plain vegetable soup with a few chunky-cut veggies in it (potato and carrot) I did not taste the slightest hint of Moroccan cuisine anywhere in the dish, nor did my friend. And again presentation left a lot (anything!) to be desired. The mix-your-own-cous-cous could be a nice concept - but it needs to be more exciting that this. In both flavor and presentation. Food-wise the experience was disappointing to say the least. Absolutely nothing to complain about in terms of service - very nice and attentive. Also, the portions making up the self-mix couscous were generous. And to Bar Omar's credit we were asked for feedback by the manager (?) which I always think is a smart move when you've just opened. We were politely honest about not being impressed with the (lack of) flavors. Full disclosure: they had only been open a week or two and were clearly still working out the kinks.  I loved Cadaques, which occupied this spot until recently, so I really would like to love Bar Omar in its place, but if I have a 2nd visit it is going to have to be a lot better than the first impression was."
This place is so good! The food was really great and petite portions but it filled me up. Really good to chill and hang out there. The drinks were delish and so cute. The staff what really on top of it and SUPER nice and friendly-- 5 stars for service alone, good food was a bonus!
Really classy looking place without being over the top. This place was perfect for a small group and they TAKE reservations (which is rare in NYC). Came here based on a recommendation from a friend and so glad we tried this place out. On a Friday night it was fairly busy and the food came out quickly -- which was perfect because I was starving!  Out of my group of four we ordered Pad Kee Mao, Khao Soi, Claypot Fish, Pad Thai, Kra Pow Gai Kai Dow. We also had the vegetable spring rolls and pork belly as the appetizers. All of the food was amazing and we were stuffed afterwards. Kind of reminds me of being in Thailand again...
This place is located right near Union Square. Its a nice place to grab drinks at the bar (both during Happy hour and post HH). They played good music and enough room at the bar or tables. They had HH oysters and appetizers. There was a little mix up with my bill but the GM quickly rectified it, which I appreciate. I will be coming back due to their customer service, good vibes, and food!
Service was great! Toast was a little too toasty, but other than that it was quite enjoyable. The scrambled eggs with bacon are great! And $5 mimosas are awesome.
Hands down the best Italian cuisine in NYC!! Every dish from appetizer to dessert was delicious. Ambiance goes well with the food and my experience with their service was a pleasure!! Keep up the great work guys and God bless!!
Cons: Overpriced, uninspired and confusing dishes. We got the mee goreng and nasi rice dish. Add $7 to get three rubbery shrimp to the dish So disappointing and unrefined. No authenticity in the taste, and I would know, I am from SE Asia.  Pros: Cute decor, chicken wings and prawn chips were good. The sambal chili was good too. If you just get some apps you might not be disappointed.
One of my favorite places to go for bbq. I love that the uni bibimbap too. I usually get their for japenese style bbq with vegetable . This place foods are very delicious!!!
Worst delivery experience I've ever had. The delivery was late and when the delivery woman came her phone was not working properly and she proceeded to yell at me and curse in Korean under her breath. She was upset that she had to come upstairs and deliver the food.  Wow..
"I'm not one to write a bad review, but I just have to say it - Cent'Anni is deceptively mediocre. The first time we came here, we were really underwhelmed by the pasta dishes which seemed to be overdone pasta with out-of-the-can sauces and little seasoning. We gave it one more try and were again disappointed. I literally heard a woman at the table next to me say ""this just seems like... normal pasta"". I think the place is a big con and not worth another penny."
Charming new restaurant in Cobble Hill! Great ambiance and decor - I love the wooden planks on the walls and the amazing craft beer selection.  We shared the pork belly and sweet corn fritters as well as the ugly poutine to start. The ugly poutine was amazing! Juicy pieces of shredded duck confit, brown gravy and cheese melted over fries. Not exactly poutine since it just had regular cheese, not cheese curds, but I liked their take on it. The fritters were mediocre - they were pretty dry, especially the pork belly inside it. I think pork belly should always be juicy from all the natural fats, but this dish really didn't do it justice. The fritters came with a tiny smear of some kind of sauce (which looked a bit questionable - a bright yellow sauce that somewhat resembled congealed chicken fat) but if it had more sauce it might have helped the dish. For mains, we ordered the chicken and waffles and the ugly duckling burger. The chicken and waffles were pretty good - the chicken was cooked nicely so it stayed moist inside, and the waffle was pretty good too. The burger had nice big strips of bacon inside but it was really strange that it had absolutely no sauce in there, no mayo or anything. That, coupled with the fact that my burger was actually well-done instead of the medium I asked for, made the burger extremely dry. I had to ask for some garlic aioli to just add SOMETHING to make it easier to eat.  Overall, a great addition to the neighborhood, but as a new restaurant they still have a few kinks to work out.
I'm conflicted on how I feel about 49 Monroe. I loved the setting and the vibes, which is why I decided to come here, but the food was pretty underwhelming. I came here with a friend on a weekday night and were seated right away. I was pretty excited for my dinner as I walked through what looked like a secret jungle hideout, littered with plants and fairy lights, to our table. The service was friendly and attentive and everything on the menu seemed pretty appetizing. The menu definitely had a mix of European influence but I wasn't sure if they specialized in French, Italian or Spanish.  We started with the steak tartare (it was decent), and a serving of patatas bravas. As a lover of anything potatoes, I was pretty disappointed with the patatas bravas. They came in a big basket but they were cut too small (they're usually bite-sized wedges) and were soggy. The dip that came with it tasted sour, which threw me off a little. Then came the steamed mussels, but it was mostly shell as a lot of the meat had already fallen off and those we could savage were very shrivelled up. To me, that's a sign the mussels lacked quality and freshness. The most decent item we had was probably the shrimp scampi. It was garlicky and flavorful.  Overall, this seems like a great spot for an intimate dinner but my first experience here was mediocre and I'm still indecisive of whether I should give this spot another try.
This is hands down my favorite Greek restaurant in Astoria and NYC for that matter. The food is absolutely delicious and the waiters and staff are great!! Their is always a long line and you have to wait to get a table especially on the weekends but trust me, it is worth it! Everyone knows how good the food is, that's why!
Da Claudio's is an inviting space that has delicious food and drinks. I've been here a few times with friends after work and it always delivers. Yesterday, we sat at the bar, and what was supposed to be just a drink or 2 turned into nearly 5 hours. You never feel rushed, the food is delicious and fresh (everything from the grilled octopus and crostini's to the black ink pasta and the salads), and the service is excellent. The bartender Gabriel, who really was more of a mixologist, after asking what type of base liqueur I most liked, created drinks for us that weren't on the menu. We named it the Serendipity, so be sure to ask for it if you like gin, pomegranate and mint.  If I were to make one suggestion it would be to play music that was a tad more lively , but that's just one person opinion. This place is a real gem in the financial district.
So I'm sitting here. Trying to order food and two of the items on the regular menu that I've ordered are not available. Why are you open?!?! Pissed that I've already ordered a bottle of wine since I could have ordered this bottle in the restaurant that I'm actually going to have dinner in. Extremely pissed!!!!!!!!
Poor service. We had appetizers for an hour before entrees were served. When we asked about our entrees, the server gave excuses and few updates. After the entrees were served, the eggs in our Green Shakshuka were raw. The manager made a nice gesture in deducting the cost of the Green Shakshuka from the bill, but the server and everyone else were not even the least bit apologetic   for the late entrees and uncooked food. Disappointing.
Place is great to bring visitors. I think the atmosphere makes the pizza taste better because it's a super Brooklyn vibe. Without that, I dare to say the pizza is a tad overrated due to a major BK circlejerk. I recommend.
My wife and I were in the mood for some Korean BBQ and found this place. The interior of the restaurant was very industrial and modern, it was really nice.  Everything was great! The food was fresh and loaded with original flavor. The food came out in a timely manner and was reasonably priced. The Staff was very friendly and attentive. We came for a late lunch but as it got closer towards the end of the day, the place began to fill up so there might be a wait.  Only negative, tables are a little small... But everything else was great! Enjoy.
Bea was great! Food was delicious and service was good. The ambiance was really nice and would be perfect for any occasion. Definitely visiting again soon! I ordered the Chicken and tomato mach with mushroom sauce, it was delicious. My friend ordered the shrimp toast which was also great!
Honestly, very disappointed. The dishes are lacking any vegetable assortment. Really just rice and meat with basil. Though we ordered four dishes, the sauces all tasted very similar. The meat was rather dry and the tofu was poorly cooked as well.  The presentation was simple, which was rather quaint and felt like a family kitchen. It wasn't bad, but there are better options in the area.
great food, great service, i usually order the shirmp with galic butter sauce. guys order the garlic bread and try dip it in the sauce, that was way too amazing. Best fries i ever have, the sauce goes with the fries is awsome. i always take my new friends here.  the biggest problem isisisisisisis THE LONG LINE. YOULL HAVE TO WAIT AROUND TWO HOURS AT WEEKEND. BUT WORTH IT!!
I went to OBAO for the first time this past weekend and it is definitely a solid place to go.  The first thing you notice when walking in is the gorgeous interior.  And then when you go upstairs to use the restroom you realize how the interior up there is even more gorgeous.  OBAO definitely has a great atmosphere that would make any dining occasion seem special. OBAO also has a lunch menu that is well-priced and is even available on the weekends.  It has so many options and was hard to choose.  I ended up going with the Pho Bo, my first time having Pho.  The lunch specials come with an appetizer, so I got the Grilled Japanese Eggplant.  The appetizers for the lunch special aren't very big, but it tasted great.  I am always happy to see eggplant on the menu!  The Pho was delicious, and was even better with a little bit of sriracha in it.  I am definitely looking forward to trying more pho in the future, and to trying more of OBAO's menu. The bottom line?  Spacious, gorgeous interior with tasty food, good prices, and an expansive menu!
Like so many other reviewers, my experience at Vinegar Hill House was that the food isn't good enough to make up for the horrible service. You can get much better food and much better service lots of other places - there's no need to be treated like an inconvenience at this one.
"I think this is one of the best ramen places I've tried. It's worth the trip out to Long Island.  My friend and I came on a rainy Tuesday and luckily there was no wait! It's a communal table, so you'll be sharing the table with several others. There's coat rack on the walls. I love the rustic urban decor of this place and the plants!  When I order the chicken wing gyoza, I was expecting a dumping, but it was a whole wing and it was stuffed with pate. Something I've never seen before. It came out fresh out of the fryer with Krispy skin. Underneath that layer of skin, was a nicely moist chicken wing. It's fairly big and the pate inside doesn't jump out at you, but it adds to flavor profile and gives it depth. I remember it was pretty expensive, but it's nice to try something new!  I think what makes this place spectacular is appetizers! My friend got the Miso Ramen and I got the Pork Ramen. The pork ""chasu"" was exceptional! It was smokey and pink, a lot like bacon! The texture of the meat was perfect! We're the type of people that finished the entire bowl or soup. No drops left behind!"
There is nothing new in my review that fellow Yelpers previously wrote about.  We ordered Roast pork noodle soup and a panfried noodle (not the Chinese American crispy kind) dish between the two of us. I wasn't too thrilled by the panfried dish, but the soups were pretty on point. Noodle bowls are mainly noodle, broth (seemed a deep flavor to me), some greens, with a tub of cilantro on the table if you'd like a garnish, and if you opt for a protein, you'll find that. This is pretty much what I expect from a fresh hand-pulled noodle joint, not much else. You go for the fresh, on the spot, handpulled noodles. If you find yourself down in this neck of the woods on a weeknight, prime-o seating and an empty restaurant is to be expected. Other brownie points: the cashier, who also took our order, spoke English: very helpful.  to sum it up: fresh noodles, good soup, not very expensive. Stop on by.
Disappointing because it got good ratings, likely inflated by tourists overwhelmed by the glitz of Manhattan. I was hoping for better food. The service was subpar, especially the person working in the front. We walked in and stood in front of her without a greeting. Finally I said hello and things started going. The prices here are too high for what they're actually serving. I realized that it's because they hiked up the $$ for the tourists who get dropped off on busses right in front of the venue to get to the hotel right next to it.
Overall I'd say it's preeeeeeety good. For the price a brunch entree and a drink is a good price. The beer lines taste incredibly dirty. There is a ton of diacytle (gives a buttery off-flavor) in the beer lines. Also the services is medium at best. If I came again I'd sit closer to the front, only have cocktails and ask for the check sooner rather than later
Burgers, fries, sandwiches, salad, taco all in one place.  Why not?  Got a little time when I was in the area.  Definitely too early for lunch since I usually eat around 1pm.  It's a very tiny dim lighting place.  I wanted to try everything but I was there alone and too early to eat.  I ordered three different kind of tacos.  Grilled steak, pork belly, and tempura fish.  They are like palm sized but pretty tasty, especially the fish taco.  I didn't expect the tempura fish is so light, warm, and crisp.  Salsa and pico tasted like house make.  I like the crunchy cabbage slaw on the fish taco.  Just good with the flavor and texture in one bit.  I definitely would go back and try a burger and cheese fries and of course more fish taco.
Bad service, bad manner. Their Tsing Dao beer is 3 times more expensive than the same product in the nearby westside supermarket. The drinks cannot be taken out. I will never come to this place again.
I have been mulling over my rating for a couple days because some of the things we got I LOVED and the things that I didn't totally love were mediocre at best.  Additionally, our service was not great -- I had to ask for sugar for my iced tea twice, we had to request bread that every other table got as soon as they were seated, we had to ask to have our waters refilled. Overall, the place is really cute with great ambiance.  Tables are super close together but it's what you would expect for an NYC restaurant of this level.  There are a couple outdoor tables but there was a longer wait for them so we sat inside (no wait around 6pm on a Saturday - not bad!) There were two of us and yes we ordered all of this and no there were no leftovers: -- Fritto misto - your standard fried food platter (calamari, rock shrimp, clams, zucchini), but in with all of that stuff they had some fried lemon slices!  Made it very different and memorable. -- Fried mozzarella with prosciutto and eggplant - decent, nothing to write home about. -- Grilled Atlantic salmon - my husband got this and had no complaints.  I didn't try it but his plate was clean (his plate always gets clean). -- Mushroom crusted virgin chicken - this was on the bone which I usually don't like, but the bone was small and the chicken was really tender and well-seasoned with the crust.  My only complaint was that the risotto that it was sitting on was room temperature and bland.  It really brought down what could've been a 5-star dish for me. -- Broccolini with roasted garlic - SO GOOD.  The broccolini was tender and the roasted garlic was sweet and spreadable and just perfect. -- Truffle mac and cheese tart - I don't understand what all the fuss is about this dish.  I think it just sounds good so people don't want to talk badly about it.  It came out lukewarm and was pretty bland.  I wish we didn't get it. Dessert: -- Warm flourless chocolate cake - really good but I wish the menu mentioned the fact that it had raspberry sauce.  I'm not a fan of fruit sauces on my chocolate and was unpleasantly surprised by that. -- White chocolate macadamia blondie sundae - really good but really hard to eat because the dish it is served in isn't big enough and the ice cream was just spilling out all over the place.  A bigger dish would've made all the difference. It kills me to give this place 3 stars because some of the food we got was truly 5-star quality, but I can't look past the couple of things we got that were disappointing.  Their service could use some improvement, too.
More like food truck middling food. Not impressed. The avocado in my Reina Pepiada was so hard and tasteless I skipped eating it to save the calories. Though the chicken was tasty. The arepitas fritas were hard. The dessert way too sweet
Sooo coming from LA where the food quality and quantity is a plenty I would have to say this place fell short in my book.  Cozy underground restaurant with an open modernish decor. When you first walk downstairs make sure you get your name on the wait list and go immediately to the right where the bar is located to wait. We had a few drinks while waiting one being the SAKURA- $10 pomegranate juice, lemon syrup, tequila, freshly squeezed lime and salted Sakura flower. Not a fav. The drink tasted weird, salty, sweet, and lemon-y all mixed together. We also had the MOSCOW MUWLE -$9 Jamaican style ginger beer, lemon juice and vodka. Basic Moscow mule nothing Spectacular,  I expected better 3 stars**** to eat we ordered  KIN CHI CREAM UDON $10.95 I wanted to try this so bad and had high hopes but the only thing that I liked was the noodles. It was cooked very well but the flavoring of this was ehhhh. 3 stars*** UMA SOBA $11.95 an omelette filled with soba noodles and veggies. Surprisingly Pretty good I enjoyed this one. 4 stars**** KARA AGE CHICKEN $7.95 Japanese style deep fried chicken. Decent portion of fried chicken seasoned pretty well, I'd eat this again. 4 stars*** TAKOYAKI KARA- $7.95 octopus balls deep fried with mayo, brown sauce and bonito flakes. Small but Pretty good, I've had better. 3 1/2 stars*** KUSHI YAKI- $13.95 Grilled assorted skewers of shishito peppers, pork belly, chicken breast, chicken thigh, and chicken meatball. Not too bad. Flavorful and cooked well. I like that they had an assortment so you can try all the yakatori options. 4 stars*** KALBI- $14.95 grilled short ribs. Decent flavor a bit fatty. 3 1/2 stars*** UNI SUSHI ROLL- $10.95 ok. Uni was lacking and you can barely taste it 3 stars*** SHRIMP TEMPURA ROLL$7.95 basic roll nothing special 3 stars*** Service was ok. We had to ask for water a few times before it was replenished.  Overall an ok experience. Nothing stuck out to me foodwise and service wise. Surprised by all the positive reviews, but then again I'm from LA where this type of food is a plenty. Doubt I'll be back
I went at the wrong time. Since it closes around 7p, I was planning to have an early dinner around 5p, mostly because it tends to be packed for lunch and there are not enough seats. I should have known that most dishes would only be warmed up for us. And so they were... not exactly what I had envisioned. Chorizo con castañas: not awful, but it tasted like it was prepared hours before (and it probably was). Morcilla con tomate: very tasty; still warmed up, but it surely had a more fresh feel. Pulpo a la gallega: it had very little flavor. I'm sure this place is great for lunch (if you can get a seat), but please don't make the same mistake we made... go as soon as the food is prepared, or it won't be that special.
Excellent experience. Seasonal tasting menu with wine pairing was delicious. Dining room is warm and comfortable.
The best Thai food I've had in the city! Highly recommend getting: -Thai iced tea -Thai iced coffee -Chicken satay skewers -Chicken curry puffs -Crab and pork dry noodles -Pad see ew -Pad Thai -Any of their desserts (coconut black sticky rice with pumpkin custard) It's a tiny place so be prepared to wait or just do take out. Everything was so delicious. I've been multiple times now and recently took a friend. She was blown away! A lot of Thai places similar to Chinese take out places are just mediocre at best. Places on the east side will do if I get any cravings, but this is seriously so delicious. I'll be coming here whenever I'm on the west side or catching a show or something. So happy I started eating here!
The moment I heard about the cheese taco shell, I knew I had to go try it for myself. This place definitely gets busy and the line can get long but it goes by really fast. The tacos were mouthwatering but the only downside is that there is no seating area. You will be seeing lots of people standing around enjoying their tacos. I ordered one steak and one chicken taco, each with the cheese taco shell but I would suggest getting one with the regular taco shell and one with the cheese taco shell because it was a bit overwhelming having so much cheese and oil. Nonetheless, this place is worth a try especially if you love cheese and/or tacos!
The wait would have been extremely long. Recommend going on open table and making reservation beforehand. Luckily we were able to find a seat in the bar area which was first come, first serve.  There was only one bathroom (maybe someone was taking way too long in the other one?). Waited at least 15 minutes in line to go to the bathroom. Came back to my high top table and food still didn't arrive yet. Pretty sure we waited at least 30 minutes just for our food to arrive. It was just so packed.  I will give super kudos to the host. He was greeting customers, cleaning up tables, kicking out people from the bathroom line that weren't dining there, checked the bathroom to see if it was clean, etc. He was doing so many things at once and still keeping his cool.  I ordered the salmon crostini and the soup of the say (mushroom bisque). Both were really good but I'm not sure if it was worth the wait to get the table, waiting for them to clean or table, and waiting for the food to get there. Idk, just seems they can't handle the rush of customers.
"I have been to Gallito's a few times and while the food is consistently good, the service today left a lot to be desired.   First, they were out of bread for tortas, which makes absolutley no sense.  How is a restaurant out of BREAD?!  Second, the food took about a million years to be served.  When we ordered our food we asked that we get the soups before our entrees. However, 30 minutes later we still did not have any soup (or entrees for that matter).  When i asked the waiter when the soups would be coming out he rudely replied that they would accompany our entrees.  When I said I didn't understand since we asked for them to come out first, he mocked me and retorted ""you don't understand?!"" He then came up with some excuse of how there is one guy working so that's the way it would have to be. He offered no apologies for the delay and walked away. Maybe this is me being sensitive, but this rudeness was appalling -- mocking a customer like that? What kind of service is this??? When we got our bill, I was surpirsed to see that they included an 18% gratituty on the check. Especially since we were only a group of 5 and not a large party.  So, not only was the service horrendus, but now I was forced to tip them 18%?!? Unacceptable."
In all my years living in Brooklyn, I have never tried L&B Spumoni Gardens. One August Saturday afternoon, I finally got the chance to. Short story - a bit over-hyped Long story - they only have outdoor seating available (at least for the summertime during lunch hours). You order your food, and bring it to a table, like any other pizzeria. I'm glad that we decided to call ahead for pick-up, and then eat it there, which is probably the best option (I ordered about 15 minutes ahead and it was still piping hot when we ate it). So I can't speak for how long a pie would take but if you want to buy individual slices, I'm pretty sure they crank them out pretty quickly. Now, I'm not normally a fan of Sicilian slices but when I do eat them, I prefer them on the doughier side, and L&B definitely delivers on this. But it was definitely only okay. I wasn't wowed by it. It didn't live up to my expectations and all the great things I've been hearing about L&B. The true winner was actually the spumoni. It's a mix of pistachio, chocolate, and almond (?). If I were to come back, it will be for the spumoni, not the pizza.
Came here on a Saturday with some friends for brunch. The line was extremely long, which we were prepared for, however they told us the wait was an hour and we were not seated till over an hour and a half later. We kept asking the hostess about when our table would be ready and she was very rude in her responses, at times just waving us off and walking away. It was frustrating and not the best way to start brunch.  The food did make up for the long wait a little bit but I've had better food at other brunch places in the area. I would definitely like to come back and give this place another shot though because I've heard great things about it.
We made reservations using Yelp and turned up at the restaurant to hear that they 'disconnected' from Yelp so our reservation did not exist. So frustrating at 8:30pm on a Saturday night! And no attempt made by the hostess to even try to accommodate us!
I thought my beet salad was very tasty. Not used to paying $16 for this portion if food, but hey, it's a kinda-swanky Italian joint in the financial district!
You want Malaysian cuisine, great service from a knowledgeable staff and ample seating, come here to Nyonya.... I've visited more than enough times to know you'll always head home satisfied with your food. having eaten the food firsthand you'll come to understand why on most evenings there will be crowds waiting to be seated. I'd rather wait for good food then be the only person in a restaurant with bad food.
Everything was fresh a delicious. Perfect for a warm day. Sit on the sidewalk for great people watching.
Soooo glad I got to try this place out as it was ranked #1 pizza in NY. We had a party of 7 and thought it was going to be a long wait as there was a long line but we were lucky a big table was just leaving. We got sat maybe after 10 minutes and the guy who was helping us was very kind. We ordered #1 (without the egg) and #6 (the one with guac). So far, it's my favorite place for pizza in New York. It didn't take long for the order to come out after we ordered and both pizzas were super delicious! For the #1 specialty pizza, the bacon was a bit too salty for me but it complimented #6 as that was on the less salty side. However, I still enjoyed #6 much more even though my friend described it as a quesadilla pizza. I think what really made me like the pizza here was their crust. I'm generally a thin crust girl so their crust on their entire pizza was amazing! It was just the right amount of crisp to where it was not a dusty texture and still warm and cheesy.  One day I'll be back to try their desserts because it looked really good but I was so full from eating throughout the day. I'm not sure how it's next to Grimaldi's and both restaurants had lines waiting to get some pizza but if I had to choose, it would definitely be Juliana's. Looking forward to trying their pizza with prosciutto on it as well.
Why have you only entered my life now? Best wonton noodles this side of the world! Springy and perfectly 'al dente' egg noodles.  They serve really delicious varieties of congee and soup noodles.  So happy that someone finally decided to combine simple Cantonese classic congee and soup noodles with shanghai xiao long bao.  Usually I would have to pick one or the other when I'm out at Chinatown but it's all here! The menu is extensive yet simple.  Perfectly thin-skinned delicious xiao long bao, cruellers for your congee, steamed shrimp rolls with peanut and hoisin sauce! All delish! Prices are slightly higher than the rest of Chinatown. Everything is probably $1 more but I prefer that for high quality.  I almost didn't want to post this review on Yelp because I really don't want to fight to get a table!
Love the breakfast menu but not when I'm told after 45 minutes of waiting that my dish is out and then served the wrong substitute dish not to mention that I had to wait exactly one hour for the coffee to be served since it wasn't ready when I placed my order. So I ran next store to the competition to buy a cup 45 minutes into waiting. This is the second time I've had this similar scenario happen here. Get it together Tito rads. When you open in the morning, your staff should be better prepped.
Ordered the Wild Spirit smoothie with strawberry, banana, and almond milk. I watched the staff member take the strawberries from the plastic container with the stems still attached and drop them into the blender. I asked him why he didn't remove the stems and he said the strawberries are pre-cleaned and that's how they make that smoothie. I've never seen anyone make a juice or smoothie with strawberry stems still attached before, but I took him at his word. After tasting the smoothie it's clear that he lied and should have removed the stems. My fruit smoothie tastes like leaves.
Called at 4.30 and the lady did not take my order. Asked me to go online and order. Online did not have all the items. Could hear her telling her colleague that she is leaving at 5 and cannot take a pickup order. Seriously? Always like the rolls though.
After having a bad experience at Heartland Brewery my coworker and I came here to grab lunch. We got the creamy udon which had no flavor and the chicken was super dry, the French fries which were super fried and didn't taste good and the medium soy garlic combo drum and wings but they brought out half soy and half spicy. We had to tell them we ordered all soy. The waiter brought the wings back in and a few minutes later our wings came out and a few pieces were still spicy and none of them were hot as in it didn't just come out of the fryer! The soy garlic wings were super sweet, OD sweet and the table next to us even said it as well.  What a bad lunch experience. I've been here for happy hour and the wings and fries were better last time. Too bad this place isn't consistent with the food. I'll probably only come back for happy hour but that's it.  Btw those staircases you have to take to the 2nd floor is so narrow and trippy and dark. I hope people don't leave drunk.
My recent trip to New York ended on a high note with brunch at Jane and their famous vanilla bean french toast!  I came here on a Monday right around lunchtime (I had a reservation for 11:45 I believe) and it was completely empty (see picture for proof!). I don't think I really needed a reservation, especially because I was on my own, but it never hurts to have it, plus you get OpenTable points! I asked my server what she recommended, and she mentioned that the french toast was their most popular item, so I went with that. I also got a side of scrambled eggs since I knew it was going to be so much sugar for me to eat by myself and I wanted something savory to balance out the sweetness. My french toast came very quickly (yay for being in a mostly empty restaurant!) and I was surprised by how big each piece was. I eyed it with some skepticism as I didn't think I could finish it all three slices, but as soon as I took my first bite, all my reservations flew away and I happily inhaled everything until there were only crumbs left on my plate. It was SO good. I felt like I was eating a crossover of custard and cake instead of french toast. It was still warm from the grill and each bite was so soft that it practically melted in my mouth. Words cannot do this french toast justice!! This ties with the french toast at Nopa (in SF) as my favorite french toast of all time. The scrambled eggs were also done just right. They were soft and fluffy and not overcooked which is what I see at most restaurants. I wish I had come with more people so we could all order different things and share. As much as I loved the french toast, by the 3rd slice all the sugar was getting to me and I definitely slowed down a bit. I paid $28 for my meal after tax and tip.
The cheese plate was ok but it did introduce me to a new phenomenon- cheese dipped in honey! Where the heck have i been?! Such a great marriage. There was also a standout cheese in the bunch... a super-mild blue? Tasted of creamy pollyO with the faintest hint of blue cheese... not offensive at all... but then again ur tastes buds change every 13 years so a lot of things that I used to abhor, I find interesting and good now. The avocado cucumber mesclun salad was light and refreshing. The lasagna was homey, perfectly soft and crusty around the edges.... it's saucy bolognese sauce was mopped up with an accompaniment of table bread that was otherwise bland by itself. I have a feeling there is much more goodness to barbalu- we were just not hungry. The ambience was perfect and quiet on a Monday evening... great for first, second and fifth dates- or if u have a lot to say to one another... because it's tranquil, darkened and pretty to look at.
This place is cute. The menu is hit or miss. Avoid the French fries which are over cooked and hard. Gnocchi lacks seasoning. The pork belly risotto however is amazing, as is the smoked salmon angel hair pasta. The grilled peach salad was wonderful as well. Of the 6 entrees we ordered 3 were passable to delicious,  and 3 were lacking in one way or another. Given that NYC has so many amazing places to eat, I wouldn't return to this one except maybe for drinks at the bar.
This was our first meal when we arrived to NYC and we were starving and wanted a quick lunch after the flight and airport stuff. This is such a well reviewed place so we thought we would give it a try. Overall, it was tasty but I wouldn't come here again. I felt like the lobster roll portion was on the smaller side than I'm used to and for $30 for a roll it should be a little bigger or at least more lobster to bread ratio. Maybe we just caught them at an off day. The server was very nice so they get a point for that. It also came with fries which was nice as well but I can't say that it blew me away. It was good but not amazing. Maybe I should have went for the burger here as the lobster part was just alright. If you do work near the area and want to check it out, it's definitely an option for a quick and easy lunch but I wouldn't go out of my way to experience this place as it's just okay.
Overall I liked Calle Ocho, I came here on a date and it definitely is a cozy atmosphere with an upscale lounge feel to it.  The food and drinks were a mixed bag. The Gallitos were the appetizer we got and easily the best thing we had. I got the Pollo Peruano which looked amazing as far as presentation but was only decent in taste. My date got the Vaca frita al Caballo which she said was ok. As far as drinks I usually love caipirinhas but this one was a let down. The sangria was better though. The service was exemplary as staff was attentive but not overbearing. I would give the service as well as the overall environment a 5 with a nice vibe and ambiance. The food I would give a 3 and you can get better bang for your buck as far as eating goes (Gallitos being the exception) but I would come back again.
I lived in SAn Diego for 11 years, so this review comes from a place of knowing something about Mexican food and street tacos.  Order the Al Pastor tacos, life changing taste. That is all.
A Friend recommended this place to me. Long story short.  Pro's  Nice little place . Sake was good.  Music was ok. Tacos were good  Con's Service not so good. Very slow.  Small portions.  Chef yells a lot at her employee. In front of us.  I seen some of the food I ordered go from the fridge to the microwave. NOT Cool Prices are to high for microwave.    The owner/chef needs to work on a better system.  if you are having a bad day you don't have to take it out on your employee. Get a therapist for that anger.  Will not be coming back.
"Grimaldi's under the Brooklyn Bridge is a New York institution.  This is where I take my guests when they come to visit New York.  Now, if what you want is the original Grimaldi's, then you should come here.  Why?  The original Grimaldi's was sold off to the current owner of Grimaldi's and the original person who opened up the historic Grimaldi's is actually next door now at Juliana's Pizza. I take my guests here because the pizza is essentially the same at both places and they all know the Grimaldi name.  Some of my guests have done their research and know about Juliana's, so for those guests, I take them to Juliana.  Everyone else is happy to go to Grimaldi's. As long as you come here realizing it's a tourist spot, you'll have a good time.  It's a place for tourists, but it is not a tourist trap.  They actually make very good food here.  Don't be intimidated by the line since it moves quickly and is part of the experience. The pizza itself is wonderful.  Nice thin crust with a bouncy cornicione on the edge.  The tomato sauce is nicely fresh tasting and acidic.  They use good sliced mozzarella.  And the pepperoni is made with natural casing so it ""cups"" up and the edges burn a bit in the oven.  The ""cupping"" of sliced pepperoni is a sign of good quality pepperoni.  I would suggest you either stick with the plain cheese pie or add pepperoni.  Or add one ingredient of your choice.  These pizzas don't hold up to adding too many ingredients on top. Surprisingly, the thing my guests tend to enjoy the most is the spumoni gelato truffle.  I have no idea how they cut this thing so thin so cleanly and I have no idea how they make these so delicious.  It's a perfect ending to the meal and should not be missed. Is this where I would go if I'm craving pizza?  No.  But this is where I would go if you have guests in town and want to show them a good time."
This restaurant has an open,  airy ambience. We were warmly greeted by friendly servers and service was attentive. The food was well prepared with very eye appealing presentation. The breakfast items including Mediterranean Breakfast and Madame Freda were wonderful. The Tuna Salad was nice. The dressing of the Greek kale salad a bit too tart for my taste, even after the hostess graciously redid it with dressing on the side. Wish I had ordered the breakfast instead of trying to eat more heathy greens. Still we had a very nice visit.
Crabs away! Be forewarned that you have to wait an hour or more. That said, we chose to check out Le Sel which is nearby and then headed back to have the crabs. They text you when the table is ready, we were 15-20 minutes before the time we were given (had less wait than expected) It is a very small space. There seemed to be a lot of large groups. At first I was surprised that everyone was eating with blue surgical gloves on. My husband and I decided to eat with our bare hands- as we think it is weird and somewhat yucky to eat with plastic gloves on.  That said, once we started eating our dungeoneus crab, I understood why people would want the gloves - it was very saucy and had amazing flavor. I don't know how they do it exactly but the crab is boiled in the sauce (how it got its name). Let's put it this way- best crab I've ever had except for that one time in San Francisco.  My only problem with The Boil is how much plastic was used to cook, serve and consume the meal. I think it would so much better if consuming the food didn't create so much plastic trash that goes back into the ocean and kills the fish (and crabs). Also, when the plastic bags are boiled in the water, it releases cancer causing toxins. Will I go back? Absolutely, not too often though as it will definitely increase my carbon footprint.
It was delicious. Great spot for group and also for kids. Get the burger & lobster combo. Cheese and bacon on the burger, garlic in your butter. Stay away from the burger and lobster roll appetizers. LOL!
Stumbled upon this place and so glad we did ! Root and Bone is a rustic homey feeling spot. They nailed the Mac n cheese , fried chicken and shrimp and grits recipes. Service is good and the food doesn't disappoint!
Came here for brunch with our friends and loved it so much that we ended up staying until the dinner menu came out. Must say the service here is amazing! Jonathan and his staff were extremely attentive to my friends and family and even my one year old son! Most places welcome kids but don't really welcome them if you know what I mean, but here the staff was super friendly with Christopher that they even called him by his name and not baby! 5 stars for that. They also brought him water in his own cup with me asking for it and our waiter was so sweet with him as well. They definitely have a lifetime customer with us! I had the pineapple mojito which I've never tried before and it was great! The brunch menu was great as well. Definitely a place to go, they'll see me here again.
When I saw that they had four stars my wife and I decided to try it for early dinner. My wife ordered the Thanksgiving dinner sandwich, looked great on the menu. My wife said they made a mistake and gave me ham instead of turkey. She told the waitress who then brought it back to show the chef, at our request. The waitress  brought it back to the table and told us they get their turkey sliced from the deli, they don't have ham. It was probably sliced smoked turkey from the local deli. We got the impression that a thanksgiving dinner sandwich would be made with fresh turkey breast. My wife also ordered a glass of cava ($15) that was flat and came in a tiny 1950s champagne glass.  If you want to try a real Irish pub with good pub food go about five blocks uptown to Genesis, it's not gourmet but the it is good and you might on occasion hear a little Irish spoken there.
The stars for Amelie are well deserved! We arrived a bit earlier than our reservation and still were able to sit AND enjoy the Happy Hour pricing! We started off with 2 wine flights of red variations, which were delicious. We also got the Pistachio Crusted Goat Cheese which was accompanied with warm honey and onions. As a 99% of the time dairy free person, this was delectable. The starting bread and crostini were also really good. For my main, I got the Octopus Carpaccio app - definitely filling enough. My boyfriend got the Steak Frites. I did have some of his fries. I thought they would be eh because they were skinny, but OMG they were perfect and salty. He also got one meat choice for $7, which he was happy with. The mustard and pickles I ate on the plate with that were so good!! Overall amazing experience and really not that pricy for what we received. The decor here was great and so was the staff. Tight tables, but not uncomfortable in the slightest. Cool idea that the check was served in a book. Will definitely return!
The Chicken & Red Velevet waffle was good, not amazing, still delicious though. Side of home fries was good too.  Drinks are good, a peach infused punch  (I think the Mardi Gras special) was really good, very cinnamon like after taste.  For dessert. had some of the Smore's cake and it was amazing! The cake, the ice cream and the whipped cream side was great. Love it! (It was a birthday dessert for a friend, I had half to share and help finish) The waitress we had wasn't amazing, but she did her job. Would come again, hopefully have a more attentive and bubbly server.
This place is nice if you're craving cheesecake. It's not the best and in my opinion the cream cheese taste was a little too strong. Wouldn't go back.
Food: 3.5/5.0 Service: 4.0/5.0 Value: 3.5/5.0 Decor: 3.0/5.0 Overall: 3.5/5.0  Good happy hour deal (6 oysters + 1 beer = $12) and decent grub but I wished the menu were a little more extensive. The uni appetizer was excellent and definitely worth getting.  The clam fettuccine was good (clams were great, fettuccine was okay).  I think a little overrated at 4.5* as of August 2016 but still worth trying.
Beautiful place and busy as can be.   Food seemed inspired and drinks were well made.   The chefs seems young but confident and people were frequently turned away.   I walked in and asked for an opening.   45 minutes or bar were the options, so I opted for bar.   Pasta was great and  would go back for more.   Unfortunately they seemed rather busy and politely unaccommodating.   I witness some patrons getting air kisses while others just told no seating ready and at least two groups told the outdoor tables (which were empty) were closed by 9 pm so they could not eat there. Had to wait quite some time for the food and though a table opened up in the dining area, none of the bar patrons were offered to move over.    Perhaps it was just busy but it felt a little like they knew they were one of the only games in town.  Great food but could be friendlier in how they treat their guests.
The appetizers were good. The roasted cauliflower was a little too bland for my liking, but that could just be me.  The worst thing of the night was the $25 salmon which was cooked only on the crust and raw inside. We sent back the salmon and got back the same piece on a different plate and STILL uncooked. When we asked the waiter he was quick to say we ordered rare, which I'm sure we did not. serving uncooked food is one thing, but denying wrong doing is another. Never going back.
"I totally forgot I had eaten here five years ago until I stepped foot inside and recognized the small narrow interior, where I previously scarfed down half a rectangular pie before a punk-rock concert (disclaimer: I don't listen to punk rock and spent most of that night wishing I was still eating pizza). Adrienne's is more or less an institution if you work anywhere near Wall Street and Stone Street is your post-work watering hole. An added bonus for closing around midnight.  They start you off with complimentary bread rolls and oil/vinegar. Some would say that bread right before pizza is way too many carbs. I say that the house bread is much, much better than your average free bread and you should add some red pepper flakes into the oil for some added oomph.  Suffice to say that you can't go wrong with any one of the ""old-fashioned"" or grandma style pizzas. I like to keep mine simple with just pepperoni and maybe some mushrooms and green peppers. I tried the round margherita once but I like the grandma pies more by virtue of the added crust acreage if you grab one of the corner slices.  The pizza also tastes just as good, if not better, eaten cold.  Once, my friend and I went rogue and did not order pizzas, instead opting for pastas. It shouldn't be possible that the pastas are even better than the pizzas but they really are. My recommendations: potato gnocchi in spicy marinara (the taste does get a little one-note after awhile so I suggest splitting), shrimp penne in vodka sauce, and the stuffed shells! A word of caution: you will not feel like moving very quickly after eating one of these dishes in one sitting. Indeed, after eating the shrimp penne, I had to speak slower and steer clear of sudden movements. It felt like all the energy in my body was directed to the task of digestion. Caesar salad was meh. We got it because I was a killjoy and wanted greens. The neighboring table's mushroom salad looked better.  Two overlooked items in the antipasto section of the menu: the stuffed olives and asparagus with prosciutto. They're well worth the stomach space.  I will say that the pizza and pasta were pricier than other places in the city (including my perennial favorite, Motorino). Service was harried and slammed but we didn't have to wait too long to bury our faces in pizza and that's honestly all that matters."
Fabulous dinner. Chicken Parma was very good.  teramasu and the canolia was excellent. SERVICE Was very good. Loved it
I came here for dinner on a Saturday night.  Prepare for a long wait since it's super crowded here after work or weekends.  They will give you a number and call it out frequently just to make sure you're still around.  We waited almost 45 minutes for a table.  When you're seated, make sure to order xiaolongbao (soup dumplings) as soon as possible since it does take some time to make.  I do like their crab/pork and pork soup dumplings since they're big, have a lot of meat/soup in each one, and the soup is very tasty.  Everything else is not very memorable - ordered the flounder, braised string beans, pan fried noodles, pork chops, and scallion pancakes.  I feel like I could better Chinese food elsewhere but the soup dumplings are pretty good.  However, I don't know if they're worth the long wait though.
So I knew I had to have New York-style pizza at least once during my NYC trip and my friend suggested/bookmarked this place for quite some time so we decided to check it out. It was convenient for us because it was in DUMBO area and we just finished having our photoshoot there so why not enjoy some authentic Brooklyn/New York-style pizza? :) There wasn't a huge line when we came so I was pleased that we only had to wait about 15ish minutes. As you may have heard, Juliana's used to be the original Grimaldi's but moved next door to this location and changed their name to Juliana's. I was surprised to see two pizza places right next to each other competing for customers haha. I was honestly really excited to try New York-style pizza for the first time, especially after trying Chicago deep dish pizza several years back. When we went inside, we decided to order a large size of the Number 1 Pizza Special which comes with: mozzarella, scamorza affumicata, pancetta* (Italian bacon), scallions and Oregon-grown white truffles in olive oil--no tomato and some Arugula salad. Since it's a special, you can't order half of this and half of another pizza combo. As soon as I had my first bite...like omegawd...it was so effin delicious!!!  It was served fresh and hot and I now know why New York-style pizza is so famous/popular and monumental to every New Yorker haha. I really enjoyed how thin the thin crust was and there was a lot of flavor in the Number 1 special. Salad was nice and light. Service was great as well!  The reason I gave 4 starts instead of 5 was because for me, I get really bad heartburn easily and after having 3 large slices of pizza, my stomach didn't feel too well. I kinda expected it because pizza is one of the few meals that actually gives me really bad heartburn but hey, it was so worth. I would say that the pizza was also a bit salty because of the Italian bacon scattered on top of it but I definitely enjoyed my experience at Juliana's :)
Order Delivery from this place based on the positive reviews.  I order the curry and thailicious spare ribs.  The curry had a very plastic taste, maybe it had to do with the plastic bowl it was delivered in. The spare ribs portion was very small and mostly consist of fat and bones. I did like the Thai ice tea.
Hands down my favorite restaurant in NYC. I've been around 8 times and I can't get enough. The ambiance is beautiful. It's a perfect date spot but also a great place to go for a private party (you can rent out the wine cellar room upstairs). The service is top notch and all the waiters are so knowledgeable and nice!  Now onto the food... Holy sh*t: Roasted mushrooms  Fluke crudo  Cavatelli  Bucatini  Garganelli with ricotta salata and mushrooms Hanger steak Olive oil cake  I highly recommend everything I just listed. You really can't go wrong and pair it with a delicious glass of wine.  L'Artusi, I love you.
Came here tonight with my girls and overall had an OK experience. I feel like the only good thing about this place is the happy hour at the bar and the ambiance. The interior is cute and chill, great space to chat and hang with friends. The service though was sort of slacking, the staff weren't as attentive as I would like.  As for the food I tried the Magic Mushrooms (Big mushrooms with stuffing) and the Vongole (spaghetti with clams). My friend ordered the mushrooms at the bar during happy hour ($7) which was a great deal, if it's off the menu it's like $15(?) I don't quite remember but it was almost double. I actually really liked the mushrooms a lot. As for the pasta...$20..for LITERALLY a fist of pasta and like 6 small clams..probably one of the smallest pasta dishes I've had for the price. The dish itself was in between okay and good..but definitely not worth $20 especially for the portion and not being outstanding.  Overall was not impressed, not worth my money, yes the ambiance is nice, but that isn't my main or rather my only focus. I think the only time I would come back again is for the happy hour Monday - Friday 4-7PM on a selection of wines/hard liquor/beer and snacks. That's what I recommend checking out.
Waiting  2hours for a table ,you would think that the food was amazing,I had mimosa with chicken and waffle ,i asked for white meat,i got dark meat,either the chef dont know the difference btw white and dark or they just think people are just stupid..its not worth it..the mimosa was garbage idk what type of orange juice is clear..
This review is for the place in general because I went for a late snack and drink and can't review burger or the really elaborated sundaes ice creams I saw here and there. I can only say those desserts looked goooood! We had a beer, some nice onion rings and some chips with guac.  The onion rings came with a delicious truffle mayo. The guac lacked big time of just a marginal ingredient: avocadoooo! Prices are ok, you're in Soho after all. The place, the music, the bartender are all really cool
"Delicious authentic BBQ, but portions can be on the smaller side. Come earlier in the day as they can run out of their more popular items like burnt ends. Where they really shine is in the meat itself. Sides and appetizers are okay. Wish the portions were bigger though. We tried: _________________________ the ""Monster"" 50/50 ($14.99) A brisket and pulled pork sandwich with spicy habenero sauce. Coleslaw and pickles on the side. Pretty good. Not necessarily a ""Monster"" sized sandwich. Average sizes half baked mac & cheese ($11.99) decent, not super creamy and rich per say. The actual portion is maybe like a 6-8inch skillet.  Chili cheese fries ($11.99) Big portions, and you definitely get that meaty chili sauce on the fries. This was good. Order this one. Grilled Sausage a la carte ($6.49) Two sausages. Wish there was more. But they were spicy and delicious. Corn bread and honey butter ($3.99) T'was Aite Pork Belly ($5.99) Fatty and delicious. ________________________ We had a party of 4. 4 entrees and two appetizers came out to about $25 per person. Our waitress Christine was GREAT. Service I would put 5 stars, and well above normal. She was so accommodating, allowed us to swipe two cards, was always refilling waters and asking how we were coming along.  TLDR: come to just eat meat."
Not sure if to go for Viet, Thai or Malay food? This place has all 3 types of cuisine in one menu! Food was pretty good. Portions were decent and prices are affordable. I wish I could give this place a 5star but it was too crowded and there was barely any space in between each table and chairs.  Tip: Check-in on Yelp for a free thai iced tea!
Great service, but food was 2/10 at best. I should've gone to Taco Bell instead. The food was way overpriced. My husband ordered a chicken burrito for $25, I ordered 2 crunchy shredded beef tacos, I don't remember how much it was, but it was one of the worst beef tacos I've had. We each had a margarita, and our bill came out to about $100. I won't be coming back here or recommending this place to family & friends.
I've order seabreeze many times since they opened. But these past two times(within a two 2 week span), I've ordered the whiting combo. Both times my fish was overly done. Extremely hard and very chewy. I'm completely turned off by this. Poor customer service, handle by young men who don't have any etiquette. I'm just over it. I will not be ordering from here again.
I didn't want to have to explain pho to hapless New Yorkers. I thought that's what Jimmy Tu and Bun-ker were supposed to be doing, but this is not pho, hipster or otherwise.  Let me break down the beef pho: Noodles 1/10 - these weren't even pho noodles (too wide and thick). I'm pretty sure I could tell you exactly which package of noodles these are at the supermarket and then cook them better myself. Biggest WTF of the meal. Broth 5/10 - possibly a 4, incredibly bland and one-note - did this also come from the grocery store? Meat 8/10 - so buttery and tender, so delicious, was this even the same bowl? YUM Accoutrements 10/10 - all fresh, all accounted for  As for the rest of the menu, we also tried the pancake and the bun (pork vermicelli). The pancake was an absolute waste. A $13 app should not require assembly instructions. It consisted of repurposed spring roll ingredients plus a heap of bean sprouts, all in a lesser format. The bun was passable - again, the meats were stand-out, but it was served in the tiniest bowl, a thimble really, and the pork belly was refrigerator-cold.   The (new) space is hip and fun and temporarily BYOB but not worth the trek or the price tag. You're better off in Chinatown (New Tu Do, perhaps) with a more satisfying and less expensive bowl.
Stopped in here for lunch on a Sunday, frustrated by how many places we're closed.  It's times like this I missed the east village.  Anyways this place was okay.  Had the roasted chicken, ceviche, and some roasted veggies.  The ceviche was the standout dish, and the other stuff was okay.  A little pricey for what it was though.
It is conveniently located and any means of transport can take you there!  The place is neat and clean. A variety of choice to grab when feeling peckish. I chose the polish dumplings place Pierogi Boys because first I never had polish dumplings before and second the place looked authentic  when a bunch of people are working very hard in the open kitchen: one guy washing up the equipments and I mean he was seriously washing everything clean! Two ladies wrapping the dumplings and one also cooking them in batches at the same time. One guy serving the orders. One lady at he cashier. I like this kind of team work and having everyone a designated job in the line of production. Anyhow back to the food. All in all, worth a try. Good stuff though by the time I had the fourth piece down I was already feeling full !!
Roberta's is the perfect example of the fact that great food trumps all other needless amenities in a restaurant. The corn dish with Macadamia and some sort of limey seaweed herb butter(Just guessing) is the best dish I've ever had at a restaurant. Everything was spot on from taste to presentation with all the dishes we had. Any wait you have to endure to get in is worth it. We went on a Friday night and got a table in 15 mins.
I loved everything about this restaurant and I couldn't believe it's in the heart of the theater district. I was bracing for something not so good and we were pleasantly overjoyed with the entire experience. The servers were friendly, knowledgeable and pleasant. The menu offered a wide selection of choices for saldas, entrees and deserts. We enjoyed delicious wine and the tricolor salad. The moscata was sweet and chilled.   I had a deliciously prepared meat lasagna with sausage and ground meats with a pungent tomato sauce and Kay enjoyed a pasta Primavera with a mound of perfectly sautéed vegetables with bowtie pasta. Her food was bathed in olive oil and garlic.  We also enjoyed the espressos and the chocolate and vanilla gelato for dessert. I would definitely return and now I need to buy tickets for every show in the area so I can enjoy more and more meals at this lovely Italian restaurant.
I like to randomly stop into places while roaming the city. This place happened to be my Sunday night pop in.  Dim lit atmosphere, old world art on the walls. Nice brick walls, charming restroom.  OK NOW THE FOOD: the empanadas tasted authentic and were fairly good. The entree i tried was the arroz con pollo cruillo, not terrible but not a fan of it. The desert i had was the torrejas...now that was AWESOME esp. when paired with their cortadito (cuban coffee...might have spelled that wrong lol).  The staff was amazingly polite. May come back for the empanadas and desert. Of course ill try another entree next time!
Having waited to try X'ian it was hard to not choose to eat there one night to share a portion with my cousin. Having read a couple of the reviews about the 'doughy' noodles, slow service, lack of seating, their 'wrong recommendation to not take out the food is reasonable. 1) I don't have any knowledge about what the perfect noodle's texture or what the noodles were like before. But I have to say it was different both good and bad. I was sharing noodles N9 I believe. So it was hard to cut up the noodles and share, but the texture was different from any other noodle I've had before and I loved it. The sauce was great and flavorful. 2) Slow service. They just opened and having worked as a cashier who took both orders and called numbers out; I totally felt the cashier's pain because the line just would not stop. She was patient and great. 3) lack of seating. While most people usually took their food, what do you expect it's New York City and the space is small people! For us we had no trouble getting seats... Plus they recommend you stay to eat your first time so we did! It's obvious all these people had it before. 4) I guess I addressed the taking out part.. If you have the time stay and eat it's better to relax and eat than always being on the go!  Overall I'd come back! Hopefully to try the Lamb and  I'll update you until then!
"Ok, so we went here for ""brunch"" at 2 in the afternoon and were VERY disappointed. The good news is that the meal was very good and they included the tip in the price of the dish. The bad news was that the portions were very small, the prices were very high, and they included the tip in the price of the dish. Yes, the latter reads correctly. Our service was sub-par to say the least and we could not take it out of the tip to show our displeasure. We had to ask 3 times for ""refills"" of our iced teas. Only to find out that they charged us almost $5 apiece for each of the glasses of tea for what the waiter termed a ""refill"". I'm sorry, but a ""refill"" is FREE. Also, they would not bring bread to the table. The waiter told us they were saving it for the people who ordered pasta. Huh??? Leave this place to the tourists."
Must have chicken and waffles! Crunchy skin and juicy chicken. They were a little on the small size but that's what you get for quality right? The waffles came with different flavor butters- lemon, berry, rosemary and regular. My favorite was the lemon! It was like eating sweet and salty together. The perfect combo.  The place was nicely decorated but the music was a bit tooo loud. I could barely hear my friends who were right next to me. Other than that.. I would definitely come back!
"Straddles a line between good and very good - I believe it all depends on what you order. Beautiful white tablecloth restaurant with remarkable service. Incredibly expansive menu with an even more incredibly expansive wine list. I wonder if the large menu contributes toward a trap in execution - some items being ""signature"" and amazing, while others are just ""alright"".   Would like to return and give another go - and if I could do it all again I may spring for one of the tasting menus (probably the pasta one), as I believe that's where the signature Mario Batali shines through.  Great spot for an intimate dinner or small group. Service is wonderful."
I loved this tiny noodle shop! On a recent trip to NYC, I drug my family through the winding streets of China town to find Tasty Hand Pulled Noodle Shop that has been bookmarked for the last 2 years.  The shop is tiny and cramped. However, the noodles were exquisite. We tried a variety of noodles. Hand pulled in broth, knife cut stir fried, hand pulled lo mein, and to round it out some pork dumplings.  We've been back twice and enjoyed sitting in the patio tables on the closed off street. It's definitely a favorite spot to visit when we are in NYC!
This is my first and last time ordering from here. I placed an order at noon with the understanding that the lunchtime rush may delay things a bit. My food was expected to arrive by 1. It is now nearly 3 pm and my food arrived. I tried calling numerous times to get an update and the final 2 calls were to cancel my order, however, the phone number did not work.  When the food finally arrived, it was cold, refrigerator cold. Despite my hunger, I refuse to eat this cold food. I requested a refund, but who knows if I will even get a response. I will not be ordering from this place again.
This place is amazing. True true homemade Chinese noodles and dumplings... Noodles are pulled and dumplings are wrapped in front of your eyes - doesn't get much better than that.  Walk in and try to find an open stool, and in the meantime give your order to one of the ladies that come to the front. Add some hot chili oil (YUM) to your steaming bowl of fresh noodles and slurp slurp away!!  There is nothing so comforting as a hot bowl of noodles so enjoy!!! :)
There are two great food memories I have while traveling to New York. One of them being: CORN!!! We got the cuban sandwich and a side order of corn. The cuban sandwich was okay... But OMG just get the corn!!! Get like three orders of the corn for a meal you won't regret it!!! The corn is grilled and buttery and rolled in cojita with i think paprika. It's just amazing, get the CORN!!! That is all :)
"Not worth it, we got there around 9pm on Sunday... Was told the wait time would be 30 mins, and turned out they gave the table to another guy ""Andres"" who's after me, when I asked why I was skipped, the waitresses didn't even blink and still lied about the fact she did it on purpose. No wonder every time people had to wait for 2 hours here.  Save yourself and go somewhere else"
I love poke in general and was excited that I found this place that wasn't far from my office and got great reviews so I could go for lunch. I liked the feel inside and the concept of filling out the erasable sheets to place your order. Those were unfortunately about the only things I liked about Red Poke.  Maybe it was just what I ordered, but I was really disappointed. I made my own combination with tuna and salmon (large size) and added a few things like avocado. The tuna and salmon both did not taste fresh at all and the flavors really didn't work (which could have been my fault for the combination). I actually felt kind of sick all day afterwords. For $17, I think I definitely would have expected it to be better. I don't think I'll be back.
So much amaZingness going on at this place. Crawfish - GREAT  lobster - inevitably GREAT  PLEASE GET THE BRUSSEL SPROUTS. Honestly, they were delicious. And they paired very well with the seafood !  The reason I give 4 stars were two fold: 1. The shrimp was not the best. They didn't taste fresh. So perhaps I would go for crab the next time around.  2. The location is not as nice as the location near NYU.   Either way, I will definitely come back !!!
My friend and I wanted to eat hand pulled noodles so we found this on Yelp. It's located in an dark alley with limited seating. They have about five tables so it's not a great idea to bring a big group. The noodles are really good and cheap. Definitely stop by here for some cheap food that will fill you up.
One of my favorite pizza places in New York! Roberta's never fails to put out great food and a great vibe. My wife and I usually sit at the bar, which is first come first serve to avoid the long waits and it's good despite possibly being a little crowded. But hey, your next drink is just a quick pour away.  This time we tried their new Green Tomato salad, which was one of the best things we've ever put in our mouth. Thinly sliced green tomato, with creamy avocado, chunks of tomato underneath and a bright salsa verde make this dish a winner. Don't even hesitate, just order it! As far as pizza goes you can't really go wrong. Bee Sting and Speckenwolf are faves, but we just tried the Four Emperors and that is something special. Four cheese pizza with spicy arrabiatta sauce and sesame seeds. Mind and taste buds blown. It's probably my new favorite but seriously they're all good. I keep swearing that I'll try their pastas one day because they always look amazing but it's the pizza (and now the green tomato salad) that keeps us coming back.
One word - amazing!! Was doing the hop on hop off bus tour and got off just before Times Square and yelped lunch nearby tanner smith came up first and I so agree with the great reviews. The food was amazing and service great. I had the steak sandwich and cheese gravy fries. Highly recommend
And why is it so hard to get a table here....??? I  have had dinner in a lot of restaurants in the city,  I know that hospitality isn't the best feature of restaurants even though it should be but this place comes number 1 for most impersonal experience ever. Also train you servers not to have attitudes or get a job that makes you happy... Bad service, poor food quality, nothing memorable...
Update -- Manager is very nice. He saw review before we left, and came and apologized.  Said dinner is much better, different menu.  Maybe so.  Hopefully an improvement on lunch can happen. An example of star inflation IMHO.  Stopped for a quick lunch, and we're not understanding how this place gets 4.5 stars in NYC when we found it average in every way (except prices which are on the higher side).  Menu - unimaginative standard fare.  Wine - Good basics by the glass ($8 per glass fare at price of $14), didn't explore beyond that.  Soup - meh.  Salad - even less than meh (the house salad was a pile of limp lettuce with only: shredded carrots, grape tomatoes, too much bottled Italian dressing).  Bread - decent.  Olive oil presented with bread - very disappointing for a so called Italian restaurant, not good!, bitter and cheap tasting.  Atmosphere - comfortable, but could do without the constant, bad monotonous Euro beat pop music. Will continue the hunt for something better and with real taste in this nabe.  Definitely, there are better choices in other nabes of Manhattan and Brooklyn.
Burger and Lobster is a great restaurant! I had the Flirty Flatiron with vodka and it was phenomenal! Melon and lemonade flavors! My brother got a glass of red wine which was chilled, which I was annoyed with (we prefer our red wine room temperature and our white wine chilled). Our waiter was very nice and our service was on par. I ordered the original lobster roll and it was fantastic! The fries and salad were also delicious! The fact this place only serves lobsters and burgers is genius! Also the music playing in the restaurant was an awesome mix of 2000s hits!! Definitely coming back!
Got the dan dan noodles, which were supposed to be a specialty. Very poor. Won't be returning.
I have nothing good to say about this place. Waited an hour plus for food. Service was horrible. Food was mediocre at best. We were seated outdoors and later had a table placed millimeters away so that we could not get out of our own table without moving it against the wall... Not even a good atmosphere. Would never return and would never advise anyone to.
8:30 reservation on a wednesday - the restaurant was still packed. Ordered the seafood salad, and the foie gras appetizers. I enjoyed both very very much. If you're only going to stick with one appetizer, get the foie gras for sure! The outside was seared to perfection and the fattiness of the foie gras was married with a crunchy peanut sauce with a berry jam. If i base my review just off the appetizers, i would give it a 4.5. Unfortunately, my entree was a disappointment. Ordered the lamb and steak + drinks. Not a fan of lamb but it was cooked and seasoned well. I originally ordered the steak medium-rare. The steak came out totally medium-well...no red on the inside and it was tough to cut. Waiter suggested that i cut the middle of the steak... steak was grey and not an ounce of red. I immediately sent it back. THIS IS NOT A MISTAKE THAT A MICHELIN STARRED RESTAURANT SHOULD BE MAKING!!!! This was the first time i had ever sent food back to the kitchen. My replacement came out within 5-7 minutes. Waiter apologized. At this caliber of a restaurant, i expected at least a scoop of ice cream or small dessert...for a mistake that i expect from my local Applebee's.. not a michelin starred restaurant. Yes, our expectations should be higher for restaurants of this caliber.  Was foodless for a bit while mine was being cooked...boyfriend kept offering me his food because he felt awkward eating by himself. The steak does have a charred taste to it.. if youre not a fan of that taste, this steak is not for you. I thought the meat was tough...maybe ate about half the steak...offered some to my boyfriend and he ate some and gave it back to me... and he is a STEAK LOVER. There are other things on the menu that are probably 10x better. Waiter suggested the miso cod... now i totally regret not ordering that instead of the steak. Wah :( We were at the restaurant until about 10:30. I dont know where our waiter went... but we had to ask another waitress for our bill... our original waiter never came back to ask us how everything was before we left. sad because my bf spent good $$$$ at this restaurant and it did not meet our expectations. :(
Trying to find some place open till late we stumbled upon this izakaya type of yakitoriya. Portions were really small for the most part but tasty, exception to the unaju which I'll talk about more later. Skewers were around U$3,00 to U$3,50 and tiny. I have worked for several Japanese restaurants as a chef and I had not seen skewers as small as Totto's. But the worst part was when I ordered some Unaju (fresh water eel over rice). My wife likes it more saucy as it was very dry and I asked the server if it was possible to BUY some more sauce. He just said NO in a very rude and unapologetic way without giving any excuse for that: just a blunt NO! Japanese culture is all about politeness by expressing and living out OMOTENASHI. Unfortunately that didn't happen to us and we ended up having a real bad experience. I would definitely NEVER come back.
Food was just ok: Though the buffalo cauliflower was perhaps the best I've ever had, all our mains were mediocre at best; boarding on inedible in some cases. Service was attentive but not well educated on the menu. Decor is very cool though.
Absolutely one of my favorite spots for soup dumplings! Nan Xiang is known for their soup dumplings and rightfully so. I try to make the effort to come here every time I'm in Flushing because the food is so good and the price can't be beat.  If you come in the early morning, there is no wait but if you come during the lunch time,  there is quite a bit of a wait. They have so much selection but I always find myself ordering the pork soup dumplings (even if it's early AM.. because really,  I can eat these any time of the day), soy milk and beef scallion pancakes.  The soup dumplings are prepared and cooked to perfection. You can see the ladies preparing them on the side and behind the front desk. The meat in the soup dumpling is flavorful, tender and juicy. The skin is just the perfect texture - not too thin, not too thick and they don't break easily like other restaurants.  I've enjoyed everything I've tried and haven't had a bad experience with the service at all. The staff is efficient in getting your food at a reasonable time. FYI cash only.
"The good thing about Chinatown is all Chinese food is ridiculously affordable. The competition is fierce, making consumers very happy but not so much for the businesses trying to make ends meet. Now, on to the nitty-gritty. I've had this place bookmarked for ages now. Though I've been on E. Broadway numerous occasions, I never realized how many times I've sillily walked past it. Lam Zhou may have an ""A"" on the outside but the cleanliness is just ""alright"". You share tables here, or as they say 搭檯 in HK/China. For a measly $20, you can luxe it out with 2 bowls of pulled noodles and a plate of dumplings. I opted for #2 beef brisket soup noodle (牛腩拉麵) and #18 fried dumplings (窩/""鍋""貼). I have a sensitive tongue for MSG and #2 was jam packed with it and other sodium goodies. There were only 2 pieces of bok choy - wish there were more! The pulled noodles were okay; they were definitely missing the 彈牙的口感 that I'm all too familiar with and expect in a good bowl of pulled noodles. The brisket was tough and chewy at times. Everyone raves about the fried dumplings and yes, I do think they're slightly better than other places. What makes them stand out is the meat/stuffing is marinated. With every bite, you get soy marinade oozing out. I suppose they're worth trying but don't expect anything mind blowing. Lam Zhou in 4 words: quick, easy, cheap thrills."
Not sure what all the fuss is about with this place. Ordered Pad See Ew... a standard. The noodles were terrible -- no actual flat wide noodles, just blobs of shredded up noodle bits. I called to complain and they argued with me that the noodles were fine and this is the way they serve them. If that's true, what a bummer. If it's not, and this was an error, they should have just given us a credit. Noodles aside, meat was tough and tasted old; flavor was neither here nor there. Won't be ordering here again; I'll spend my money on a place that a) has good food and b) cares what their customers think.
Really delicious appetizers! The chicken liver pâté still has me drooling the next day and the corned short ribs were also texturally wonderful. The service had me confused. Our first waitress just seemed utterly apathetic and out of it, and only smiled at my guy friend and ignored me when I asked how she was doing, barely acknowledged me when I was ordering. My friend suggested it might be because she thought he was paying (I paid). The second server who brought us our bill was super nice and lovely.  I'll chalk it up to end of night tiredness and definitely visit again for yummy snacks. It's right across the street from my new studio and their food was just flat out lovely.
The Red, White and blue special is a bargain!  For $9.99 you get 6 oysters or clams and a glass of beer or wine.  We started with one order of clams and another of oysters.  The clams were so tasty and briny that we order another 1/2 dozen!  The oysters were good too but not as good as the clam that day.  I could not drink that night so sub a glass of ice tea for the beer/wine with no issues. My daughter had the clam chowder and it was very tasty with chucks of clams and potatoes.  What I like most is that they do not use a lot of cream in the chowder and that it was not too thick.  The next dish we tried was the Salmon/Tuna tartar which came with homemade chips.  This dish was just ok.  The fish was fresh but it lacked seasoning and also not enough chips for the amount of fish.  This dish was disappointing. For the main course we had the Pan-Roasted Red Snapper w BBQ shrimp and grits.  The Red snapper was very good, seasoned well and the skin was crispy.  The BBQ shrimp and the grits were a miss!  The over sauced shrimp was very salty and had a weird sweetness to it.  The cheesy grits were way too thick, like mortar.  We love grits so we were really bummed with this. I would definitely come back here in the future but stick with the simpler items. Last time we had the fish tacos and it was delicious!
This place has been booked marked for some time because I love a lychee martini but I have mixed reviews.  While the drink was really delicious, the bar itself was very very loud and the decor was a little lacking.  I expected it to be a little fancier.
Made a resso for 7 pm on a Thursday for me, my sister, and brother-in-law. Looks like we didn't need even need one. Although the place is small, it still wasn't even half full.  I've been wanting to try Benemon for a while since it has such great reviews on Yelp. They also marketed themselves as 'Japanese comfort food', which I thought would be a nice change of pace from all the sushi and ramen places out there. While I'm sure the dishes on their menu probably are considered comfort food, it wasn't very comforting because it wasn't very good.  To start, we had the karaage fried chicken. It was super oily so I was only able to stomach one piece.  For my entree, I went with the pork katsu curry. The pork cutlet was actually perfectly fried. I tend to stay away from pork chops and cutlets for that very reason, but I decided to take a risk and I was pleasantly surprised. What I wasn't pleasantly surprised by was the curry. It was really salty and sour, like they had put too much vinegar in there.  I tried a bite of chicken from my sister's oyako don (grilled chicken, onions, scallions and eggs cooked in a rich soy sauce broth) and wasn't a fan. It seemed like a pretty small portion. The chicken also had that old leftover taste, so maybe it wasn't such a bad thing that the portion was small.  Nothing else on the menu really appealed to me and of the dishes that I did try, I didn't like it that much so I doubt I would come back. I haven't seen a lot of places that boast Japanese comfort food, so I guess I'll just have to keep searching for one that I actually like.a
AMAZING!!! Staff is so sweet and the carne asada tacos were SO GOOD!!! I've been. Wanting some GOOD tacos for a WHILE and these hit the spot! I went twice in one day because once wasn't enough hahaha
I love this pizza! It's either Adrienne's or Roberta's for me. The water ferry is running now hop on over for some pizza! Its a pit stop now if I take the ferry back to BK from work. Got pepperoni, mushrooms and something else these guys also own The Dead Rabbit & The Growler across the street go in there order some shandys and work up an appetite!
Came here for a lunch a while ago and was pretty disappointed. Friend and I tried two different rice entrees (not stone pot bibimbap). Nothing special about them at all. Also no free appetizers. Lighting in this place was also weird. Cheap drinks but won't be back here again.
The Mr. requested nice, authentic Italian for his birthday dinner this past Saturday evening, and after much research and deliberation, we made a reservation at Pepolino. We were running a touch late for our 9:00 p.m. reservation thanks to traffic in the rain, but were there by 9:10.  When I arrived in the door, there was one couple waiting ahead of me and 6 more came in the door right after me, making for a very, very hectic entryway and some uncertainty as to whether they actually had our reservation.  Eventually, they requested that we wait upstairs at the bar, saying it would be a few minutes for our table. So, we go upstairs to the bar... and a less inviting bar situation I haven't found in a restaurant.  There were NO seats at the bar, which I suppose makes sense, considering the public area in front of the bar served as both dining area (tables behind us) and the hallway for servers coming out of the kitchen as well as waiting area for patrons like us.  We ended up waiting a solid 40 minutes for our table, despite having made a reservation. To top that off, they tried to seat us at the table that we'd been standing almost on top of for the last half hour.  Fortunately, it didn't take much of a fuss for them to separate a couple of tables near the window downstairs instead. Once we were seated, the food was decent.  Their tomato flan is excellent.  We decided on an appetizer and entree each.  The Mr. had the Crostina di Salsiccia e Stracchino, which was okay, if one dimensional, and the lamb shank stew.  The crostini needed something to brighten the flavor.  I had the Melanzane e scamorza, which was better, if a bit heavy on the oregano, and the fish special, which was very flavorful. Because we didn't get seated for dinner until 10:00 p.m., by the time we got to desert, they were out of the ricotta cheesecake, the creme brulee and the creme caramel!   Overall, the food was good and our waiter was pleasant, but we've had similar meals for MUCH less money.  We will not be visiting this restaurant again.  The experience isn't worth repeating.
Initially I was hesitant to come here I am a seafood person but was afraid it would be weird noodles and such but it was legit best food I have had . Everything was amazing . The decor was spectacular . The music was kind of loud I know I'm not a city girl so I am used to low key music it's hard to have a conversation with people you are with . We ordered for appetizer the rock shrimp which was great but I preferred it to be less on hot sauce and more mayo flavor but that's just me it's a little heavy but what do you expect it's fried food. We also had the tuna tare tare which I felt was super tiny it comes rolled up for you I would have preferred it to be open and I just use won ton to eat it but that's my preference . We also got the yellow tail which was pretty good out of all the appetizers . For entree we ordered the jumbo shrimp and the sea bass . Wow my sea bass was beyond delicious like amazing I didn't see anyone post a pic so I'll add that in. My husband got the shrimp which was great as well but also fried so you start to feel hoe heavy it feels it would have been nice to have it grilled or something .  For dessert we had this pistachio mousse thing seriously died and went to heaven so good.  You pretty much need reservations unless you plan on  sitting in bar area which was actually not bad we had reservations for a later time but came early and just decided to sit in bar lounge which has full menu and is pretty much same part of restaurant for upstairs perspective unless your a cry baby  like lady next to us who insisted on sitting downstairs .
I was excited to try Pearl's -- but the crappy service guarantees I will not be returning. When you mess up someone's order and then not only do you get an attitude with them about it, you don't bother apologizing--you lose a customer. Who ever owns this place, here's some advice: customers (and their word of mouth) keep your doors open. Treat them better.
I love Greek food (eat it about once or twice a week) and I just do not see what the hype in this place is. We wanted to visit Astoria and see what New York's Greek food scene is like, so we went to Yelp's #1 rated spot, this place. The food was really just OK, our fish with crabmeat tasted almost spoiled and quite bland, and the appetizers and dips were really just fair. I've been to Greek restaurants worldwide, and I just don't see the hype. The service was extremely lagging, and we were absolutely parched for water, and couldn't really seem to attract our waiter's attention, ever. It was nice of them to give us a complementary dessert at the end though (I think they do this for every table?). I hate writing a low star review, but I am just so surprised this is Astoria's #1.
Had the papaya salad with peanuts and dried shrimp I recommend getting it spicy or mild. It's a decent portion for two people to share. Also had the drunken noddles with beef and pork noodle soup with flat noodles. I like how the dishes weren't overly salty or seasoned compared to other Thai restaurants I've been to. I also had the Thai iced tea without bubbles and thought it was too sweet.  Overall it was decent food I would come back to try the other dishes.
Came here tonight after a very nice experience we already had before... tonight the experience was not even close to the previous one. It was actually awful. Starting from the waiter ( wearing a tank top showing his nipples and sweaty hairy armpits), the service and everything that followed that.  The appetizer was served on a board that could barely hold the food, and half of the food was touching the table ( hopefully cleaned before) not the most hygienic thing...  We ordered 2 burgers and 3 sandwiches. We personally didn't like the 3 lamb sandwiches and sent them back. The funny waiter told us: oh I can see you didn't like it, you ate it half tho!!  we gave 3 bites and we didn't like. Besides the number of bites a waiter should not approach a table with that sarcastic attitude.  After we sent the sandwiches back it took forever to have 3 burgers and the temperature of the patties was of course wrong!!! Nobody even came to clean the table after we ate the appetizer, we had to put the dirty dishes on the side. We ate the 3 burgers because we were hungry and honestly we wanted to get out of the place.  After we asked for the check, we noticed the sarcastic unprofessional waiter, added the 20% of gratuity without letting us know. We spoke to the manager  Max who tried to be nice but I think his customer service skills were pretty basic and poor. He took off the ADDED GRATUITY which was a correct thing to do and that's it. Even if he knew we sent the sandwiches back he didn't come to the table to check and talk to us like any other manager would have done. The whole experience was awful, and the waiter was more focused to drink his beer while working, than waiting tables. I would never go back again, even if the manager gave us some free drink tickets. He should have taken care of some items from our actual bill and invite us back for drinks. Awful food, awful experience, awful everything.
"Being in Dumbo which is obviously baby friendly, Cecconi's is NOT baby friendly. I'm all for leaving babies at home past a certain hour, but my 2 friends and I strolled into Cecconi's on a Wednesday afternoon with our strollers around 3pm and were turned away. They claimed they ""weren't seating new parties"", but we watched 3 additional groups come and sit while we were ushered out. We offered to fold our strollers to save room, but they told us that wasn't an option. I'm a big fan of Cecconi's in LA, but this was truly upsetting and I would not recommend going if you have kids."
"This was the worst dining experience I have ever had. I went for a bike ride and decided to stop in for happy hour since I had never been to this new dining hall before.I sat at the bar and waited then waited some more for one of the waiters to bring me a menu. Nope it didn't happen so I had to flag the bartender down and ask for one.Then I waited some more for someone to take my order. Nope I had to flag someone down again. No one gave me water until I was there for 20 minutes. Then when My food was ready the waiter bypassed me and gave it to one of their off duty employees who was also sitting at the bar because I was soooo invisible! I had to stop him from eating my food and say ""hey that's mine."" I have never been treated like this at a restaurant and I will never go back or visit any of the other Boqueria locations in the city. You would be wise to stay away too."
Thai Sliders is near the Financial District and offers Thai-inspired food at a hefty price considering the portions given. The restaurant has a bit of an awkward set-up with about three tables in the front. These table feel cramped and seem like they are only meant for larger parties of around 8-10. There is a counter in the front room that serves sushi. The restaurant offers more seating in the back but this area seems under wait-staffed.  I arrived with a semi-large group at around 7:15 pm on a Sunday night. The restaurant was rather busy but there was not wait to be seated. Water also came to the table very quickly. However, the quickness was quick to diminish as the night progressed. Another 15 minutes went by before a waiter came to the table to introduce herself. Once food was ordered, the wait time was an additional 45 minutes for not a large party. Furthermore, my party's entrees came out at different times. One entrée came out within 5 minutes, another at 20, another at 30, and the last few at 45. The bill was what really took a long time. After the wait staff cleared our table, our waiter to an ADDITIONAL 30 minutes to finally hand over the check. This was followed by a slow return of credit cards. I ordered the Veggie Pad Thai and it came with noodles, carrots, broccoli, green peppers, and garnish. The food was warm yet lacked flavor. The noodles seemed a bit overcooked and were quite chewy. The vegetables were so steamed that they no longer tasted like anything. The portion was rather small. I was finished with the entire meal within 7 bites. The Veggie Pad Thai (one of the cheaper items) also came with a hefty price tag of over $15. I know that the place is known for their sliders. I attempted to order a slider, but after I ordered, the waiter informed me that they had run out of the veggie slider and that he could offer me the Pad Thai instead. Overall, I was not satisfied with my experience at Thai Sliders and it is unlikely I will return.
I decided to have breakfast here one cold early morning. I had high expectations for this restaurant. However, I did not feel it meet my expectations. The atmosphere is pretty chill and literally CHILL. The day I came was pretty chilly outside. I was expecting to be warm in this restaurant. Nope, didn't get that at all. I sat there with my lover slightly trembling while we wait for our food.  I had the skillet eggs shashuka. The skillet includes bacon, cheese, spinach, and some tomato like sauce, with 2 slices of bread on the side. Everything tasted bland. Even when i mixed it together it wasn't very flavorful. My first bite was without mixing all the components in skillet. I tasted it individually to taste the flavor of each. My second bite was with everything mixed. The tomato-like sauce was underneath was not to my liking at all. Personally, it just wasn't to my liking.  The 2 slices of bread on the side was so difficult to eat. It was like a piece of wood. It was too hard. It really did hurt my mouth. I tried to place the skillet's components on it to soften it, but that hardly made a difference. I also tried the smoked trout. That was nothing special.The eggs were extremely bland. I tasted absolutely no seasoning. Apparently there were bones in the trout..
Amazing food, awesome, Attentive staff, great. Can be a be noisy at time, but well worth it.
really cool atmosphere (very hipster) and the staff are super friendly and helpful with decision making. The pizzas are de LICIOUS, and the sparkling red wine, forgot the name went really well with it - recommended by our server.  Dessert was the best part, really yummy, some unconventional options and finished off the meal really well, not too big not too small! Great find
Came here for my anniversary, was attracted to this place because of the beautiful view and great ambiance. To start the place is beautiful. Very classy with a cool Brooklyn vibe, however the service simply SUCKS. Our waiter did not come to our table until about 15 minutes after we sat down. He was very short and barley came back to check on us. What I can say is the woman who was busing the tables was more attentive and friendly then our waiter. The food was very good. We had the meatballs to start and the pizza. Very delicious. Overall, this place was very good, however the service definitely needs some work..ESPECIALLY for the price you are paying.
This place, when you hit it at a good angle, transports you to another time in the best way. But when you miss that hit, you're fucked. The past thrice times I went there the service was nothing short but rude, dismissive, and condescending. It was such unattractive behavior, I left and really don't think I'm going to attempt that place again. What's the deal? Prices are above average (for TriBeCa standards) so it's obvious you can tip your staff to at least be borderline polite.  I'm not asking you to swoon me and kiss my hand but c'mon, show you give a shit and pay attention to your clientele. Your staff may not recognize who exactly the clientele is or is with.
I would give this restaurant a 3.5. I came here with my friends for brunch. The restaurant is a cute small place. We ordered the waffle and bacon to share. The waffle was not good at all, the yogurt on top of the waffle was sour and so were the fruits. It wasn't a well done waffle, it was very doughy. The bacon was good but definitely not worth $6 for four pieces. I ordered the Jack's breakfast which was steak and eggs. My plate was really good, the steak was perfectly cooked and the eggs were good. The potatoes that came on the side were a bit weird and bland. The sauce that came with the dish was kind of like a chimichurri sauce which made the dish more flavorful. One of my friends ordered the Mediterranean dish which was okay, it was nothing special. It consist of eggs and a Mediterranean salad. My other friend ordered the Madame Freda which was really good. It was full of flavor. My other friend ordered the breakfast bowl which was mostly like a salad, it wasn't to her liking. The cantaloupe juice was very watered down. The price is super expensive, it's worth it if you get the right thing. It's definitely a hyped up place but it was worth the try.
So I come here once a week and sometimes twice, its a non tipping restaurant but the lunch price is higher to include the service charge. The food is really good but for the second time, I ordered Kaisen bowl and they are missing certain ingredients. Both time they would substitute with a different fish but it is never the equivalent to the type of fish that's missing. I understand I also accept their offer on the substitution but still...and the service is really just okay. I have higher expectation at a Japanese restaurant.
Stopped in here for a quick lunch with my best friend who was visiting from the South. It was right across from the hotel that she was staying in and had a nice layout for people watching. The service was pretty good. He kept our water glasses full. The Margherita pizza wasn't as good though. The sauce was bland and sparse. However, the sautéed brussel sprouts were really tasty and that means a lot coming from me because I hate them little green suckers. The other customers seemed to really enjoy their drinks so I might come back to try them out...
"My first time in New York and my local friend was taking us around. We came across this place searching for an authentic Italian place with good food and one of the first places that popped up was Benito one. Reviews seemed great and we immediately rushed to the restaurant.  Poor service along with bad food totally ruined our evening. Green salad was made with lack of fantasy, just some leaves from the bag and 3  tomato slices. Stuffed mushrooms and garlic bread for appetizers just helped us not to starve to death while waiting for our main dishes, which took them more than 30 minutes. Stuffed mushrooms were nothing they suppose to be, mushrooms themselves tasted not really fresh and stuffing was so overcooked that it was hard to say what we are eating. At that point we still hoped main course will make it up. It should've been perfect regarding the waiting time, but raviolis felt like they were precooked and warmed in microwave and topped with that stuffing from the mushrooms. Even though the owner assured us it was not precooked. Who cares if it feels like that? Chicken pasta was OK but chicken was extremely dry.  Bacon in carbonara felt awful and pasta itself was plain.  None of us was able to finish any of the dishes even though we were hungry like dozen wolves. On top of that it was a handwritten 'service' fee in our bill - 18 dollars which was more than 15% of our bill and total with this amount added. That's when we asked the waiter if it's a suggestion or we have to pay it. He wasn't solid that that's just a suggestion saying ""oh when I go to a bar and buy a beer they always charge me 18% may be you're pretty that's why you don't get charged""....  We felt awful and felt that we should let the owner know. After talking with him we were suggested the desserts to cover it up, but our only wish was to run away and never ever come back. Only obstacle to that was a terrible stomachache after the dinner in Benito One which was a not nice reminder even few hours later."
Insanely cheap! Great for late night eats but the soup dumplings here are just OK. 6 pork XLB (soup dumplings) for $5.95. 3 stars. The skin was too thick and slightly undercooked. Generously meaty and soupy though. I also like that they give you tongs so that you don't break the skin. 6 crab and pork XLB for $6.95. 2.5 stars. Stick to the pork ones especially if you're not a fan of crab roe. Seafood taste overpowered the pork. Fried Bean Gluten $5.95. 5 stars. An acquired taste so stay away if you're not a fan of greasy tofu. Flavorful and just the right amount of chewy,They make it just like my aunt does back in Taiwan. The mushrooms and bamboo shoots that accompany the gluten are equally delightful. Cold sweet soy milk for $1.50. 5 stars. Authentic. None of that American Silk crap.
"I've never eaten here sober. Is it fair that I'm reviewing this then? Yes, because I need to exercise my fingers besides the daily rub and tug-Ohh-war I face with my arch nemesis, The D. And by that, I don't mean Detroit.  The service here is pretty decent for a Chinatown spot. No yelling or deer in headlights looks due to their English proficiency. Yes, the food comes out so fast you wonder how long it was sitting there before they nuked it and sent it to your table. Sometimes, you need to stop overthinking it, put it in your mouth and eat. No pause.  The Roti Canai is smallish and the curry is rich and flavorful. You kind of have to, because who doesn't like dunking stuff into a rich brown sauce with a random piece of chicken swimming in it? I don't share this; sharing is stupid when it's this small and you're going to kill it in three to four bites. Don't let that overzealous server take the curry in her hurry, because you'll want to pour that over your girl, i mean, rice... later.  The crispy squid tentacles (not to be confused w/testicles) are a hot mess to look at, however those buggers are delicious. Salty and sweet with a crunch like chips, which is how you should treat them: eat the whole damn thing without remorse & accept your inner fat kid, Kenny.  The water spinach with shrimp paste is a yes. Not only is it delicious, you need something that's green at the table to make yourself feel better and so that 5 star from Wisconsin who's sitting at the next table will ask, ""What's that?"" Boom, instant ice breaker and you've now found your future ex (yes, this really happened, but not here & she was more like a solid 3).  That Hainanese Chicken that you see in all the pics is a staple. Juicy, moist, flavorful and served cool, I order it every time, but feel like that basic bitch who always orders Pad Thai and doesn't know why. The irony.  Beef Rendang? Yes. Just...yes. Period.  Singapore rice noodles. I sometimes come here with a drinking buddy of mine and he always orders this, which to me is just ok (I'm not a pasta/noodle fanboy, unless it's swimming in broth). Reasons why he orders this: 1) I eat a bite of it, and 2) I never want to take this home (via doggy bag). So, he's got another meal for the next day; don't we all have one of these kinds of  douchey friends in our lives? He is also the type that will eat more then his share of the chicken, if you don't keep up with his eating pace. And he wonders why women can't stand him after a few dates. No, I'm not projecting.  The pineapple fried rice here is good, but the salted fish one is better. It's not too salty and has mucho flavor. I don't get ordering fried rice with heavy sauced dishes, though. If you already got the curry from the Rotti Canai and all the gravy from other dishes, why would you not just get white rice as the vehicle to enjoy that goodness? It's equivalent to ordering, say, mashed potatoes that have been seasoned with truffle oil and dried, unicorn blood, but then you pour gravy over it and ruin the dish which you just paid $12. Get the coconut (or just white rice), if you've got a lot of sauce you plan on sopping up later. It's cash only, which pisses me off, because I get double points at restaurants on my card. The bathroom just might be one of the best in Chinatown; i'm talking at least 2nd world quality, easily. They aren't open late night, so the 3/4 a.m. late night crawl won't happen here. There aren't many options for Malaysian and although I'm no expert on the cuisine, it's got the one factor that's THE most important reason, in any cuisine...it taste good, Floecia."
Man oh man, what a great place with great food. Came with my girlfriend and ordered a whole slew of food. My top favorites were the truffle mac and cheese (amazing!), steak with cauliflower mash and greens, angry sweet potatoes. We also ordered the tuna tataki, seafood pancake, popcorn chicken- all of which were pretty solid, though nothing mind blowing.  Pricing was great and 2-3 dishes per person is more than sufficient. The drinks in the plastic bags were tasty and sweet, not strong enough, but large quantities.   Lastly, the matcha bread pudding is a must try!!!! Probably one of my favorite desserts in the city and a definite winner for any green tea lovers.   Service was great. Waiters and waitresses introduced each dish to us prior to serving, so definitely gave a high end feel.  The restaurant overall is super chill and casual.
"My second time here. Food was good. But we felt uncomfortable being rushed. Even the hostess said ""you have 15 minutes to order & we're starting a timer"". A timer? Really?! Then we put our order in & the waiter goes ""if u want drinks or dessert you have to order that now too"" Who orders dessert before even getting anything!?? This was Father's Day so you'd think they'd be a little bit more considerate."
Even though the bartender gave us a look, it was still great.  Make sure you make a reservation because we waited over 2 hours.  Yes, our friends visiting really wanted to eat there.   The crawfish does not have a lot of meat.  They usually don't have as much, so I would recommend more shrimp, and lobster.
I have to say, I was really looking forward to coming to B&L. The hubby was excited because his BFF is coming to town soon, and the new of them love to dine out.  But WOW. To be blunt, two bites into my burger and lobster called The Beast and I was wishing I was at Shake Shack, which I loathe and find repulsive. That's how bad this $30 piece of crap on a plate.  This was the kind of burger I would expect to get from one of those street truck vendors, greasy and all kinds of wrong, and not in the good way. Seriously, if I didn't know better, I would have thought the lobster was some kind of imitation. I'll trust that it wasn't.  There was nothing appetizing about it.  Then there was the hubby's burger. The fois gras he described as fois dirt.  I can not remember hating a restaurant as much as I hated this one. A horrible meal.  The lobster bites were edible. But really, put something in a doughy filling, and it'll probably be doable. But, it seemed like something you'd find on sale in the supermarket frozen section. I'm not entirely sure they didn't get it there.  If I could give no stars I would.  The service was okay. Though, I'm not sure who our waiter was. It changed twice. And, not because it was busy. It was 5:30. The customers were pretty sparse. Just not sure they knew what was going on.  There is nothing about this experience that I ever want to repeat. Don't get the hype.  Though, we did go to a movie after, and  I gained an appreciation for concession stand food. I envied the lucky folks eating that crap.  Even the fries were horrible. Who messes up fries?  My recommendation, stay home and throw Velveeta on some Spam. It'll probably taste close to our meal.
Although it's a beautiful setting the boat was SUPER rocky and my friend and I both got sea sick. Also it's pretty over priced. I guess you're paying for the view. You can't get any drink other than exactly what's on the menu (seems like they are pre-made). In theory it's a great idea, but for those who get easily sea sick, just beware.
Food was very good! The process of just eating the crabs and the lobster was madd fun! Realllyyy flavorful! Got wings as well..not really worth it. French fries were great though!
In quest for the best grilled octopus I thought I should try the Greek as the reviews for octapodi is raving! We were so disappointed! It was chewy and had too much olive oil on it( just TOO much) The restaurant is cute though and service was supper polite and fast.
Although my dinner was ok my wife and daughter did not like the place at all. Had pu up platter which was decent and their fried chicken which was ok. Because I've travelled all over and have eaten at Yardbirds in Miami I was quite disappointed but gauging from New York residents reviews I guess their fried chicken is favored within NYC.  My wife and daughter had the hummus and roasted chicken and I can't even repeat their rating.
If you're considering hosting your wedding here, please look elsewhere!  While the location is gorgeous and the food is delicious, the event staff and their protocols are completely unacceptable. You aren't even allowed to speak to the event manager on the phone until you've signed a contract (?!?!?) AND she doesn't respond to your emails for at least a week. They will nickel and dime you for everything, and are not willing to budge on any costs whatsoever.  When I planned my wedding, I wanted to work with vendors that were excited to share my special day with me. Aurora made me feel like they hated hosting weddings, and I was not going to pay them $30,000 if they weren't going to at least pretend to be nice.  Also, the base cost for this place is outrageous. You can have a wonderful wedding elsewhere for much cheaper! When I kindly told their event manager, Irene, that we would move forward with another venue that was more accommodating, she didn't even respond. That is bad business.
I prefer these lobster rolls to Luke's - they're meatier! I really love the Connecticut roll, which has just butter (no mayonnaise) and warm lobster (Luke's has cold meat). Know that you can order an a la carte roll for $18.95, even though they don't post this on the menu!!! (They only post a $24 combo on the menu.) It's definitely a pricey lunch for what you get, but delicious!
My first time on City Island so I wanted to try one of their most popular spots. I knew it was more cafeteria style and nothing fancy at all but that doesn't mean it has to be dirty. Inside the tables were filthy, and sticky, the floor was too and covered with flyaway napkins. Outside wasn't much better with kids feeding the birds. At least they have wires over the tables so they don't fly directly over you. The fried calamari and fries were disappointing. Big portions but more greasy than crispy. The steamed clams had a funny taste to them and the garlic butter didn't really mask it. The clam chowder was delicious though.
Half off oysters and beers during happy hour were a plus. Crab cakes were a bit too salty, otherwise crispy and good. Scallop and mushroom risotto were pretty good. Mahi mahi...I'm glad this wasn't my main dish. There was something slightly sour about it and it tasted somewhat bland to me. This may be the case because my scallops were better in comparison. Nothing mind blowing knowing that this place has fab reviews (although some places still give you a pleasant surprise even with the high expectations. For me, that didn't happen with this place.) But this also means no let-downs either. The place gives you a whiskey sponge cake at the end - a nice freebie to end your meal with.
You know, I gotta be real with you - I was super skeptical coming here because I'm from California, and I automatically assume that elote is way better there. Boy, was I wrong!!! The elote (Mexican grilled corn on the cob) had just the right amount of mayo/butter and seasonings!!! I could easy eat 3 or 4 of them myself, but of course I refrained from doing so because that would just make me a fatty.  It's a small joint with limited seating areas. I wouldn't go out of my way to go here, but it's definitely a good stop to make if you're going on a food crawl. Standard street parking per usual in the city.
I came here with a bunch of friends for dinner. We made a reservation and were seated promptly. We ordered a bunch of apps and sushi rolls which all tasted good but nothing spectacular.  The two most memorable dishes was the calamari appetizer and the ramen. One huge disappointment though was the omakase. I shared it with a friend and the fish was sliced paper thin. It wasn't cheap either. I never had a omakase like that before. It's definitely not worth it here.
As we wandered around Chelsea Market for the first time, we gravitated towards Los Tacos No.1 because it had the longest line and pretty much every other person we walked by had a delicious looking and smelling taco in his/her hand. I tried the steak and pollo taco- delicious! My friend tried the cactus(?) one, and ordered it without knowing what it was and she said it was...unique.  Anyway, even though the line was ridiculously long, they were very organized in preparing and handing out the food, and we enjoyed our meal!
Great place to satisfy my Chinese stomach:) The restaurant isn't big so it's better to go early to wait for your table since they don't take reservation.  Highly recommend their soup dumplings! We also had sour hot soup with crispy duck and pepper beef. They are all delicious , services was warm and fast.
Although I cook Italian food all the time, I'm not a big fan of Italian food if I have to eat outside but after trying out this restaurant. I realized that Italian food can be delicious too. I usually cook it with my fusion spices. So I like my cooking but I must say that their food is pretty delicious and must try!!
Ordered some 'penne a la vodka with chicken' here for lunch. Taste was mediocre for a lunch plate that cost $20. Overpriced. Before stopping by, I had called on a multiple times to no avail. Ended up walking over top place my order and the guy upfront was pretty rude. Chicken was a bit burned, tasteless, and from what it looked liked...just thrown ontop of the pasta as an after thought.  Won't be going back. Overpriced, mediocre food, rude management.
Went to Adrienne's Pizza bar for dinner tonight. Ordered a Caesar salad, arugula salad, and pizza, which was more than enough for 4 people. The house red wine was also good!
Kinda different.  Yet unsatisfying.  The burger was good. Minus the fact I had the take off the big hard over cooked pieces of bacon. But the fact that my loaded fries came out cold and salty.  It was not worthy! My fiancée tots were extremely salty! Of all the wonderful New York meals.  This could have been skipped over.  I would have enjoyed 5 guys more I'm sure.
Kudos to this place! There was a bit of a wait for a group of 5 on a Thursday night, we went around 9pm for a late dinner. They told us the wait would be 15 minutes but we were seated quicker! The Thai iced tea is good! You can never go wrong with Thai iced tea. I ordered the Kea Mao with tofu and it was delicious. The texture of the broad noodles were cooked to a chewy perfection and there was plenty of tofu to fill me up. The Panang curry and Green curry were both really good choices as well. The Green curry has a bit of a kick to it so beware if you cannot handle some spicy.  The Pineapple Fried Rice is a bit disappointing; the rice is a bit undercooked and portion is small. The Up Thai Fried Rice Claypot is amazing...filled with seafood, chicken, and Chinese sausage. The rice is cooked to a perfect texture as well, and full of flavor. For dessert, we shared a sticky rice dish that I forget the name to now. It was so good... Overall a great experience -- the decor is on point!
Delicious Pizza. The base is the best I have had. It is thin and well seasoned but not too thin so you can still pick it up.  Also hs the perfect amount of chew to it. The toppings were delicious and the service was great.  a rare 5/5 for pizza from me
I never hated meat so much after eating the Bo Ssam. Seriously, SO MUCH MEAT. No more meat ever again. Actually this sentiment only lasted that night and I wanted more meat the next morning. My friend made a reservation for the Bo Ssam on a Sunday night. She had 2 spots left and I was so happy to be invited. We went with 9 people overall and killed it!! My friend and I pretty much carried the group and ate the rest of the meat when everybody else stopped. Definitely come with 10 people if you don't want to feel overstuffed after. The table next to us only had 4 people, but they ordered both the bo ssam and the duck ssam. Such ballers. I was super impressed at first, but I saw at the end each person had a giant doggie bag. The Bo ssam came with a dozen oysters, two large bowls of white rice, lettuce, ssam sauce, pureed kimchi sauce, regular kimchi, and ginger scallion sauce. I loved the ginger scallion sauce. It reminds me of my dad's ginger scallion sauce, except my dad's has more ginger in it. Kind of biased, but I think my dad's version is better hehe. With that sauce and also the saam sauce, I couldn't stop eating the meat. The pureed kimchi was interesting, but I preferred the other sauces. The meat itself was so tender and fall of the bone, but had this crispy exterior bark. There were some insanely fatty parts and one hunk which was dryer than the rest, but douse it with ssam sauce and you're good to go.  We were all so stuffed at the end, so we only got one dessert to split among the 9 in our group. We ordered a yuzu sake ice cream soft serve with black sesame and Thai basil. The ice cream was really herbaceous from the basil and has a hint of sake. My favorite part was the black sesame soil at the bottom. I guess we digested pretty fast because we went over to Momofuku Milk Bar nearby to get cookies and more ice cream. I have never been to either places before, so glad to have tried both in one night.
"So, I'd like to preface this review with I have worked in food service before, and I appreciate the hard work that goes into the food industry. As someone who has worked in food service, I am appreciative of good service and good food. Unfortunately, neither good service nor good food was to be found tonight at Milk and Roses. My boyfriend and I were visiting New York on vacation and this place had many good reviews online, from most romantic places to eat. Many reviews confirmed that the restaurant was intimate, had live music, and had great, organically sourced Italian food and delicious oysters. Unfortunately, my expectations for good atmosphere, good music, and good food were set too high and were shattered by my actual experiences. Lets start from the beginning when I entered the restaurant. My boyfriend and I were barely acknowledged as we entered, there was no formal host to seat people. We had to seat ourselves. It took a while from the time we entered and took our seats to the time we were acknowledged by our waiter, whom from this point we will refer to as ""Jacque"", due to his French sounding accent and the fact we never got his name. The place was loud and full of hipsters. The atmosphere could be considered romantic, if not for the customers talking loudly and the live music, which I was expecting calm jazz, but was really more reminiscent of drunk piano playing than anything resembling a melody. Yes, the place has intimate booths and is candlelit, but the noise level of the patrons destroys any hope of intimacy, as you have to be able to hear your date without screaming over the table in order to have intimacy. I know nightclubs playing top 40 where it is easier to hear what someone is saying next to you than this place. Now that we've established how the place underwhelms on atmosphere, lets address how it underwhelms when it comes to the food. My boyfriend and I were expecting good quality, upscale Italian food, which we have experienced at many places in the Baltimore MD area, such as La Tavola and Sotto Sopra. The latter restaurant which I have reviewed on yelp and which served outstanding, world-class Italian . La Tavola is exceptional as well, so I know good Italian food, but this food received tonight was anything but good. My boyfriend and I ordered a dozen oysters, Tortellini in Brodo (Proscuitto and fontina stuffed tortellini in a chicken consommé), Pasta Genovese (Braised short rib, stewed tomato, onion), with a side of brocollini). For starters, the oysters were small, pleasantly salty, but unspectacular. Its fairly difficult to mess oysters up, so they weren't exceptional, but they weren't particularly memorable either. Sadly, the forgettable oysters were the best part of the meal.  The Tortellini in Brodo came out as what looked to be ricotta stuffed pasta shells in chicken noodle soup broth, with a taste not far from that. It tasted like stuffed shells you would get at the grocery store in a chicken noodle soup broth, with maybe a little garlic and onion powder added to spice it up.  There was not a bit of prosciutto to be found. The Pasta Genoveses was supposed to be beef shorts ribs with a flavorful pasta. What we received was more akin to cafeteria Beef Stroganoff, with a lot less flavor. My boyfriend commented that the food seemed to be lacking in both flavor and in salt. There was no flavor, but as we had travelled to New York early in the morning, we were hungry and ate our food regardless as it continued to underwhelm. The brocollini were mostly stalk, with very little leafy head. It looked pitiful and was cold. Lets address now our waiter, whom we we will call Jacque. He took too long to get to our table, he provided a bare bones level of service, and when I respectfully brought up the fact the food underwhelmed and lacked any real flavor, he said ""But it is okay to all of our other guests"", which was completely dismissive of the fact that the food was not good at all, and he did not seem to want to rectify the situation. It took me addressing the girl at the bar and another waiter by the name of Simon, who seemed to actually somewhat listen to my opinion about the lack of service and the lack of the flavoring of the food tonight.  Jacque was rude, dismissive, and a shitty waiter. As a person that respects the food service industry, it pains me when I raise legitimate concerns only for them to be dismissed. This scathing review will hopefully raise some red flags at major shortcomings in the quality of service, atmosphere, and food, because I can't fathom how this place manages to stay open and get good reviews. The good reviews online ran in complete contradiction to what I experienced with my date tonight. In summation, the dinner tonight was anything but quiet and intimate, high quality food served with a smile. The food tasted store-bought as best, the service was nonexistent, and the atmosphere was loud and more akin to a dive bar in noise level that an int"
The service is excellent! My entree with shrimps and bacon was amazing. The cocktail however was watered down. My friend got the same thing and agreed. Expect large portions for entrees with delicious leftovers for the next day. The place has a lot of seating and always seems busy.
Came here for lunch on a Tuesday and the place was packed! Good we had reservations.  I had the baked eggplant sandwich. This tasted okay but was a gloopy oily mess. The sandwich also was extremely cumbersome to eat as the filling was constantly escaping its bread enclosure (I am clumsy but even the most elegant of sandwich munchers will agree on this). The cucumber salad was a good refresher from the oily sandwich. Service was pretty slow - waited 30 minutes for our orders. The gave us complimentary bread to snack on while the food was prepared - so didn't mind the wait as much. :-)
"Peter Luger is amazing! I enjoyed every bite of food that they brought out.  We had the bacon and onion&tomato to start. Bacon was amazing! Must get. It's crispy but thick and has kind of a sweet glaze on it I think. The onion and tomato is literally thick slices of onion and tomato and it is delicious. But, if you're the kind of person who would see it and be like ""HEY I can buy onions and tomatoes and chop them up myself!!!!!!"" then probably don't get this appetizer. Three or four different kinds of bread in the bread basket. My favorite was the onion bread. It's good, but don't fill up on it. Just bring it home and enjoy it the next day or something.  For the sides, we got the onion rings, German potatoes, and broccoli. Broccoli and potatoes were again, what it says on the tin. Simple but tasty sides to go with the steak. The onion rings were amazing! I've never had such thinly breaded (is that the right term?) onion rings where you can really taste the onion flavor and the breading doesn't overpower at all. Super crunchy and crispy and thin. I wish I could buy these in the store like potato chips. The steak!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't say I am a steak expert but my mouth and stomach know what they enjoy and they were very happy with the main show of the night. So the waiter comes and drops this huge sizzling plate of meat on your table and then cuts it up and drops a few slices per person. The plate is still sizzling minutes after he leaves, so depending how you like your steak cooked, you may want to take more pieces off the hot plate, otherwise the meat will keep cooking. The steak was delicious and the portions are very good. Eat it with the Peter Luger sauce, or without. PL sauce kind of tastes like a tangier A1. I thought the steak tasted beautiful both with and without. You really can't go wrong eating anything here, just to be clear. (Except if you fill up on bread, then that's kind of going wrong.) Dessert! I love dessert and I loved dessert here. We got the key lime pie, chocolate mousse, and pecan pie. This came with a huge bowl of schlag, which is the homemade whipped cream. What a fantastic way to end a fantastic meal. The schlag was not too sweet and went well with all three desserts we got. All three were great, but the chocolate mousse/schlag combination blew me out of the water. The crust was like a chocolate graham cracker, so the crunch along with the soft mousse was perfect. And somehow, it wasn't too sweet!  Loved the atmosphere. Yes, this is a nice steakhouse, but it is pretty casual and old school. I liked that more, but some people prefer a classier, more intimate ambience. To each their own! Peter Luger is very lively with big groups of families and friends. The waiters are pretty jolly but very attentive. My water was never less than half full. Wonderful experience, would highly recommend."
Place was outstanding. A little small so not ideal if you have a group. I walked in and my eyes opened wide. I ordered a fish taco, fries and they're breakroom burger. Everything was delicious. A little upset I didn't have enough room to try anything else. Oh and their mint lemonade is perfect drink to wash everything down. Will becoming back whenever I'm in the area.
I'm not sure where all the people with the great reviews ate, but it wasn't here. The food was fine, but not nearly as good as Tacuba, which is only a few blocks away. The service was TERRIBLE and the place was (now understandably) deserted at lunch. The iced tea was delicious, but they charged for a refill without telling me they would. And what? No tortillas with chili verde? At least they brought me more chips, so I could make do.
Had a great dinner here at Park Avenue Tavern. The service was really on point, they were very attentive and friendly. Went here with my family last Tuesday afternoon. Had a steak and egg and also Mac and cheese. It was very delish, but it's a bit pricey. I will certainly return to this place soon!
My two stars are because of the waitress she was very rude and snooty with me and really nice to my date. It was a first date and I was nervous and then had to deal with a snooty possibly jealous waitress who answered me rudely when asked a question because I was unfamiliar with craft beer. She gave me a dead look in my face. When it came time to take my food order she look annoyed and stood there as if she wanted an answer that second with her hand on her hip. Usually waitstaff will ask if you need a few minutes and smile. Not this one she gave me a dead look and I smiled and my date said we need a few minutes please. If I had the receipt and her name I would include it on this review but I was on a date and my date paid it. She was white or Italian looking but could be white Latin, with short dark hair and dressed hipster type, it was a Sunday night early June 2017.
I use to love this place but I guess it takes one bad experience. I went there with several coworkers and asked if I can have a separate check and the older heavy set waitress stated cash only you guys can figure it out off one check. Never in my life have I been denied a separate check is she that lazy to flip a page?.  Then when she brought out the wrong food she caught such an attitude saying that's what I ordered and rolled her eyes . This place needs to revaluate their staff and hire more competent employees.
Ordered the yogurt lemon pancakes and was so disappointed. They were dry, flavorless and rather burn on the outside. There was no taste of lemon at all and honestly it felt like I was eating a piece of bread with the little bit of syrup given to me.  I definitely don't recommend ordering this dish.  Nice atmosphere, but I'm just sad I had to pay $14 for burnt, hard, flavorless pancakes... :(  Everyone else dishes looked good tho, I would try something else next time.
Went here for a Sunday brunch with a girlfriend, got there early, around 12pm. It was beautiful outside so the restaurant's open window decor was perfect. The food was decent, nothing great. I got the chicken blt, my friend got the chicken and waffles. We skipped the drinks and got fresh orange juice. The most irritating part of the experience was the server asking us if we were done at least three times. We still had food infront of us and the restaurant was close to empty. Nothing worse than feeling rushed. Regardless, the decor was charming and would love to check out the place for dinner.
"First of all, I was a loyal customer, going in average more than twice a month, two of your wait staff know me and say hi even if they are not waiting on me since I go so often. I go often because I usually love the service and the food (though I'm biased because I'm Colombian) I'm probably not coming back and it all comes down to how I was treated today, saturday November 12th. I went with three other people, two who hadn't ever been and never had Colombian food.  Everything was fine and we had a great time until the check came. I had consumed some more than my friends so I said ""let's split fourways and I'll just add the whole tip to my card"". And so we did. Turns out when we were leaving we were accused by our waitress (Denise) and someone at the cashier of ""paying less"" and that i won't stand for. They made a mistake and tried to blame it on us, it happened like this: They undercharged our cards and we didn't notice, so I just added the tip to my card as I said and proceeded to leave. They should have charged us 32 dollars more or less and charged us 26. so when we were leaving they stopped us and said they made a mistake and would cancel the original transactions and  re-charge because they had put our payments for another table's bill with exactly the same total.  I asked ""why not charge them for our bill instead and let us go, we're leaving?"" and they said something about how tips would be wrongly calculated and so forth, proceeded to cancel our transactions without explaining and without our approval. Then when we saw that we just let them run the cards again, and someone noticed how the values had grown now. We asked about that and that is when the person handling the cashier said (and I quote) ""we are stopping you because you paid less"".  That's where my patience gave up. No, we weren't stopped because WE paid less, we were stopped because YOU made a mistake and mischarged us. And you were embarrasing us and putting us in awkward situation. Sure I took a bit out of Denise's tip (instead of my usual 20% I gave her 15%, I won't remove the whole tip), BUT I'm not coming back This was really uncomfortable and makes me want to never come back. This is not how you treat your loyal customers, you admit the mistake from the beginning and say that you mischarged us and that you should've charged us more money, THAT'S FINE, what isn't fine is lying about some missing tip stuff, trying to hide your mistake and then blame us for it, saying in front of everyone around that ""you haven't paid"" I FELT HUMILIATED. I AM NEVER COMING BACK."
Started out with spring rolls.  They were delicious and the sauce was great. I had the Indian Mee Goreng which is Indian style stir-fried egg noodles. I think that was the best noodle dish I ever tasted. I didn't want it to end..lol We also had the Young Chow fried rice some type of beef dish,I don't remember the name but everything was delicious. Odd thing happened thou. They only served my meal and never served my GF's meal and we never got the fried rice. We started sharing mine thinking the other 2 are on the way. They never came,instead they gave us the check which we were charged for the 2 we never received. I didn't take off any stars for this because they were apologetic and friendly. They quickly brought out the other 2 so we ate our meal in 2 parts instead of everyone's meal coming out together.
2000+ reviews with an average of four stars or higher is nothing to scoff at in our Yelpiverse here, so with expectations sky high I paid a visit to Mamak on a Sunday night only to fall victim to some serious disappointment. Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere? There's absolutely nothing wrong with the service or atmosphere at Love Mamak, and they deserve some serious kudos for the robust delivery system they've built up and integrated into virtually all of the food delivery apps. Star Granted.  Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost? I ordered with my stomach instead of my brain during my visit, and paid $15.00 for an order of highly recommended Pepper Beef, $3.00 for a side of rice, and $7.00 for five fried pork spring rolls that came with lettuce for wrapping and sauce for dipping. That's a lot of money, but it was an unbelievable amount of food, so no complaints here. Star Granted.  Stars 3 and 4: How was the food? So it's here that it really all fell apart. We'll start with the pepper beef, which, while good, was really a marginal amount of beef and a whole lot of peppers and onions as you can see in the picture below. The flavor was there at times but was all too often negated by the chunks of pepper. I ordered coconut rice but was given regular white rice, which was a bit weak, and the fried spring rolls were just okay (would have been better had the lettuce for wrapping not tasted quite unusual). All in all this was just a weak offering across the board. No Stars Granted.  Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could? The Asian scene in the City is simply too competitive for me to say that I would frequent Love Mamak. No Star Granted.
This place SUCKS. In the TWENTY TWO years since I quit drinking, this is LITERALLY the FIRST restaurant/bar I have ever been in that offered me NOTHING BUT WATER. They wouldn't even give me a lousy ICE CUBE! It's a wine bar, but apparently they serve beer. I guess it's beneath them to offer us poor non-drinkers any sort of option at all. The people next to us had a LOT of sediment in their glasses of wine. My Husband was so put off by this silliness that our party paid for our drinks and high-tailed it right down the street to Won Dee Siam II. Which has absolutely NO problem giving me a lousy Coke with all the ice cubes my little heart desires! The menu was very small and VERY EXPENSIVE. I'm not sorry we passed on THAT! We left to the well-deserved sound of the people with the sediment complaining to the bartender! There are a zillion great restaurants in this city. Do yourselves a huge favor and pick one of them!
The food is good but it comes with a political component.  The owner is a proponent of Boycott, Divest and Sanction against Israel. I am not Jewish but I rather not eat at a place that takes a political stance. As such, I will boycott Tanoreen.  There are many other Middle Eastern restaurants in Bay Ridge that are more than equal to Tanoreen and who do not force a political stance in our throats.
When people ask me what to eat around here, I usually point to Xi'an, not because I'm the biggest fan, but because everyone else seems to love it. The one thing I am a huge fan of here is their liang pi. It's actually very good, and I like to ask for their sauce on the side, so I can control how spicy and saucy to make my dish. You can also get a nonspicy version but it just feels a bit lacking, and it's better just to use less of the mild sauce if you can't take spice like me.
"The line can be packed at times. However by the time you get to place your order and get your food someone has finished eating and their is seating available. Be REALLY kind to the people ordering your food! I say this because a lot of people are rude and don't say ""hello"" or acknowledge the servers. The same people seem to over order because they don't know jack about food weight and pricing. (all you had to do was say hello and ask) GREAT FLAVORS."
Don't go in night time! Rude service for sure! Rush you to the death! Their kind of service at night: Sit, order, just drop the whole thing in ur mouth as the way they serve you, pay cash, Get out of here!  They basically take ur water before u ask for check! Wtf? I sat down by 9pm and leave by 9:23pm. 21mins of diner time! Fast eater EVER! Hurray and they can't even wait until I finish typing! HAHA
Thursday Kitchen was such a fun and delicious dining experience! The interior is very homey and intimate, and the staff is attentive and helpful! This was definitely one of the best Korean fusions I've ever had. We started with the adult soju Capri Suns, which were delicious. Had the strawberry and mango flavors, and the strawberry was my favorite!  My favorite dish among the 5 that we had was the Gnocchi. It's like Korean ddukbokki, but even more flavorful and yummy! Perfectly sweet and spicy, and the gnocchi was perfectly soft and chewy. My second favorite dish was the popcorn chicken. Wow, made so well and the sauce that covers works really well with it.  Overall, I really enjoyed this meal and hope to be back again if I'm ever in NYC again!
Refused to seat me because I was with my service dog- who is a legally registered, trained, and uniformed (meaning she was wearing her service dog vest) medical alert animal.
"We ventured after seeing scotch egg on the menu. We were told quickly we weren't welcome- they were short staffed. Trying to follow instructions, I went to order at the bar as directed and was told ""i just had to be patient!""  Groups of people were still hanging out and we had sought the place out, so we stayed and ordered. We were patient and courteous yet the staff talked to us like we were a problem for just being there, when we received any attention at all. I received a hamburger with middle raw (I ordered medium-well but it was raw not medium, not rare). The response we received was so hostile I felt bullied and unwelcome. I kept being told it was rung up wrong- I still don't understand how raw means a ring error. They offered us a new burger but the offer came through clenched teeth and waves of hostility as if I had done something wrong.  I declined the burger. I didn't mention that the appetizer came out with the burger and didn't taste right.  We clearly were not welcome there despite spending close to $50 on a sandwich, one glass of wine, and an app that tasted off. The bill had printed ""customer did not like"" as a another slap as if we had been demanding or fussy. The burger was raw and the service was hostile. So yes the customer did not like."
Stopped in after a long day walking around NYC for a bite to eat.  My wife got the French onion  soup, I had chips and salsa to start, and we shared a grilled chicken sandwich with onion rings, recommended by the staff.   The onion soup was decent.  The cheese had an over power taste so it was set aside.  The chips and salsa were pits chips, not really what I was expecting.  Grilled chicken sandwich was great, onion rings were left on the plate as they were not good.   Overall a mediocre experience and not some place I'd recommend.
Walked by early in the week and saw it had Happy Hour specials... wow! Did not dissapoint... had crispy squid, fried chicken, fresh octopus.... delicious. The saki and sapporo drafts made it a delicious combination.
Terrible Terrible Terrible service. First off, the wait time we were given was 45 minutes. 1.5 hours later we were finally seated. They were not even going in order as the hostess had an open table of four. And instead of seating the next person on the wait list, they went looking for a party of four. I understand it's basically to make more money but it's not a good practice.  Then came out our oysters. An hour later our entrees have not come in. We watched as a table next to us got nearly half of their food. But they came in 40 mins after we did! It made no sense. The service was very poor. I would never recommend this place to anyone. A complete waste of time. I wish I could give them no stars.
I tried this place with my husband and teen son thinking the food was going to be great based on the yelp reviews and ratings but have to say that we were all disappointed. My dish which was the arroz con pollo had the best flavor and was surprisingly pretty good because it had a lot of chicken and the chicken meat was not dry however, everything else we tried was over cooked, lacked in flavor and presentation and left much to be desired. I also ordered the corn on the cob and that was pretty good. But, don't think we will be revisiting.  Just some quick additional comments: Our waiter didn't seem happy to answer any questions we had about the menu being as how it was our first time there. He had a bit of an attitude and didn't seem to know anything so it got a bit frustrating. We thought maybe there was a language barrier and being fluent in Spanish my husband decided to further communicate in Spanish, but still the guy gave the same face and attitude which if it weren't for the fact that we were really hungry and not wanting to ruin our family outing, we would've otherwise just gotten up and left! The decor in this place is interesting; But the one person (ONLY) bathroom is very small and awkward with the tiniest sink I've ever seen anywhere in my life! So tiny that it seems like a practical joke but isn't.
Not a good place.  You can get better similar restaurant nearby. Not worth the money.
This is a go-to brunch spot or for any matter, a go-to food spot!! So great for casual dining with friends. Food: Diverse menu with good vegetarian options and good prices. I've had the tacos al pastor and chorizo con papas, both which were tasty, flavorful and filling. My friend constantly gets the torta de queso blanco y aguacate, which is vegetarian. They make a bomb iced cafe con leche here as well!!  Service: Fast and friendly service for a place that's often crowded.  Ambiance: It's hip, colorful and inviting. A bit diner style. They keep the windows open on nice days and I love that. On a great corner location right in Nolita so the surroundings are always bursting with energy. Etc: My only complaint is that  1)the wait can get long because it's popular  2)there's a gap between brunch and dinner where they close up to prepare for the transition!!
My boyfriend brought home some food from here, after playing golf with his friends, I had a well done burger with French fries and a pickle on the side of the burger, the pickle was good, the hamburger was nice and juicy, they give you a thousand island dressing on the side to put on your burger, nice crisp lettuce and a riped tomato, I must say I really enjoyed my food, I would definitely eat here again, my boyfriend had a medium rare burger with French fries, he also enjoyed his burgers, he must have been really hungry because he had a biscuit covered in gravy with mushrooms which was very good, I just took a small piece, the biscuit came with home fries, they was alright nothing to brag about, I've tasted plenty of home fries from different restaurants and never had good things to say about them, I notice alot of restaurants don't use much seasonings on them and they're so bland, so that's pretty much how I will explain their home fries...overall, I enjoyed my meal, I would recommend them to a friend
Good atmosphere, but everything is extremely salty.  Drinks were bland.
"Items Selected: Pork Steam Buns Fried Pork Dumplings Kung Pao Chicken  Pan Fried Noodles with Beef Originally located in Flushing, the Soup Dumplings such a sensation that locations in Chinatown and Midtown soon followed, Joe's Shanghai is as close to an institution as anything in the Five Boroughs, accolades from the Times, Zagat and several international publications turning each walk-in-only Restaurant into the sort of place both locals and tourists are willing to line up for. Originally founded in 1995, though the praise and décor would make many assume the restaurant that has since expanded to Japan is far older, it was around 2pm on a Saturday that a party of three approached Joe's at 9 Pell Street, the low-ceilinged space completely full with persons of all ages, colors and ethnicities, one of the six-person communal rounds soon to partially open up after a mere ten minutes of standing at the door. Owned by Mei Ping Matsumura and ""Joe"" Si, the somewhat Americanized Chinese menu taking its roots in the food of Hong Kong but spreading across hundreds of items including a few, like the sweet Congee, that servers will frankly tell patrons *not* to order, it is with Hot Tea (that is also used to wipe down tabletops) already present that diners are handed menus, Tap Water refilled intermittently on request with a few additional Sodas and softdrinks also available. Mostly English friendly, a necessity thankfully recognized by ownership as no effort has been made to detail dishes on the menu - the famous xiaolongbao still listed as ""Pork Steam Buns"" even though almost everyone calls the Soup Dumplings either that or XLB, it is essentially as if servers already have ""1"" or ""2"" written down as they seat patrons, the former $8.25 and stuffed with Pork plus Crab while the $6.25 version eschews the Crustacean and comes across with a smooth, briny smack thanks to the cloudy Aspic with a surprising amount of shredded Meat mixed in it. Flooding the table with condiments, chopsticks, small cups and eventually food, those ordering past the Dumplings are offered a bevy of options including whole Ducks, various Seafoods and Noodle dishes, the Fried Pork Dumplings taking a wrapper similar in thickness to those of the Soup Dumplings and placing it around ground Sausage with just a bit of spice and serving it with Ginger-infused Soy for dipping. Hoping that a place of such regard would have mastered Kung Pao Chicken, though the Sichuan origin of that dish probably should have raised some second thoughts at a place with Shanghai above its door since the areas are over thirteen hundred miles apart, Joe's version comes with a lot of oil and not much spice, the Vegetables completely eschewed with extra Peanuts filling in alongside the generous plate of cubed slightly overcooked Breast Meat. Doing better by the Pan Fried Noodles, a Shanghai standard that here sees thick, flour lengths first broken and then cooked springy in Dark and Light Soy Sauce plus a bit of Sugar, Joe's Beef is sliced thin and added to the pan late which makes for a unique taste with some bites briny and others meaty, the sautéed Spinach standing in for Bok Choy another odd choice leads to an earthy finish, rather than the more typical bitter."
Ramen had way to much onions... onions cooked in the broth,  scallions, then these fried  shallots. Tasted more like an onion soup than ramen. The noodles are typical prepackaged waxy noodles. Not typical japanese ramen. Not sure what this is. Service is subpar.
Came here for a frds birthday structly for its decor. We were surprised to see so many Asian diners here.  Food was meh ..ok. You can get way better shanghainese food in nyc.  At China blue, you are paying 3xs the price for the same foods and its not for the food or service.  You come here to be in a calmer, more upscale type of Chinese restaurant. Although the staff don't reflect the quality the prices dictate.  Portions are mini size compared to all other shanghainese restaurants... White rice was good though, they use the better white rice.   Would I come back?  Don't think so. ..
This place has the best banh mi around.  I've had the sandwiches at other restaurants/shops before but Joju takes the cake. The menu has a ton of options and on top of that you can customize your order based on your taste preferences.  You can add a runny egg on top or ask for a spicier level of flavor (they have several levels of spicy). The restaurant is relatively small but I'm not complaining since it's in Queens. The sandwiches get served to you in a timely manner and they're super filling once you get your hands on them. My favorite sandwich is the bulgogi!
Good thing i know a guy who knows a guy who dated a girl who knew a guy because we got seated as soon as we walked in !! ..... ok i actually dont know anyone but we got lucky lmao . It doesn't get any better than Grimaldi's pizza , the fresh pizza , fresh toppings my oh my i can't get enough of it !!  When in brooklyn you have to come and experience pizza heaven here , just make sure you come hungry because the small was more tham enough for 3 of us. Only problem is after eating pizza here you'll never enjoy pizza anywhere else so be prepared to say good bye to all the other pizzerias.  The location- beautiful with an amzing view of the city (Manhattan) and the Hudson river and Brooklyn Bridge.  The staff- Aces , the waiter took the time to tell us what his favorite topping combo amd the crowd favorites were and checked on us often to see if we were pleased and or wanted anything else. The price - very inexpensive when you consider the quality,  quantity and location of where you're eating.  Hands down the best pizza !!
This place was amazing! From ambiance, to service, to food, to the drinks, and the cool people in the building. You would have never known this was in the heart of times square (off the beaten path). Ordered the Finding Neverland (nervously) I'm usually a bourbon gal and it was better than it was cute. Who knew? Then I quickly switched over to the great old fashioned. The bartender (shame on me for not remembering his name) made these to purrfection!  Food was really good too. I had a cheese plate with the perfect accoutrements.. I mean the kind that I want to recreate at home while entertaining. The ahi tuna was seared oh so beautifully.  Can't wait to go back.. Good for you, friends, or a date! Hello speakeasy/non-tourist trap/quality food and craft cocktails!
Place was overcrowded on a Thursday night. Crowd looked like young professionals. Kind of a yuppie group of preeps. Drinks were overpriced! Not Worth it. I give two stars because even after the bar reached full capacity the security guard let us in anyway since I told him I was visiting out of town.
I don't know what's the rave about this place. Me and my girlfriends went to Nanking for her birthday and they didn't even have what we wanted. The food wasn't that great I've had better for less. Also, the staff had a lot of attitude.
The weekends are made for brunch and New York is renound for its selection. Buttermilk Channel has a lovely organic brunch spread with many of the items sourced from local farms. I brought a brunch buddy as an excuse to try multiple items. The short rib hash comes with eggs sunny-side up, toast, and organic greens. Also pictured is the fried pork chop and cheddar waffle. We also added an extra side of waffles and bacon, because...bacon. And what better way to top off brunch, than with a classic bloody mary. We then capped off our meal with a warm walnut sticky bun. Brunch spread has a nice selection and so does the cocktail menu. Food was great.
Quality is subpar. The beef noodle soup tastes like a mix of hot water and soy sauce. The noodles are too thick. Pork dumplings are extremely greasy. Condiments are watered down.
Got an extremely sinewy cut of meat. 1/3 of the steak was edible. Will never come back.
Didn't expect much from hotel connected place. Burger was excellent, pasta was great. Love that it wasn't crowded. Feels pretty intimate and there's live music just upstairs from the restaurant. Very not FiDi feel which I loved.
So completely underwhelmed by this place.  Came for weekday brunch at 11:30 and sat on back patio, which was cute but extremely tight.  Ordered iced coffee... it ended up being an overly sweet frappe, not iced coffee at all.  The menu is extremely limited for brunch.  They were out of almond croissants.  I placed an order of a waffle, only to find out that minutes later they were offering lunch (although that menu was not offered to us.)  My waffle was $16 and SO small- literally the size of an Eggo.  Fruit and a big glob of butter were served on the side (all mixed together, which was unappetizing.)  I seriously cannot believe it was $16, and not even good - lukewarm and literally tasted like a freezer waffle.  It was a joke and I cannot believe this place is so popular... in a neighborhood with so many choices, I'll be sure to make a different choice next time.
A quick review about our visit 2 weeks ago. We came in for a late lunch/brunch around 3 pm and both ordered burgers (beef and lamb) plus  their doughnut. I loved my lamb burger. It was juicy and tender, without much unpleasant flavor unique to the lamb meet. The cheesy sauce went well with the meet, but don't put too much on it as it may be too thick and steal the meat flavor. The portion was okay since it came with fried/baked (?) potatoes, although they were too greasy. Their cake doughnut was good, too, but not impressive for the price tag.  They were out of the Kale cocktail, so we changed to BLT Mary, but it turned out to be Bloody Mary with a stick of lettuce and bacon, which was different from my expectation (I'm really adventurous).  Overall, the service and food were on point and our server was really sweet. Would go back if passing by.
Good for Instagram but not for taste buds -- that sums up my experience here. On the bright side, this is a fun place. The vibes are good, the decor is cool, and the dishes are a treat for the eyes -- our brunch plates featured banchan of all shapes and colors, such as pink mashed potatoes and a vibrant yellow deep-fried egg. But the food has some real issues when it comes to actual eating -- mackerel was overcooked, salad greens were wilted, and most of the banchan were of middling quality, from the bland kimchi to the Reser's-style slaw. At $20 per plate for brunch, those issues become star-deducting problems.
Visiting NYC once again and having lived in Japan for a year with this o many visits to ramen restaurants, I have brought my wife and couple of friends to this joint. I ordered the original chicken Paitan and my wife ordered the extra spicy miso paitan. The both is very thick here...!!! Probably the thickiest broth I had in my life and I'd say I have about 100 ramen under my belt including the ones I had in Japan, toronto and seoul. Considering how thick the broth is, it is very flavourless in my first spoonful of soup. 2nd spoonful, it is better, few slurps of noodles, meh... noodles were more like Lo mein noodles and not the ramen noodles for me while my wife's was proper ramen noodle. Now where things went a little south for us is on the service side. From the hostess to the servers to the bus staff, we just did not feel welcomed at all.. Grape Chu hi tasting like a Virgin drink and having to explain the drink not tasting any alcohol resulted in semi hostile situation while we were still eating dinner, The bus staff came to take our bowls away.. I felt passionately inclined to give my generous 2 star to this place and will likely never return again.  Totto ramen, good luck!
This place was sooo good especially for last minute late night bite. It wasn't busy I'm pretty sure because it was a Sunday night. The star was great even offered free doughnuts! We recommend getting the hot sauce on the side because it's a lot they put on there. We also had the coke and wine drink rich was pretty good I forget what's it called but it starts with a K. It stays open until midnight on Sunday's too for those of you who need a quick meal!
A true Italian gem where the managers care about their customers from start to finish. Cheese and hams are imported, so delicious!!!
For two weeks, I actually lived in an Airbnb that was directly above this restaurant. Tbh at first, I never wanted to step into this place. It looks pretty sketchy from the outside (window glass was cracked) and pretty non-classy in the inside. I finally went at the suggestion of a friend, who likened this place to a late night spot that we used to go to in college. I must say, my experience here was a very pleasant surprise.  First off, the server / bartender is incredibly fun and welcoming, making friends with everyone in the restaurant. He came around pouring everyone shots! Second, we ordered a sausage fried rice, and it was DELICIOUS. It wasn't the typical fried rice you would expect from a Chinese restaurant, it might have actually been better. There were little crispy bits in the dish that made it chewy, yet crispy at the same time. I thoroughly enjoyed the dish and wished it came in a bigger portion.
I have been coming here for quite some time now and I have go to say, the food is sooo good.  The soup dumplings, the beef scallion pancakes, the noodles, fried dumplings, I've had it all! The thing I will never understand is why the service is soo bad.  If they were to work on their service I would give them 5 stars.   Tip: they only take cash *Oh! I forgot to add that I couldn't order a drink because they had no clean cups. Absolutely unheard of!
I've been here a couple times and this has nothing to do with the pasta itself because I do enjoy it but I found a hair in my pasta!!  I scraped it to the side of my plate to show them. I asked for a new one since I only had one bite. When they brought me a new plate it was clear they took out the hair that I pulled to the side to show them and they just put the same pasta on a different plate and it was not even the plate they usually serve pasta in, but a bigger flat plate.  I saw them do it and they handed me the same pasta that had the hair in the sauce dumped on a new plate. I was pretty annoyed where I didn't even want to ask again because they clearly didn't understand what I asked for the first time. I hope something like this doesn't happen again if there even is a next time...
"Well pros are that the food was decent and the decor was ok.. Firstly, if you come with a child or more than 3 people, expect zero accommodations. They have no high chairs; fine. They also have no booster seats. They also didn't accommodate any sort of booth seating because they said ""all of them"" were reserved. After being seated at a bench we watched TWO people get seated in a 5 seater booth. They did not have a reservation. We also watched as the other booth tables sat empty for our entire meal.  Now on to the fact that our food took forever. We watched every other table in the room get served before us, including tables who were seated after us, with just as many people and when our food did eventually come they could not accommodate the request to have no red pepper in the avocado served on toast. They told us ""it's made that way"". Avocados don't normally grow with red pepper inside of them, so that was ridiculous. Also we asked because of a food allergy...for a 2 year old.  The waitress was sweet, but the hostesses were clueless. Not a place to go with more than 2 people. Decent food, but not the best. You can definitely find a more accommodating establishment on the upper east side with better food and I'm SURE much better customer service."
What strikes me every time I've dined here is that almost everyone is smiling. This is fine dining at high prices, but it's not stuffy or serious. People come here to celebrate and have a good time. The conviviality is especially evident in the tavern. The service is so friendly and professional, which certainly helps. Our dinner wasn't the best we've had here -- the cavatelli, pea shoots and cheese plate were all great but the sour of the sour cream dominagted the sundae -- but it was still a very happy occasion.
So glad that they re-opened after a month of renovation just before we arrived in NY. Momofuku was not in our itinerary, but OMG it was the best coincidence ever to pass by the restaurant and see the menu.  The Niman Ranch dry-aged rib-eye was the thing that caught our eyes and pulled us into the restaurant. Luckily, they could seat us quickly without any reservation. We ordered just the rib-eye because that wonderful thing costs $179. Don't let that high number frighten you because it was worth it, so worth it.  The head chef (bless you) gave us a free appetizer on the house: edamame dip with baby anchovies and chive pancakes. We never knew that edamame can taste this good until tasting this green plate of deliciousness. We almost ordered another one, but kept our control to save our bellies for the main show: the rib-eye!  No words can describe how perfectly cooked and seasoned that piece of meat was. Even the garlic and onion tasted amazing. If you had ever been to NY and didn't eat this then you have made the biggest mistake of your life. For two nights in a row, Momofuku had closed the nights spectacularly with this steak and the crack pie the night before. Bravo!
What have these people never heard of salt?  Also cash only after 2 years is kind of ridiculous.  Bi im bop was tasteless.  I was persuaded to choose the $2 extra hot bowl for crispy rice. Bad move on my part. Because this made the bowl and its contents so unbelievably hot that my girlfriend and I couldn't eat our food for 40 minutes. So after burning our mouths trying hard to eat the banal rice bowl after the terrible tasteless and cold sides we had to pay through the teeth for a stomach ache. Thanks dokebi. Never again.
No, no, no....never again. Worst Thai food AND customer service. Ordered calamari and curry puffs for an appetizer along w/ a Thai iced tea and a Thai iced coffee. Drinks didn't come until long after the appetizers and we had to check with the waitress twice about them (they were okay, but definitely had better). Appetizers were good, but not good enough to make up for the rest of our terrible experience. For our main courses, we got 2 chicken pad Thai dishes and one basil chicken fried rice. Basil fried rice came out with shrimp, we got that fixed. Pad Thai looked great, but was literally the worst I've ever tasted ..and I've had it at a few Thai places. Seems like a standard dish that's hard to mess up, right? Wrong. Don't know what was in the sauce but it was SO BAD! Both, my friend and I, took a few bites and couldn't bear the taste so we called the waitress and told her we didn't not like the dish and at this point did not want it remade or care to order anything else. No apology and guess what? Both pad Thai dishes were on the bill when it was brought out. We asked to have them removed since we did not eat the dishes and the response was, that could not be done. After some back and forth, we were told that one had a few more bites eaten so they could only take off one. Really? We paid for the stupid pad Thai for the sake of putting an end to this experience, but will never be back. Never had such a ridiculous experience...
This place was a cute an unexpected find in our walk across the Brooklyn Bridge on a beautiful Saturday morning. I didn't think we would be able to get in any place decent without a reservation, but lucked out. Adorable little neighborhood cafe. Decor was industrial chic/cozy. I ordered eggs in a cloud which was eggs whites whipped up and yolk in the middle. Underneath was a nice slice of grilled ham on top of sourdough bread and grilled spinach on the side. My daughter had the egg on toast and my husband had traditional eggs, bacon breakfast. Everything was great. Food presentation nice, cooked to perfection. Staff was super friendly. Note that this is cash only establishment. Definitely recommend if you're in Dumbo.
Came here on a Sunday afternoon around 3:30 expecting a long wait, but was seated within 10 minutes (2 people). I wish we came with more people because there were so many things on the menu we wanted to try! We ended up with the crab and pork soup dumplings (of course), shen jian bao, chili and pork noodles, shumai, and scallion pancakes. Soup dumplings were amazing - crab taste was very apparent, which I liked but my boyfriend not so much. Skin was perfectly chewy and didn't fall apart super easily.  Shen jian bao were also really good. There was also soup inside, and the meat filling was very flavorful. My favorite part was the crispy bottom of the bun. Scallion pancakes were just okay - too fried and oily for my taste. Shu mai was great. Loved the generous filling of glutinous rice. Chili and beef noodles were nothing special. Wasn't even spicy unfortunately, and the meat had a strange texture. Overall this place was very good and worth a trip app the way out to flushing. Their famous soup dumplings did not disappoint, though some of their other menu items fell a bit short. Also they are cash only so come prepared!
"We arrived at 7:00 PM and asked for a table outside. It wasn't busy, so we were seated immediately. We ordered wine at 7:02 PM, and when the server came back with said wine at 7:05 PM, we ordered chicken tenders. For the next 30 minutes, we were completely ignored. Having other places to be, at 7:35 PM I went inside to tell the server to cancel the chicken and just give us the bill for the wine. She reacted by saying, ""Oh, the chicken fingers,"" and then tried to excuse it by saying that they had just had a large order and hadn't been able to make them yet. At no point in the 30 minutes we waited did she ever come out to reassure us we weren't forgotten. She then tried to get me to sit back down because - amazingly - the chicken fingers were now ready. (Yes, I saw them in the kitchen, ready to go, but the server wasn't doing anything to bring them to us until I prompted her.) After asking once again if we still wanted the chicken tenders, even though I made it clear we really had to leave, she relented and gave me the bill for the wine. The only reason this gets two stars instead of one is that they charged us happy hour prices for the wine despite ordering a few minutes late."
This could have been burger that made you orgasm but the wait was horrible. They closed the larger eating area knowing this place gets super busy. We waited over and hour and they do not take reservations. They make you wait like if it was a club you regret waiting. By the time we try to go to another place it was too late to go to any restaurants. If I wanted to wait an HR to get to a place I would go to an actual club!!!  PS: the food is not that good, better go to Bearburger. It's about the same and the prices are less.
Thank goodness for yelp!! I was going to see a show in the theatre district so I wanted to find something close by. I yelped surrounding places to eat and this place popped up. My friends and I were so glad that we decided to try Burger and Lobster. The food is delicious!!! I mean, D E L I C I O U S. There were five of us and everyone was happy. I'm a pescatarian and my friends are Carnivores lol. Perfect place for my group. I had the Poi Boy lobster and shrimp sandwich, another friend had a 1 pound lobster, and everyone else had juicy looking burgers. WE ALL LOVED IT!!!
"This place is kinda overrated. A lot of people seem to like this place a lot because it offers a slightly uncommon Chinese food item at rock bottom prices. Indeed, in this regard this place is excellent, so let me start with the good:  Sun Hing Lung (SHL) principally sells rice rolls (腸粉), spelt either ""chang-fun"" in Mandarin, or  ""cheung fun"" in Cantonese; they also sell some rice noodles which I've never tried, along with soy bean milk. It is in a sort of convenient spot, one block away from the major E. Broadway intersection, and pretty easily accessible to most people looking to get here. It's next to a bunch of residences as well, which is cool because it seems to never get too crowded. The prices offered here are also to be lauded. While Chinatown is already known for being something of a bargain, SHL offers very low prices for what is an acceptable breakfast meal. The service is quick, and the people who run the stall are nice enough. While the hours could be a little longer, opening at 7:30 AM is not bad. There are negatives however. The first is that despite being only $1-2, the offerings of different kind of rice rolls via the kind of meat/ meat flavor, there is virtually 0 meat in them. Again, kind of understandable because of the price, but the amount that is in it is kind of silly, and almost makes it pointless. In addition, they don't wrap the meat (beef, pork, chicken, etc) in the rice roll itself, which is what normal places do. Instead, they sprinkle a paltry amount on top of the rice roll, which is kind of lazy. What this means is that it's kind of more similar to a plain rice roll with a tiny bit of meat on the side. The soy bean milk service is also kind of bad. When I went in the middle of the day, when I ordered the soymilk, they asked me if it was alright if it wasn't hot, despite the fact that I ordered a hot one. This is because they only boil it once in the morning, and then don't heat it any further for the rest of the day, resulting in my room temperature soy milk- not what I wanted in 30 degree weather. So... if you want a hot soymilk, better come soon after this place opens. Kind of a shitty reality. People seem to be enamored by the prices and the hole in the walliness of this place, but the reality is this place is only ok, and for slightly higher prices, you can get much better rice rolls to go at Hop Shing, or if you're looking for a sit down experience, at Jing Fong."
"This place was whatever. I think more for tourists and the ""business"" crowd if you ask me. We tried having a late dinner at another spot a few blocks away, but their kitchen was closed, so they recommended Park Avenue Tavern. Me and the young lady shared the following: Meatballs $13 Humus $11 Mussels & Fries $19 The meatballs were ok but nothing special. But everything else was not good at all. The food didn't taste fresh and was missing some basic ingredients and flavor.  They do have a full bar and the cocktails were decent."
Everyone's heard of Grimaldi's, but I had never thought of going out of my way to try it. Well, my mom was visiting from out of town so I decided to take her on a walk across the Brooklyn bridge and then have Grimaldi's.  At 2pm on a weekday, there was still a bit of a line. We ended up waiting around 30 mins, and when we were finally ushered in, we were seated on the 2nd floor. The decor is simple and all the utensils and plates were paper/plastic.  We added mushrooms to a large original, which already comes with tomato, basil and cheese. It was good- hot, juicy and flavorful. The bill for a large pizza and cappuccino came to $30. Considering the wait, price, and experience (paper plates, plastic forks and knives) I'm not sure I would go back again.
Very over priced for the portion and quality. Was served what smelled to be spoiled soup. Server was gracious and immediately replaced. Very good wait stuff I must stay. However, much better alternatives available.
yuck, the worst korean food anywhere - and completely inept service (had to wait for bill for 10 minutes after asking twice)  every dish was terrible, how on earth does this place not have 2 stars?  have these people had korean before - cherry on top the wagyu was not real wagyu
"Disclaimer: Rafael is amazing, and whatever this failing establishment can do to keep him, they should do. And then some. Arrived at 8:45 on a Friday, immediately seated. Ordered a drink and a mezze plate ($17). Drinks came in 10-15. Mezze took a long time, and when it arrived it was sad. Fast forward an hour, nobody stopped to take our dinner order or, at minimum, our second drink order.  The octopus was okay, although the ""aioli"" was mayonnaise. And it was served with potatoes? Bizarre. Apparently the quinoa was good if you are into that kind of thing.  Anyway, our waiter kept saying ""sorry the kitchen was backed up"" when he dropped things off and then would proceed to not come back for 30-45 minutes. This is Rintintin, not Vandal. blah."
Just dined here tonight.  The restaurant is Cash Only, but they have an ATM near the restroom.  The ambience was rustic and nice.  The space was used nicely, I didn't feel cluttered.   We ordered two cocktails, one app, one salad, and two entrees.  We ordered two special dishes, the Orecchiette with Pork Ribs and the Papardelle with a Ground Lamb and Olive Ragu.  The Orecchiette was amazing and the ribs were soft and delicious, the best dish of the night.  The pasta of the Papardelle was great, but the dish was in need of something extra.  All the dishes were tasty and fresh and we would gladly come back here. Suggested dishes: Italian Lemonade Meatballs Beet & Arugula Salad Orecchiette
EVERYTHING we ordered was amazing. All great flavors and the group of four of us ate every last bite.    I don't typically order fruity drinks but the cocktail I ordered off of their specialty drinks menu was good. I ordered the Flunk Flink.  I suggest you try it or one of the specialty cocktails just because you can.  One more thing... this might be weird but.... if you order your cocktail at the bar, close your tab and make sure to immediately tell the host you closed your tab so that they can seat you right away.
I ordered the linguini monsignore and it was great. Also the house bread was warm and toasty. The food I thought was 5 stars. The atmosphere was typical Italian which was nice. The service could be improved which is why I don't give it a 5 stars.
"If I were solely rating this restaurant for the food, I would give it 5 stars hands down. But because of the service, I'd have to give our most recent experience a 2. My husband and I came to have our anniversary dinner here. While the food was delicious, we felt that the waitstaff was being disingenuous by not making us aware that we were being charged for bread. After being seated and taking our drink order, our waiter nonchalantly asked ""would you like to start off with our house-made bread?"" without mention of cost. Some time after our appetizers arrived, another waitstaff asked if we ""wanted more bread?"" to which we agreed because the bread was really good! But then to have this offering be added to our bill (twice) without our knowledge seems out of character with a fine dining restaurant like Print. I did not bring this to the attention of our waiter at the time as I did not want to ruin our night.  Additionally we were ignored by the restaurant manager all night. He had very friendly interactions with the guests, milling around asking if everything was alright, and to go so far as to visit the table behind us, not once but twice to pour them wine; so it did not go unnoticed that he avoided our table. I am terribly disappointed with Print's service and even more so at their lack of response to my direct messages.  tl;dr Get the bread but despite the waiters' implication, it's not complimentary."
Just need to weigh in here. It's a great dive bar with great pub grub-- but it's not really a BBQ restaurant. It's a little junky funky red hook, very relaxed, very accommodating staff. Good beer selection, fun industrial hack garden seating (no views, hot as hell). The food BBQ consisted of pulled pork sliders, chicken tacos and wings - no brisket, no ribs, etc. It tasted good but could have been better -- the best thing is the price tag. This is why there is a 4.5 star rating. Ice house, take note: if you raise your prices, your rating will quickly decline!! Solid 3 stars as a restaurant  Solid 4-5 as a bar
"I admit, I was disappointed with this place before I even ate there. Its space used to house both a local hardware store and a family run cafe called the Graffiti Room ( ) which supported artist installations and seemed like it was just getting it's legs under it before both businesses were shuttered their doors. I wanted to try the food though to give it a chance as most of the other Italian restaurants in the area are either over-priced or tourist traps (or both). We had the Caesar Salad, Campanelle Pesto, and the Pancetta Panini. While the pasta was cooked well, the pesto sauce was pretty heavy and was a little bland honestly. The salad was a passable Caesar. The panini was by far the best thing we ordered. Really good flavor from the caramelized onion and pancetta jam with a good slab of mozzarella served nice and hot. If everything else was as good as the sandwich, this review would probably get a couple extra stars. To make matters worse, the portions are very small. So while the dishes are more affordable, you may end up having to get multiple to fill yourself up. If the food were better, I'd feel a bit better about it replacing 2 other mom-and-pop businesses. Instead, this is just another example of pieces of the community being erased to make room for another faceless business which seems to be designed with instagram in mind at all times. If you're all about making new food posts from trendy new shops, you'll probably love it. If you're looking for good food or calling spaghetti carbonara ""Breakfast Spaghetti"" makes your eyes roll, you should head somewhere else."
This place is swinging and now I understand why.. it's a nice dinner with outstanding service.  We started at 9:30 pm and we left at midnight.. the waitress and wait staff was awesome. We went for the three course dinner menu which seemed like the right amount of food for our table of 9. I started with the scallops with fresh corn which was delicious.  Highly recommend that. Had one of the fish with mussels and green foam which was good. Ended with cheese plate which I would urge you to get the stinky cheese. Bill ended up being $200.  This place isn't for the faint heart.
So lucky to have been seated right away ... right after the kinky boots show on a wed. Night ... we did apps only and cocktails  the kinky boots cocktail was okay (not great), apps: guac (very flavorful), shrimp flatbread (cheesy- cheese lovers this is for you), shrimp mini tacos (outstanding), chicken fingers (very good) ... would def go back
2 weeks ago I had a pretty tough time & I decided to walk into this bar at random, twice. Monday & Sunday nights were pretty slow but the business was at a perfect pace for me to get my thoughts together. Ray, manager and bartenders Ben, Craig, & Lucy were phenomenal! They were extremely engaging and knowledgeable with their respective crafts. I loved the chill vibe and the location. Parking is a bit of a challenge? But within 5 minutes I was able to find something. I would definitely recommend checking out this location ( I will update my review once I try the food)
This spot is just an example of what bushwick is turning into a hipster spot. Burger was ok fries was about average with there hot spicy sauce  and beer was average prices. Cool ping pond table a lot of space to in enjoy a summer night with friends
I would give the drinks at this place a 5, while the food was just mediocre. It is definitely a good place to visit for the well crafted fancy cocktails, however the drinks were a little too expensive ($13) for me to be visiting this place again.  I was a little disappointed that the list of cocktails only contained about 10 drinks. The cocktails I had (Willy Wonka and Finding Neverland) were strong and perfectly blended, yet I can still taste the distinct flavors that were described.  poutine fries - The fries were super crispy even at the end it did not get oily or soggy. I loved that the cheese was melted parmesan instead of the cheese curds. The gravy is also very light and thin, it was not too overpowering but gave it the right flavor. brisket sliders- I did not like this at all from the bread to the brisket. The bread was too heavy for the brisket. The brisket itself was dry and the barbecue sauce on it was too sweet and overwhelming.
"The best word for Heidi's is ""cozy"". It's a small joint - but lovely for a bit of an UES change of scenery."
"Came to this place on a recent trip to New York with my wife. I had contacted the manager about reserving a table as early as possible, to which we were advised there were no reservations available, but that she would try and accommodate us as walk-ins. I advised her that we would be coming from an extensive hike around the city and would not be dressed too formal, to which she told  us they would provide me with a suit jacket and that the rest of our attire was appropriate.  Upon our arrival at 5 pm, when the restaurant opened (no other clients at all) I had told the hostess I spoke with the manager, to which she phoned her seeking confirmation, letting her know condescendingly  that ""that couple"" had just arrived. Upon getting confirmation she proceeded to escort me to a table and pull up the menu telling me "" you are aware the expense of this meal? Just wanted to show you the menu."" I was fully aware of the dining experience here, read about it, and I wanted us to eat by the water with a view of downtown and the Brooklyn bridge. My wife and I on several occassions have eaten at places of this nature, but never have we felt so embarrassed and belittled. The hostess was judgemental of our presence, so I pretty much told her she was disrespectful and rude. We were so disgusted by our initial greeting we decided to walk out. Never did we sit down, never did we try the food. I pray there dining isnt as terrible as their treatment of guest."
I love eating the oxtail noodles here and chrysanthemum chilled tea (the tea is pre-prepared in the fridge, so no ice)...though the noodles are a little bit oily maybe a lot oily (perhaps because I am eating oxtail), the food is super delicious, so tasty and filling and flavorful the spices and the spicy oil and the smooth and soft noodles and tender meat textures just blend together so well (it's like a party in my mouth) and if I could eat and have leftovers to take home, I could definitely put that oxtail over rice, but I always eat it up real fast because there's always a line of people and some hoping to have the chance to eat their food right away (when the noodles taste their optimal best!!...there is limited seating, just 2 small counters and seats/stools running along the back side walls, so you'll sit side by side with whoever you're eating with (good for sharing if you're into that or not greedy with your food) ...after waiting on that decent sized line...a lot of people eat here...for reasonably cheap prices and great tasting food....then again you can take out and take a walk down by the park and eat on a bench or on the grass...riverside drive is just 2 blocks away around the corner....so enjoy the flavorful experience at xians, I'm sure everything else on the menu tastes just as good...there are a lot of local regulars that come to eat here...they have salad and soup noodles and burgers too, I've only had small tastes of those, which were all pretty tasty too...definitely you should come and try it out at least once...(my Chinese friend told me they don't have butter in China, so they use oil for their noodles...TTFN (ta ta for now) until the next food adventure  P.S. Eat the food while it's hot and fresh...
I came here for my birthday dinner with friends yesterday, and even though the food was good, unfortunately the service was crap. Our server was a grumpy older guy called Giovanni who NEVER smiled, he was grumpy, impatient and cold. I even had to speak to him about it, before he tried to force a smile.  Now to the food, the bread was amazing, we had the east and west cost oysters, those were really good, then I had the spicy tuna tartare and then the Chilean sea bass and that my dear friends, was phenomenal. Table service was really bad as we had to constantly look for our waiters and ask for the table to be cleaned. Finally in attempt to make me feel happy maybe? They brought me the worst make believe cake I've ever seen. Terrible!  Food was great, but I won't be returning based on the service.
I haven't had a lot of Cuban food, but this is by far the best Cuban food I've ever had!! Café Habana is a cute little hole in the wall near Soho. It's kind of small so seating is limited, but when we came on a Tuesday night around 6:30p.m. we were seated immediately. The table was really small and felt kind of cramped, but it didn't bother us that much since the food was sooo good!! Our waiter was super nice and provided excellent service. She was full of energy and made the experience eating here that much better.  Guava Limeade- it was very refreshing and wasn't overly sweet, which is why I really liked it.  Grilled Corn (Elote)- OMG, the grilled corn here is the BOMB!!! Don't leave without getting it. They are very generous with their portions. It came with 2 huge pieces of corn and was seasoned to perfection.  Roast Pork- the pork is super tender and packed with lots of flavor. It was served with rice and beans, which were also really good. I can't wait to go back and order this dish again!  Plantains- I also ordered a side of plantains and they were the perfect accompaniment to my meal. It added the perfect amount of subtle sweetness to my meal.
Honestly I was very disappointed. I had high expectations based on reviews but the service was very poor. I am not going to lie and say the food was bad because we thought the appetizers were good and the entrees were mediocre. From stepping in the door, we were given attitude. No water refills unless we asked. Waiter never checked on us once. Then there was an issue with credit card processing. Not worth the hype.
Just a heads up, this restaurant is believably huge by Manhattan standards in terms of square footage. I would have given a five star rating a year ago, but they've added a lot more options to the menu. This isn't a bad thing, but it was an odd way to mask the fact that prices were going up. I'd recommend sticking to their classics, even if it costs a few bucks more, because that's what got them famous in the first place. You really can't go wrong here. I've had various lobster rolls here, and I always marvel at how buttery and toasty the rolls are, and how fresh the lobster tastes. I appreciate that they don't drown the lobster in the sauce so that you have ample ability to taste both. Fries are always nice and crisp, and the side salad is always refreshing. Service here is also amazing in general. Despite the large size of the restaurant and the noisiness, the serving staff is super friendly and makes an effort to ensure that you have a great experience.
As you initially walk in you think it's going to be a good place to hang out in and have a tasty meal but it was pretty disappointing. I was trying hard to find something really positive to say but the only good thing is that the place looks very cool inside. The service from the waiter we got was bad, probably because he was kinda spacey and inexperienced. The food was simply bad. We ordered the ribs and the brisket. I really hope these guys get their act together because thie place has good potential.
Every second Tuesday of each month, this Shake Shack location coordinates a Shack and Track event at 7 pm. The employees hold your bags for you while you run with the rest of the group. I've been on two of these runs, left my bag with them and everything was fine. On October 11, 2016, a new employee did the bag check for the first time. After I came back from the run, my bag was opened and all of my cash was stolen from my wallet. This employee claimed that he locked up all of our bags securely and no one should've been able to access them. The money obviously didn't just disappear on its own, someone clearly stole them. If you choose to participate in their Shack and Track events, be aware of your belongings.
Try their chef testing menu. It's $50/person. I was a bit worry that they will turn out bad cause they don't have a set menu for that so you will never know what you'll get, but the waiter said we can request a thing or two. After went through the menu, we decided to go with the chef testing menu and we requested to have their foie gras and no pasta. Below the list what we tried and comments (not in order they arrived): 1. soup on the house, you will get it even though you don't order the testing menu ** I think it was ok 2. salad with apricot and bacon, I think this is the first item on their menu ** LOVE IT 3. tuna tartar with eggplant ** I hate eggplant and this is the first time I can say I love eggplant. Good job chef! 4. scallops ** just perfect 5. baby back ribs ** the sauce was too sweet for me, it's a no no 6. sweet bread ** amazing 7. pork belly ** eeeh it was ok it has blue cheese ~ I don't like blue cheese 8. foie gras with sunny side up egg ** interesting mix, not my favorite but it was good 9. shrimp ** so flavorful so yummy 10. sliders short rib ** ahhhh they just melt in your mouth. delicious! 11. penne cotta ** too sour and too milky for me 12. bacon donut with coffee ice cream and more bacon ** THIS IS THE BOMB! I can't get enough of it 13. strawberry ** very nice touch to close up the whole experience  I didn't take any picture cause we were too busy eating and drinking. If you could get a table in the back I think is better more quite. The only thing I wish they could do better was the baby back ribs. I suggested them to add chili seeds or something spicy to bring the flavor and bring a kick to it. Otherwise it was waaaaay to sweet.
Went here for our anniversary dinner and the place did not disappoint! The kimchi paella, the Mac and cheese and the steak were delicious! Although they don't take reservations, we went on a Wednesday at 7pm and were able to get seated in 15 minutes.
Over 2000 reviews must be good, and indeed it was.  SF Bay Area just recently opened din Tai fung which is totally legit, I only Been to the one in Seattle and they call it juicy dumplings, they juicy.  At Nan Xiang, they are a little wider and slightly thicker on the skin.  The broth and pork filling was absolutely Devine.  Probably best meal of the week in NYC.  Had both pork and one with crab pork.  Green onion pancake, simple but chewy oily good flavor.  Hot soy milk, legit.  Handmade dumplings clean.  stir fried rice cakes perfect as well. Came on a Thursday at noon, no wait but place was full in minutes with people waiting.   This area of flushing is the real deal Chinatown of America, everything is good here.
Can't wait in line forever? Get take out!! Best dishes are Ratchaburi crab and roast pork dry noodles for entree and pumpkin custard with sticky rice for dessert!  These are a few of my favorite things!
I rather go to the Puerto Rican conner place called ''BORICA'' lol its more honest and different! Nowadays typical spot taking over Ridgewood, nothing special..exciting, same type of people u see in Williamsburg .   Mister Sunday might the only exciting thing about this place  !  Its worthy MAYBE  if you already live in Ridgewood . Traveling to go to a  ''beer garden'' not exciting...
Good food, good drinks. No wait, because we decided to sit at the bar after been told there was a 15-20 minute wait for tables by the hostess. Saw a few empty tables for a long time while enjoying ourselves at the bar. Hope the manager is aware of this issue and micromanage the seating of guests into the empty tables if necessary.
This place was a complete nightmare and will never return again. My server talked the people at other table for good hr and time my food came it was cold and dry. She honestly needs learn be server and not chat 24/7. Please fire this women the service was a nightmare for us and other tables at this restaurant.
We came here for brunch. Modern yet classy atmosphere. Food was meh. My fiancée tried the burger which looked really good but was just your average burger and lacked flavor. I took the semi light route and got the quiche. The texture was mushy. Almost like the quiche should have stayed in the oven for another five minutes. Bloody Mary.... don't even bother. If it was made in house please stop making it because sucks. Watered down and had no flavor. Overall, the restaurant looked really nice but the food was OK. Pass.
We had a great time here at Mom's Kitchen! The food was delicious, came out promptly and was hot and fresh.  Christie was our waitress and she was awesome with suggestions on what to order and super sweet!  Also Dylan came by our table and chatted with us as well, and he was so friendly about all things New York, as we were there vacationing!  Try this restaurant, you won't be disappointed!
Place came highly recommended and didn't disappoint. Started off with the cheese which was good but very small. Then, while a lot of the appetizers looked good decided to try the beet salad. Was amazing. Combination with strawberries and goat cheese was awesome.  We then did their special pasta for the day which was a tortellini with blue crab. Then had chorizo and other things in sauce. Also, had the  orecchiette which was very savory. Along with great food, awesome wine list and helpful if you know the wine regions of Italy. Overall, food amazing l, service great, and all for a very reasonable price for NYC
Went with my girl and between us both we ordered 6 tacos, 2 drinks and 2 corn on the cob.  It should not cost $70. Not going back.
Very busy joint! The pearl noodles, roti, and curry beef were good. The fried fish casserole wasn't good. It consisted of soggy fried fish cooked in a sauce and veggies. Check out Yelp reviews for food suggestions. Service was ok...
I couldn't believe I haven't written a review already for this place! It's my fav fried chicken place in NY. Root & Bone and Red Rooster have to got back in line after I learned about this place. Yes, it's not in a great neighborhood, and there's nowhere you can linger around for an-hour wait for a table. But it's all worth it after you tried their fried chicken and their fried grits!  I eat pretty spicy. But I still found it very spicy with the hot option. So be careful.  Also this is Nashville style, so a lot of crispy breading should be expected.
Always my go to soup dumpling place! I love the soup dumpling here. Definitely underrated compared to Joe's Shanghai. The food always comes out very fast and the service could be better but not bad either.
I cannot believe how big and crowded this place was. Even though the restaurant and bar were visibly packed, they were able to seat us right away. I remember when the hostess was walking us to our seats and we went through crowds and different rooms to get to the area we sat in. We ended up at a communal table, basically, with like 12 tables for 2 people each all in a row spaced out by a few inches. I felt like I was having dinner with strangers just due to proximity, rather than what could have been a romantic date since the ambiance is lovely, candle-lit. I was also surprised by the crowd of people considering it was a Thursday... it appeared to be a very hopping happy hour place, but without happy hour specials :( Disappointing but I suppose not surprising since it's Midtown.  On to the good things... the cocktail menu is like an encyclopedia which is pretty cool you can really find something based on the liquor you are looking for. The food, even better. I got mac and cheese with the add in pork, which was delicious in itself and tons of flavor. But, bonus! Onion rings on top. And then the onion rings were not actually onion rings, because they had mac and cheese inside them!?!? It was an amazing surprise. My husband loves his tacos too. And for the grand finale.. we had to get the sticky toffee pudding because we've only had it once before at a different restaurant and knew it'd be amazing. It's the perfect sweet sugary treat to end a great meal. If this place had happy hour specials and was less crowded, I'd be more inclined to come back, but if I'm in the area again I definitely would still recommend this place for good food and a young vibe.
I came to the Bloody Mary festival and was very excited to get a fried chicken sandwich. I was told it would be a very long wait and that the festival would be over before more chicken was available. Why was this advertised if they did not have enough chicken????? Terrible service and I will never visit this establishment.
Had a reservation for Sunday afternoon, it was packed and really loud. The mac and cheese is def big enough to split as an app, hot and a good meld of flavors. The Monkey bread was tiny and not that good. I had the breakfast pot pie with scrambled eggs and included a drink, overall it was okay but salty. The smith bar steak was tiny, under-cooked(asked for medium) and covered in fries that seemed to be the end of the batch aka cold and small broken pieces. The decor was good, but the staff was a little inattentiv (our water bottle sat empty for a while).
This place is a meh, overhyped and overpriced! Raman is just so so, a dinner Ramen bowl came with a pittance of 2 small pork belly. There aren't too much Ramen in the bowl either. We ordered the pork belly appetizer and two softshell crabs with the bun in addition to 2 Ramens. One it's the braised short ribs special at $25. My friend liked her Ramen special as the broth from the beef were nice. The pork belly appetizer was covered with thick sauce which did not add anything to the dish. Rather, a distraction that you have to shake out the sauce that was too overpowering. The softshell crab is decent was the crab is pretty small too. After I spend $80 later with no drinks for two people I am still not full!
Came here for our monthly friends dinner get together. Note they do take reservations of 5 or more but all people have to be present to be seated. They are kind of strict on this and you have to call them to confirm day of as well. It's a small place but service was very good. Items ordered. Cheese Fondue, didn't stand out and not too many dipping items just apples, bread, bread sticks, and potato wedges with bacon. Definitely could of had more items for the fondue. I'd skip it. The fried oysters is a must have crisp, not soggy and had a great veggie sauce underneath. Bone Marrow is probably the item to get and comes with all the fixins. A great onion marmalade, sea salt, brioche bread and huge bones filled with marrow. Mains. Fried Chicken wasn't a standout and to me the honey over flavored everything. The catfish and sea bass were the items to get. Also the sides of collards was a must have.
Really yummy food! Got the lobster Benedict and the French toast. Both Delish! Super friendly and nice hostess and waitress too. It's a bit cramped/crowded but worth it overall!
I liked this place because 1. no line 2. quick service 3. tasty ramen for the price one pays.  I was told by my companion that this place was a little more hidden and obscure, but solid food. He was right. I immensely enjoyed my Shoyu ramen... and being the pig I am, I naturally had some (most?) of the fried chicken companion ordered. That fried chicken though. Delish. Do yourself a favor and try. It's to die for.
Their happy hour is between 5-7pm. They don't take reservation but if you're a party or just 2, the wait isn't that long.  They have a deal where you get either 6 clams OR 6 oysters + Merlot or Chardonnay for 9$. ( otherwise they're each $1.25) They lack staff but those that were present were very attentive and nice. I didn't order anything else besides oysters and clams but the food that people around me ordered looked amazing!   Their oysters taste pretty fresh, but some of their clams are small and not Juicy!
We went to Atera for a friend's birthday. Based on high review and profile, we expected to have a 5 star dinner.  However, miserably failed. 1. Over priced. For what were served that night, didn't worth $400 per person. I wasn't sure where the all inclusive drinks and tip for $150 from other viewer, we were charged much higher than that.  2. Don't be late and have your friend starts without you or you will be ripped off.  I was late due to work unexpectedly. The restaurant didn't make up about 4 courses I missed which we still have to pay for it. 3. The food is only OK.  With all these great reviews, we expected much tastier courses. But, I honestly don't have a memorable dish for suggestion. All I can remember is the Squid noodle was way too chewy and dishes were made with some typeof animal fat (as we were told). Just weird to hear it so many times.  4. Boring desserts. We had total 4 desserts. 3 were made with ice cream, on a snowy and cold day. But have to say, chocolate was pretty good. Overall, not worth going back, or going at all...
The rendang wasn't horrible in flavor, but I was disappointed by its quantity/cost ratio. There was so little of the rendang itself that I thought I had ordered an appetizer at first. I won't be retuning.
"A Cantonese friend recommended to tried the place since Shanghai manor was so packed next door and we were hungry. Tried their HK style wonton noodle soup, their noodle is made in the house, very special texture, thin but ""crunchy""!  Each wonton consist of a shrimp and pork.  The wonton skin is not overlooked like other places.  Tried their congee as well, much more authentic have and traditional ingredients and flavor. I would say this is good place to have a quick lunch for a bowl noodle soup or congee."
Chinatown is the last place you'd expect to find a good taco place. That novelty alone sets Breakroom apart from all the other neighboring Chinese restaurants that normally crowd this neighborhood. The second and most important reason is of course that they make really delicious tacos!! They also offer burgers, sandwiches and fries but TRUST ME you want to get the tacos when you come here. I ordered their special 3 taco platter, where you can pick any combination of meat taco you want out of the 3. I decided that I wanted all 3 of them to be fish tacos, since I've seen the rave reviews for them here from my fellow Yelpers. I also ordered a large side of guacamole. One shortcoming of Breakroom is that they only have one person behind the counter, and just a handful of cooks. This of course leads to somewhat slow service and orders getting backed up. Nonetheless, when my fish tacos finally came my mouth was watering! The fish is generously fried to a light crispy crust, and they add tomatoes, onions and shredded lettuce to the rest of the taco. I of course needed to request a large side of guacamole, because no taco is completely with a large dollop of avocado goodness!
Okay why is this place so hyped because it definitely could do a lot better. I'm not down for overpriced Asian food that has been Americanized... it's not authentic! I didn't bother with the ramen here and only tried the pork buns. The only thing these $13 pork buns got going on for them is that the meat is quality. Helloooo where's the sauce? I want to get lost in it! The buns aren't even made like they're from heaven. If you're going to charge that much then it better be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. These buns- regular. This place was not worth the hype and you won't be getting full for how much you're paying. Go somewhere else! (Also because there's usually a wait which is really annoying) Although there is a bathroom (also with a line) if you need to go~
My BF hasn't tried this place, so we decided to come here. Sadly, we both had a TERRIBLE experience with the food.  We ordered sliders, risotto, market salad, and polenta. The best part about the meal was the polenta. The market salad was good, fresh, but small.  The solders didn't have any sauce. We asked the waitress who said it was extra for more sauce, and we had to lift the piece of bread up to show her there wasn't any sauce. So she takes the sliders back to the kitchen, instead of just bringing extra sauce, cause both of our sliders lacked sauce. Idk why they were being stingy. I didn't bother and just ate my slider dry.  And the RAWsotto was disgusting, it was crunchy, lacked flavor, and was gross, every bite was chalky. It was so bad, we asked for it to be removed from the check, which is a rarity. But yes it was that bad.  I did however enjoy my cocktail. I got a strawberry gin, sorry I forgot the name but that was delicious.  I will not be returning here, with so many good options in NY, avoid this place. Their quality has dropped dramatically and serving raw risotto and sliders with no sauce, just isn't worth coming back.
Travelled across town and arrived an hour before they were supposed to close but we were waved away. Make sure you phone ahead to avoid being disappointed.
After my trip to IKEA, I decided to forgo the amazing meatballs served at IKEA and try Red Hook Lobster. It was a good decision as I was delighted with the service and the atmosphere plus there was no wait time.  I started off with the cheesy lobster fries; the fries were loaded with five different cheeses and it was a melt made in heaven it needed more lobster in it ; none the less it was very good.  My next choice was the Caramelized lobster Brussels sprouts, the Brussels sprouts had a sweet and nice grilled taste - fantastic !!!! My final selection was The Connecticut lobster roll -all I can say is wow the bread was buttery but not soaked with butter and the lobster was coated perfectly not overwhelmed with mayo. I will be back to try the rest of the menu as I'm wide open on Red Hook Lobster .
Overrated and underwhelming given the high price tag and less than mediocre service (I.e., didn't refill bread basket when empty, didn't top off water glasses, poor etiquette when clearing plates). Dishes were good, but none were memorable. Subpar service really rubbed us the wrong way given the hype and cost. Didn't find this to be worth it, would choose lots of other options before considering coming back.
"We randomly happened upon this noodle shop when we were walking through Chinatown. And I do mean happened. It's tucked on the bend of this small street (it's only 200 ft. long), and we just saw it as we were walking by and decided to stop for a bite. There were 5 of us, and we took up half the seating area, and actually another random customer ended up sitting at the same table because space was so limited. Believe the hype, these noodles are crazy good! But, yes, they are greasy. If your stomach gets upset with too much grease, you may want to stay away from this place. While eating them, I was very impressed with their fresh flavor, wishing all the noodles I ate at restaurants tasted that good. The difference is a little staggering. I've made noodles before for a noodle soup, but they still didn't taste as fresh as the noodles here. At any rate, after eating them, I did feel a little queasy from all the grease, but it was still kind of worth it to have tasted a noodle so wonderful. Even the leftover cold noodles were good, because I let them drain a bit on a paper towel. SOME HISTORY ABOUT DOYERS ST There is also some interesting history about Doyers Street, where it's situated. Right next door, you'll find the Nom Wah Tea Parlour which has been open since 1927 (and looks like it). The Post Office used to be a distillery that Hendrik Doyer opened up in the late 1700s, and in the early part of the century, it was the headquarters of a political Chinatown boss named Chuck Connors. From 1893 - 1911, the first Chinese language theater in all of NYC was housed on this street, and eventually turned into a rescue mission for homeless people after it closed. The Chinese Opera House (I've seen it referred to as both The Chinese Opera House and Chinese Theatre) had multiple gang-related murders within the opera's wall--even one happening during a performance when the theatre was packed with hundreds of people.  Eventually it closed in 1910, and subsequently the building was destroyed by a fire. Several fires have occurred here, most with fatalities and serious injuries. Next to where the old opera house was, is the Apothéke, a speakeasy-type cocktail bar. The bend in the street was once referred to as the Bloody Angle due to a large amount of gang violence that even lasted into the 1930s. Because of so many shootings that occurred, more people died violently at the Bloody Angle that any other intersection in the entire USA. I read somewhere that it still hold that record today. There are tunnels located under Doyers, where the ""hatchet boys"" would flee after their completed assignments. They are now home to a barber, hair shops, florists, and even a restaurant. One of the tunnels exits along Bowery Street."
Proud to say, red hook lobster pound popped my lobster roll cherry! The service was awesome, very nice hostess as well as bartenders, the few times I went I sat at the bar. All 3 bartenders I encountered were helpful and very chilled out. Will was the first one that served me, very helpful and knowledgable!  Food was brought out in a very timely manner, the lobster roll was as official as it can get. Nice amount of lobster, chiptole mayo gave it that perfect zing and bacon was cooked to perfection, awesome experience. Also tried the mac and cheese, and I approve!  Selection of beers is perfect.  I will be religiously visiting this place from now on. All the staff seem really nice and hard working! And the food makes the trip worth it! Thank you!
So disappointed with our experience last night.  Been meaning to try this place out for a while - been looking for a new neighbourhood restaurant and being British this place looked ideal.  Bad experience started when I called to inquire about their roast - asked the first person who answered the phone if they were doing a roast today, they didn't reply and passed the phone to someone else, this happened again with the next person. Finally got someone on the line who replied, and after asking several times if they do a roast dinner, they told me they 'don't do anything like that here.' After checking online to make sure I didn't have the wrong place, my partner called back, confirmed that they do indeed do a roast dinner on a Sunday, and booked a table.  When we arrived there was no record of our booking. The decor was gorgeous, music was great - really liked the atmosphere. The wait/bar staff were perfectly nice and did their best, but they were completely understaffed.  We placed our food and drink order quickly. The drinks arrived after the food, so sat for 30mins with no word or update from anyone. The sides arrived after we had already finished our meal, we gave up on the extra gravy we asked for. The roast itself wasn't great - very little gravy, unseasoned boiled new potato's rather than roast or mashed as you would expect, and the yorkshire puddings were more like strange little cakes or muffins.  We had planned to come here on their happy hour nights and check out the whole menu - it might be better on a quieter night, but I just don't think we'll be bothering trying it again. We didn't complain at the time, having worked in the service industry half my life I know it's not the waiters fault and nothing could be done that night, but after spending money (and my partners birthday night) on a useless evening - I needed to vent.
Food: 5/5.  I had the baby shrimp fried rice. It was yummy and I asked them to make it spicy(great idea because it still came out NOT TOO SPICY) very flavorful. And LOTS OF SHRIMP.   Atmosphere: 4/5. It was cold inside, they even stocked up while we were all inside eating. They left the door open for about 3 minutes.  HOWEVER, they seated us quick, brought out food quick, and it's not very noisy inside.  Return chance: 4/5. If I'm in the neighborhood I will definitely come here.  However, I love trying new things.  BUT I believe you should come and try here yourself. It's yummy.
We came here for our first anniversary. It was an amazing experience. We had the squid ink spaghetti with rock shrimp and calabrese sausage. Wow! Next up was beef cheek ravioli with porcini mushrooms. Again, sublime. Finished with the sweetbreads. We finished with an apple tart with ginger and ice cream and banana creme anglais.
Mixed Review.  I've been here twice.  It was OK the first time and pretty great the second time.  Just this past week I had the Butcher BBQ Burger, which is essentially a burger, topped with pulled pork (my choice, the other choice is smoky brisket).  It comes with coleslaw and was really great. We were seated pretty quickly and the servers were really nice both times.  My overall impression is pretty good, but not amazingly great.  Mighty Quinn is better and Hill Country is also better.  But I would certainly return, especially because of the convenient location.
I got food poisoning from their food. I ordered the drunken noodles spicy and it was alright. But when I got home, I felt very sick. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all costs. Save yourself the pain of food poisoning!! The Health Dept. should shut this place down.
I used to live on Staten Island and my favorite thin crust pizza was from this place in my neighborhood, Joe and Pats. I'd have it about once every week or so. Having tried Rubirosa's recently, I think I've found my new favorite thin crust spot! We split the 14 inch tie dye pie(vodka, tomato, pesto, mozzarella) and opted to add mushrooms. The presentation gets two thumbs up -- the toppings were assembled neatly and the colors so vibrant and appetizing. The taste? Incredible! The crust was thin and crisp as a cracker. The tomato sauce tasted so fresh and rich! I'd be satisfied with a pie just with this sauce but the vodka sauce and pesto allowed for different pockets of explosive flavor with each bite. Mmmmm. They skimped on the mushrooms, though. Anyways, I'd order this pie again. I ate 3 slices but could honestly have eaten the whole thing by myself. Thin crust is dangerous!  Only the pizza menu was available during our visit but I'll definitely be back for the rest of the menu -- and more pizzas! -- on a future trip.
Alright, I'm going to be real honest here. The $45 omakase was NOT GOOD, NOT FRESH, NOT even slightly mediocre. I totally get the concept of you get what you pay for so I came in, not expecting anything at all. But the food was very below average. I didn't want to finish the rest of the omakase. The shrimp even tasted fishy and bad. The uni looked like it sat out all day(s)..... I've had my share of cheaper omakase (in the $50-$75 range) and it was far better than this place. Lesson learned, do not cheap out on seafood.
Average food and experience.  Chicken was luke warm and didn't stand out from other Mediterranean restaurants.  Surprised this place is this highly rated.  Spend half the price and get chicken and rice from the Halal Guys or Mamoun's at St. Marks.
"Peaches is an old neighborhood standby for brunch and takeout with decent soul food and spotty service.  Sounds a bit boring? Well, with the exception of the unforgettably delicious  Brooklyn wings, you're bound to be yawning at the pricey menu, the franchise ambience, the takes-forever service--if you aren't blessed enough to get our most recent server there whose name escapes me--the small and needs-several-more-chairs front foyer and the ""bright"" hostess that held almost every table in the restaurant besides one with a large party, looked like a family was celebrating a graduation. She seemed overwhelmed by their celebration, and pretty much said that the kitchen couldn't handle any other orders, hence the 20 minute wait for us and the hungry people that almost left but were promptly whisked to a table once the hostess realized that they were leaving. My boyfriend complained! Yes we were hangry and a child was with us. There were so many open tables, so the crowd forming at the barely there waiting area didn't make sense.  The restaurant's manager overheard him complaining and prompted the hostess to seat more parties. We finally got our seat, but the fight to get it took my appetite away. I felt tired and the LO fell asleep on my lap shortly after he ordered.  We got the delicious Brooklyn wings, the meh jumbo lump crab cakes, and the flounder--a very basic version of fried fish and chips. Our food was just ok, as were our overly sweet and forgettable cocktails.  As many complaints as I have about Peaches, you'd think I wouldn't come back but truth be told it's the first place that comes to mind for a local date night. So I will be back but mainly for take out."
Very popular place. Something about the dishes that didn't taste 100%  Fried rice was a bit too saucy and the Thai ice tea was too sweet.  The lunch menu was a great deal though.
Sunday Brunch in LES  First time at Sweet Chicks and I wasn't disappointed. I ordered the Chicken and Waffles (white meat & extra crispy) . It came with a trio of flavored butter to smear over your waffles, delish! I also tried the Mac&Cheese which was very good too. It was like traditional baked Mac&Cheese but still very cheesy and tasty. And lastly, a glass of Reisling to take it all down. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is bc I had a good 30 min wait and also bc their menu has a small selection. The price point was average. The ambiance was cool. The service was great. I would go back there again when I'm in the neighborhood.
DO NOT BOTHER. Not worth the money or aggravation . My boyfriend and I have been going to this restaurant since it first opened, we live one block away. It was wonderful for over a year. The other night we went in & were surprised to find new staff. The bartender made me the worst martini I've ever had in my life( there were bubbles in it) and I sent it back. There is no sommelier there and I was shocked the hostess did not know what one was & looked at me as ifThe most offensive man said he would fix the situation, turned out he is the owner. He was rude and abrasive. Dinner arrived and it was just awful. Both appetizers & both main courses. I asked our server if they had a new cook & she said yes which explains a lot. AWFUL bartender, rude owner and not too smart staff: not worth $300 for two people. NEVER AGAIN.
"We almost missed this quaint restaurant is at the corner of a quiet street. I was visiting NYC fort boyfriends graduation and had several ""Must Try"" places. Little Owl was the first on my list so we decided to eat lunch here on the first day. When we arrived we had reservations made so we were quickly seated. The seating arrangement was difficult- literally everyone on the side of the bar was a couple of inches away from each other. Any person attempting to sit there hit the two small round tables behind them and the window seat look awkwardly close as well. It's Manhattan so i didn't care too much about the tight space though. I ordered the Artic Char while my boyfriend ordered the Bacon Burger which was greatly recommended by our waiter. The Char was cooked incredibly; the chef truly mastered it - but although it was soft and tender the taste was mediocre. Nothing stood out to me. If anything I felt that the fish should have been separated from the vegetables. The bacon burger also fell short of our expectations. My boyfriend enjoyed the meal but felt that it didn't blow his mind and the proportion was adequate.  The dining experience was good with attentive service but when I return to NYC, I won't be returning to little owl."
Served me soggy chicken, so I sent it back. Not one to do that, but I was not about to pay $15 for soggy friend chicken. You had one job. Then they sent me back the SAME PIECES OF CHICKEN, but did me the courtesy of putting them back in the deep fryer. Mmmm nothing like a plate of pure pettiness. Would not recommend.
Not impressed, especially with the hype and all the good reviews. My friend and I were one of the first to arrive at the restaurant and within 30 mins the entire place was seated. We took that as a good sign. Well, until we got our food that is. My friend's food came first. Mine came about 15-20 mins later. My friend had already finished eating by that point. On top of that, the appetizer we ordered came after our entrees. The food was mediocre. I have trouble recalling what I ordered so it must have been rather unimpressionable. Not sure who my server was either. But I do know for sure, there's better Korean food around the block with much better service. This place is more about turning tables than it is about providing service and quality food. I would much rather spend my money elsewhere.
Comfort food at its finest. My boyfriend and I were in the mood for some southern hospitality and fried chicken but are not into fast food joints. Came across this place on yelp and gave it a go.  The decor is cute and simple. We tried and  recommend the corn bread, fried chicken, burger and the cheese app.  The only thing I didn't like about this place is the hostess. We had a reservation on opentable and were running late, so we called to let her know we are still coming and not to cancel out our opentable as that would reflect negatively on our account. After the phone call that we were on our way, she went into the system and cancelled us out. That was not cool. We still are there however and gave them business so I think that was super unfair and inappropriate on her part.  Anyways, that's not to say anything about the chef and waitstaff, they were great.
"Came here last night and I'm disappointed at best. Wanted to go somewhere really special with my parents. Ended up thinking the restaurant was just .... Eh We ordered a lot of things, a few good ones- tamagoyaki (which was probably one of the best I've had), eggplant (above average, nothing special), pork belly (flavor ok, definitely could have been waaaay more tender), fried marinated chicken, uni soba (now this I enjoyed, but they only give you three teeny pieces of fresh uni), grilled onigiri, and the kabocha squash creme brûlée. All these items were just good, the only thing stellar was the tamago and maybe the fried chicken, which was also on the salty side. But come on, it's fried chicken..... The things that were average or below average- fried shrimp balls (there was NO fresh shrimp flavor, skip these), edamame (would have been good but came out frozen!!!!!!!!!!!!!), tuna natto (natto aficionados I was with said it wasn't stinky/authentic enough and there was also a tendon in my tuna), the beef tongue stew with daikon and taro (nothing special and way too salty and heavy), chilled tofu appetizer (nothing special... At all, skip). Skip the regular onigiri and get the grilled.  All in all, it may have been my expectations that ruined the meal. But I'm willing to bet that it was the lackluster food and mediocre service (nice waiter, but messed up two of our orders- the onigiri (he brought out the wrong flavors) and the edamame-which was frozen). At one point I even thought that perhaps it's because we didn't order the ""right"" things- but if you're a 4.5 star yelp restaurant and pretty damn expensive ($250 for four people), every damn item on the menu better be yummy. Izakaya is better and cheaper elsewhere- Mew izakaya and fukurou."
Great things to get: The Duck Special Sizzling Sisig The noodles were fine, but the above were excellent.  Get you in and out fast.  Solid service.  Know what they're doing.
Cute little bar & restaurant on Van Brunt in Redhook. Food is decent, though a bit heavy. Service tends to be adequate, a bit slow, and not especially friendly. All in all, it fills a need, though it's definitely not a destination. There are better options for food and/or drink in the neighborhood including Black Flamingo, Baked, Hometown, Sunny's & Seaborn. Go explore :)
Located in an a great area, Verlaine definitely can catch a persons eye.  The interior has a lounge feel when you walk with the tables and seat/couches in the front. Along the wall they have a lot of small tables lined up closely side to side. For the drinks most of them are lychee based. At first this sounded great to me, because how often can you get a drink with lychee in it? I got the actual Verlaine cocktail and I thought it was way to sweet. The lychee overkilled the entire drink and outside of that flavor it was pretty dull. I feel like drinking it had to be an acquired taste. At the same time, I also feel if I got something different I probably would have been more satisfied. Our server was excellent, she came to our table multiple times to ask us how we were doing. She was super polite. On top of that she seated and served us right away. Expect to pay between 12-14 dollars a drink. I personally think that's kind of expensive for the cocktails, but you be the judge.
The food was delicious! The services was good. Though not being busy two of our three meals arrived in about 20 mins and the third took an additional 10 mins. One thing to note, this is a cash only restaurant.
I can't tell you how much I loved this place!!  It has such a charming whimsical feel to it. The staff is awesome, but the food is even better!!!!!!!!! Thai tea, dumplings, Pho -- delish. They have a variety of Thai/Vietnamese dishes, so if you're not in the mood for pho, you can get something else.  Definitely make reservations!
Food is decent but not worth waiting 50 min. Line situation to order is out of control. Chipotle makes a better burrito. If it wasn't for good music and a nice outdoor atmosphere they would get zero stars.
I'm vegan, and I love Ethiopian food, so I should love Bunna, right? I really want to, I'm just not there yet. I had eaten at their pop-up, but was not impressed by crunchy, undercooked collards. I understand that there are challenges with pop-ups, so I was willing to give the restaurant a shot. We got the Feast for 2, and I thought all of the dishes were quite yummy. The collard issue had been solved! But what is up with the injera? It was so thin, dry and brittle that it was barely serving its function as an eating utensil. And then to have to pay $1 more for each extra piece of dry injera? The people next to us were using silverware. At first I silently judged them, but when I thought about it later, I had to give them credit for their problem-solving skills. Is the thick, spongy injera I get at other Ethiopian restaurants inauthentic? Was it an off night? Were you using up some gluten-free injera? I'm really hoping the injera improves because I would like to support a vegan Ethiopian restaurant!
It's a really nice restaurant. The lines are crazy. It's always almost packed. Aside from these reasons. My food was really good. But my husband had chicken and waffles. The chicken was almost burnt.  They is why I took a star out.
I just witness the server leaning over the pizza with  his open button up shirt was all ober the pizza. If i wanted chest hair with my 3 cheese pizza i wouldve ordered it, but thank god it went over to some poor ladys table not mine.
I was really excited to try this place being that it's the only one of it's kind in the area, not to mention the rave reviews and the unique decor from the pictures.  Stepping into Monroe you'd think you were in a trendy hip neighborhood, which really speaks to how much gentrification is slowly seeping into this area in Chinatown. The ambiance was one of the highlights; countless plants surround you on all sides while you sip on your cocktail and enjoy your meal. Really cool.  Cocktails were ~$11 and it was strong.  Patatas bravas- pretty good and filling for an appetizer Cured meat dish- prosciutto was good but the salami and ham (?) weren't anything special.  Carbonara- I'm a huge fan of carbonara but I wasn't feeling this one as much. It was a bit on the drier side; more cheesy and less egg-y. Also the meat bits were so much fattier than what I'm used to. T-bone steak- the best thing we ordered. Cooked perfectly and flavor was on point. Enjoyed the sauce that came with it. Creme brulee was good, although a tad on the sweeter side. Still good. Service was really great! 3 stars for now but I'll be back for brunch!
As far as French bistros go, this is not one of my favorites. I ordered the Chicken Chez Moi, which was drowning in a butter sauce. Too much for my liking. It came with fries that were pretty low grade - kind of flavorless, kind of scrawny, kind of homogeneous. The food wasn't necessarily bad, it was just kind of mediocre. I would rather spend my $17 on an entree somewhere else.
When you finally become a regular is when they start giving you better customer service. The hand pulled noodles are good with just the soup. Their pork chops are not the greatest. But I would recommend their knife peeled noodles with shrimp and pork! Super delicious!
This is one of those times where I feel the pictures looked way better than the food tasted.  I came here on my birthday with my hubby for lunch and I got the original lobster 1.5 lb ($28) and he ordered the combo for 1 which includes a 6oz. Burger and a 1lb lobster ($33). Look, this place is just burger or lobster so when a place only offers 2 main ingredients, it should be fantastic! Right? Wrong. The burger was actually pretty good, cooked medium rare as we wanted, and flavorful. Their meat is sourced from la Frieda so honestly can't mess up a burger. The lobsters were a whole different story.  First off, my 1.5 lb lobster was mushy which means this little guy was dead before they started cooking him. It's a fact that once lobster dies, their meat begins to soften. Don't believe me? Google it. Second, the 1lb lobster was tough and chewy. I almost choked eating this guy because after a few minutes of chewing and not being able to break it down anymore, I tried to swallow and it almost got stuck in my throat. And last but not least, the 1 lb and 1.5 lb looks about the same size yet the price is a $8 difference.  Only good thing about the lobster was the lemon garlic butter that came with it. Overall, a pretty disappointing meal. Thumbs down. Sad emoji.
Came here during my break from work. While I did really like the decor since it seems very tranquil and peaceful and the service was very nice, I was not a fan of the price and the taste of the food. I got the Sushi sandwich for $16 which I found absolutely ridiculous. There is no way that four rice balls filled with a very thin piece of eel should cost this much. I have to admit, the first few bites were very delicious and I thought the sauce complimented the sushi sandwich very well. But after eating more of it, it just leaves a very nasty/fish after-taste which I did not like.  While the fact that this place is located in the UES might explain why the prices are so insanely high, I know I won't come back and get ripped off again.
Tried the eggplant toast, trout and roast chicken. Prices on the dinner menu are not really in line with the neighborhood so be prepared for some sticker shock before you arrive. The space is lovely with lots of window seating and attentive service.  I appreciated some risks taken with flavor pairings - cherries were served alongside my coconut curry trout and it worked! Fish was cooked perfectly and all the vegetables were at peak freshness so this kitchen is on point.  In general the portions were quite small for the price but the two of us felt stuffed after sharing one appetizer and two entrees as the food was pretty heavy. While Midwinter Kitchen is charming, it felt like a splurge and I would personally choose a more exotic menu for special occasions. I would have made this 4 stars if prices were more in line with casual weeknight dining in this area.
One of the best chicken rice I've had. Authentic. Btw, they don't accept credit card here.
Our friends in Chelsey invited us to dinner at Pepe Giallo.  We were super excited to go to this restaurant because it is super popular with the locals and it is charming.  It's a neighborhood kind of restaurant with everyone enjoying their meals!  This location has sidewalk, indoor, and outdoor patio seating. I ordered the special of the day - Green Linguini.  It was fresh spinach linguini, made with a generous portion of mussels and lobster claw meat.  This dish had a lot of potential, but I actually was quite dissapointed in my meal.  I loved the fact that they used fresh pasta for the dish.  However, I think the cook was a bit overwhelmed when cooking the dish, because someone forgot to mix the pasta as it boiled in the hot water.  The noodles were under cooked and the pasta was stuck together.  The pasta was visually beautiful, but lacked flavor and taste.  Prominent was the tomato sauce flavor, but it had no flavor otherwise. I took a bite of the neighboring Vodka Penne dish, and it was pretty tasty. I think it was just my dish that was a dissapointment.  I'd be glad to go back and give this place another try. Food Grade:  D+ Service Grade:  C  (The place was busy and we got minimal service). Worth The Money Grade:  B Overall Impression Grade:  C / D+
More of a 3.75 stars for food , service was good at 4 stars . Ippudo is a solid choice for ramen , my friend raves about their gyoza but I didn't see it maybe I blind . Having tried ichiran , and one of the best ramen shops ever afuri . Life just isn't the same in the ramen game for me. If I was in the area and feeling ramen then yes I would come here again but I would not go out of my way for 45 minutes just to have their ramen type of deal . We got two different ramen , teh shio and spicy tonkatsu . I thought the spicy one was too heavy but the noodles itself was pretty good .. perfect chew and bounce. The Pork bun just skip taht totally don't get it .
Oh Lordy.  Arrived in New York with my daughter this evening a little exhausted, but looking forward to dining at Inatteso.  It came well recommended. We walked in and we were seated immediately.  After a brief wait, the hostess took our drink order, a negroni for me, nothing for my daughter.  A few minutes later, some tap water was poured and bread was brought to the table. Then, the wait, and the wait, and the wait. In a dining room a bit more than half full, we waited over 20 minutes (being generous here) without receiving so much as a dismissive look from the wait staff. The topper was when a fah-buh-lous couple with a child--seated next to us AFTER we were seated--had their order taken promptly. I wasn't expecting special treatment here, just want to be treated fairly. Rather than be the a-hole who makes a stink because he was snubbed, I got the check for my drink and left.  Looks like there is a heavy neighborhood and regular crowd at Inatesso, and if you aren't one of those, you find out the hard way. So, while I have not tasted Inatteso's food, I don't want to find out if it tastes as bad as the front of the house is run. And I'm still hungry.
"Good pizza. Long line. Loud as heck inside.  But a classic Margharita and added meatballs was very good.  Best ever? Been to Italy several times and had good pies in SF so can't give it best ever title. That said, for a tremndously busy place the quality is okay. Had a seat at the bar watching the ""chefs"" make the pies and they are working non-stop.  It's fun. And it's an institution. So check it out if you're closeby. The views of Manhattan are spectacular at the park."
"Came here because I wanted to try another shanghainese establishment besides Joe's Shanghai. My husband and I ordered enough food to feed a village just to compare. The soup dumplings (aka steamed ""tiny buns"", as written on the menu) was so much better than Joe's. Unfortunately, that was the only dish that came out on top. The wonton soup, drunken chicken (aka wine chicken), and young chow fried rice lacked in flavor in comparison.  We also ordered the scallion pancakes, pork pan fried noodles, and baby shanghai veggies - dishes we've never ordered at Joe's before - and they were pretty good. The scallion pancake was thin, deep fried, super crunchy, but a tad too salty. The pan fried noodles and veggies were my 2 favorites aside from the soup dumplings. Service was great. I did not feel rushed at all!! The restaurant feels less crowded and had a more comfortable ambience. I just didn't like the food as much as I'd hoped. PS: amex or cash only!"
We went to Blvd Bistro with high hopes, but were greatly disappointed. Although the staff is quite friendly, the place is tiny, crowded, and extremely noisy. Don't plan to have a conversation unless you can lip read. Sad to say, too, the food was so-so at best. Wish we could be more encouraging, but we can't.
I've been here before in this restaurant's prior incarnation as an Italian inspired restaurant (which did not fare so well). This place has kept the similar decor but revamped the menu to modern American, which I think was a good choice. The appetizers here are pretty good - roasted beet salad was well done and the grilled octopus was tender and the sauce was rich and flavorful.  The salmon in port and butter sauce was also well done albeit a bit on the small side.  Roasted duck breast was also done well but portion might have been a tad small.   Although its simple food, its well done.  Service is good.  All in all a good showing, 3.5 stars.
It was nice because we made a reservation so we got seated immediately. There wasnt a lot of people tho, so there was plenty of room. I went with a party of 8. We sat at the outside seats. The view was exactly outside of the 911 memorial. They first asked us for our drink and they never came back after like 15+ mins.Slow service. Then we ordered, the waiters were very nice. Then for the food tasted terrible the sand wich pressed chicken and brie ew its tasted like rotten stuff.The fries were good tho. Overall waiters and view was good but slow service and shitty food.
Newly opened outpost of one of the best tacos spots in the city. Order at the register and hand your ticket to the cooks to the left of the register to get your tacos. Don't lose your ticket, no ticket no tacos! The tacos may look small but they are meaty and filling. Two will be enough to fill most, three if you're starving. Corn over flour wrap. My go to are the chicken and pork. Condiments is available on the side and are self serve. No seating just standing bar tables. It can get pretty crowded during peek lunch and dinner hours.
"I've eaten here quite a few times and normally the food is fantastic, but unfortunately this latest trip (May 30, 2017) was a miss. The main item I keep coming back for is the roast chicken for two. On this visit the breast was overcooked, ruining its taste and texture. The normally wonderful stuffing of brioche, truffle, and foie under the skin was burnt. The separate dish of leg meat didn't suffer from being overcooked but was oversalted.  Fortunately the other items we had were much better and included a foie torchon that was excellent and agnolloti with peas, morels, in a rich tasting yet light sauce. Desserts were also great including their carrot cake and a very tasty interpretation of ""milk and honey"" which had a wonderfully play of creamy and crispy textures with sweet and salty notes.  Overall the other items weren't enough to save the letdown of the main course. Normally I'd send it back but we were celebrating an engagement for another couple and I didn't complain to avoid an hour wait to cook a new chicken. If the consistency improves I'd return."
Wandered in here with a big group at like 3 am after seeing a performance at Greenwood Cemetery. Was really sad that the food window was closed, but made do with craft beers, cocktails, and ambiance. This place is beautiful and interesting-looking, a nice change from the dark wood and white subway tiles at every new bar in Brooklyn, ever. Decent-priced drinks, friendly bar staff who turned down the A/C when we asked (we'd been outside for hours, and we were cold!), cool weird murals, and an outside with picnic tables, gravel paths, and koi ponds that I'd love to check out sometime when we're actually allowed out there. (They let us go take a look, but the yard was closed so the neighbors could sleep.) The best part was the fake candles on every tables. They have alarms that flash red and beep when you tip them over! This amused us for probably longer than it should have.  Overall, I'm glad this place is in the neighborhood and I'm looking forward to going back.
"It's extremely sad to say this... because I actually love this place. But I order to go and they give me so much less salad everytime. This time they didn't even have the to go boxes, put them in containers and when I looked at it and asked for more because they weren't even half full I was told ""I don't know what goes on in the kitchen sorry"". I am actually appalled and extremely disappointed because this WAS a great place.  I have included two pictures in that section also because the pizza was half the size and the crustinis were so small. Paying the same price for a lot  less. We are loyal customers too (literally order at least once a week) and when I said something there was ""nothing they could do""...? Ok."
The room is great.  The service is attentive.  The food is delicious.  It is pricey ($320 for four, including cocktails), but the food is delicious.
Love their fusion! It's different and creative and that's what I like. Must try their coconut rice. Everything was delicious. My friend and i went on a Tuesday night and it wasn't packed which is good. I will be back to try their other yummy dishes. Service was great.
It was a very creative space, but unfortunately the space design is more interesting than everything we ordered.  We were looking forward to try authentic Vietnamese food with a street vendor type of feeling. This place looked promising. We ordered papaya salad, grass fed beef and catfish. When we received the menu, we immediately noticed how unnecessarily expensive everything was. And then when we got the food, we were underwhelmed. The rice noodle was overcooked, the dressing was overpowered by fish sauce, the beef was juicy, good quality but very oily. And with not much food, we paid about $50 everything included. Although we are energized by the vibe in the little place and the interesting design (hence two stars rather than one) we are disappointed by the food, and definitely won't go back again. The hunt for good vietnamese food in queens continues.
I finally stopped into Crescent Grill after living in the neighborhood for over a year.  I sat at the bar, and George was the bartender, service was very good, although I was the only person seated at the bar.  I ordered the Duck breast, which was solid, and had good flavor, but I guess it just didn't meet expectations.  The meat was a little tough and wasn't as tender as I would have expected.  I thought the prices on the menu were a little high, but I did like the idea of having a unique menu.  Although, I wasn't totally impressed with the meal, the service was good and I would be willing to try something else off the menu.
terrible service, we wait for a long time for filling up water. It cost too much time for waiting this night, and the food is just okay, not such fantastic as ad shows.
I'd like to see this place around for while. Smith street is not an easy street with places shutting down left and right- high rents most likely being the reason.  Really amazing service and great touch on the food and beer list. It is the feel you want from a classy gastro with the right amount of noise and bar atmosphere joining forces with fine cuisine. I am down for another round.
Once a great place with long lines. Today was my last day ever there. Over priced over rated. Bad service. They move you through their conveyor belt with no care for anything but getting your $25-30 and getting you out the door. The ramen was not piping hot. The chicken and meat were all dry. The beer didn't come with cold frosty glasses. The lady was not nice. Do yourself a favor and go to the many other ramen and Japanese places nearby. It's also cash only. Shoulda known food was going south with the short line.  Still several months (6) later this place makes me so mad. They are a horrible experience from the blaring music to rushing you out to not truly embodying what Japanese restaurant service is all about. They've basically become a tourist trap. Or at least possess the traits of one: poor food, lines and bad service.
"Came here for a celebration with friends... ehhh... Place is very fancy, high end, luxury decor! Service: We were a party of 10ppl, when we went to check in, 2 very attractive hostess say is our entire party here, I say ""yes, 9 of us are here, the 10th one is parking his car as we speak.""  Her response is ""oh okay... let us know when the 10th person arrives and we will seat you"" Really? lol...  aside from that silly response/misunderstanding... the service here was EXCELLENT! as you would expect from any fine dining establishment. Setting: Great Decor! But what I especially liked, unlike most places, is they have CIRCULAR group tables, which allows everyone to conversate, unlike the long linear tables...  BUT, we are here for the food, and sadly, I must grade based on primarily the food. Food was OKAY for the price.  I don't mind paying top dollar for good food, but IMO, the food was okay... we had seafood sampler ($39pp), 1 tentacle of an octopus ($22), smoked fish plate ($25), Chilean Seabass ($56), Porterhouse for 2 ($110)."
Great dim sum at the best prices! I love the spicy peanut dumpling and of course the soup buns. Service is courteous to friendly depending on who helps you, but never bad. We're regulars here!  Definitely no frills but one can understand the Michelin star- it's all incredibly fresh and leaves you satisfied and not weighed down with potential additives. Highly recommend!
First time trying this place, ordered delivery of gyro and chicken souvlaki platters. The fries arrived soggy and the chicken was dry, cold, tasteless, and burnt. Unfortunately not worth $14 a plate. Resulted in a failed New Years celebration dinner. We're shocked based on the gleaming reviews.
"OVERRATED!!!  TOO MUCH SAUCE WHICH WAS ALSO TOO SWEET, PLAIN AND NOT TASTY. NOT ENOUGH CHEESE AT ALL. Arrived hardly warm.  I enjoy my pizza by sprinkling on some Arugula. I asked my waiter if I could please purchase a side of it. I received an arbitrary ""no"". He said the only way I can have Arugula is if I purchased another item, which he pointed to, that was $35. He was seriously asking me if I wanted to get it too. Really?? I went downstairs to speak to a manager about the Arugula and it was not not possible. It's the owners strict rules. I cannot fathom, if they have have an item on the premises, why can't they make the customer happy with this small request and make my experience enjoyable?  Now, if I liked the pizza enough, to fix that problem, I'd pack and smuggle in a little baggie of Arugula with me. Heheh. But, trust a girl from Brooklyn that knows pizza, it' nothing to write home about!  If you're out of town and in or around New York, and want the best pizza, feel free to message me where you are, and I will be more than happy to send you in the right direction. ONE PLUS? Good salad dressing for the house salad.  Sincerely,  An honest crowd"
This is a really lovely place with great potential. Amazing live wall of plants. Cozy seating, nice menu. Too bad our service was disappointing.  We had high hopes for fun birthday lunch but it took 45 minutes for our food to arrive- supposedly because the salmon wasn't ready. Even before that , our wine seemed to get lost in space. When they finally brought our main courses ,the salmon  was tasteless- not a speck of seasoning. Nothing to write home about , and the  potatoes/ broccoli  it was one was luke warm. To make us feel better they brought out a bowl of soup ( also luke warm) and potato chips ( tasted like Wise)with our order-  I had to ask, even after telling them in the reservation and when I arrived , about a birthday celebration. They brought the dessert menus and we ordered a dessert- which wasn't very good- and they charged us $10 for it. I would love to go back and have a positive experience, but don't expect one.
Why walk into this place and order anything besides the burger and lobster combo? A veritable no-go for vegans  At a $33 price point for a whole lobster and a gourmet burger, fries, and salad, the price is quite right. The whole concept of surf-n-turf being an exercise in epicurean hedonism notwithstanding, they do a pretty good job at it. The location itself is huge, modern, and well-maintained. Professional staff bustle about managing tons of orders without issue. The burger is nothing to write home about but it does the job with thick pieces of bacon to top it off. The lobster doesn't necessarily come out piping hot everytime but at least it's always fresh and juicy.  It's a challenge to finish everything because of the sheer quantity, but afterwards you have this weird sense of pride just being a human being that has the luxury of eating a deliciously cooked land animal and sea crustacean at the same time...i'm not high right now I promise
"Japanese comfort food, tapas-style, that doesn't break the bank!  The tapas we got (in order of ""would definitely get again"" to ""not bad""  1) Smoked pork belly with black kaimi sauce. You don't even need the sauce to taste the smokeyness but it's even better with the black sauce!  2) Shrimp and capers with some corn in a yummy glaze. I'm partial to sweet corn and could've eaten a whole bowl of this.  3) Garlic beef steak - like it sounds, delectable slices of steak, marinated in a demi-glace  4) Anchovy fried potatoes - if you get these make sure to mix the anchovy toppings around with the potatoes!  The ""entree""  Una-Tama don - eel over rice with egg cracked on top. Super comforting and delicious. Served with wooden spoons in a big bowl. Would definitely get this again.  Ask for hot tea, it's free.  Their sake selections seemed extensive! The table next to us was order flights on flights.  4 small dishes and an entree was enough for two people, with a little room for dessert!"
Ambience: picture the old style lobster shack on the docks along US1 in Maine. Crowded and hectic (especially at peak lunchtime) but well worth the wait. Food: so far I've had their shrimp roll, the crab roll and the lobster roll (on separate occasions). The shrimp and crab rolls were above average but not perfect. Say 8 out of 10 for either yet still well worth the price. The lobster roll is a delight ... chunks of tender lobster meat in a buttered New England style roll. A definite 10.
"Supremely upset. On a special occasion, a birthday, that had been stated not just once with the initial reservation, but also again confirmed with a phone call on my end 15 mins before walking into the restaurant to ensure that he would have a desert or ANY type of specialty brought to him did not happen at all and instead were dismissed as if it were our fault. Crushed doesn't even cover the feeling after having carefully planned the night out and SPECIFICALLY making sure that the restaurant I chose would help me in celebrating ended up completely disregarded all of my efforts. The mindblowing part being that I called 15 MINUTES BEFORE to make sure everything would go as planned. Not only that, but when confronting the hostess about the situation after the fact, she then stated ""I don't know why nobody told the waiter about the birthday, but we don't give out free deserts""...insulted is an understatement. I would have paid beyond (as I did with my tip despite all of this) for my boyfriend to be celebrated, but then as I was signing my bill we were delivered a scoop of ice cream with a flippant sorry. I can't even describe the feeling I have right now. The milling room is not a place to go if you want your special nights to go as planned, take your business and your memorable moments elsewhere. No acknowledgment from management or any part of the restaurant. Thank you for ruining our night."
"Beware: Don't come for dinner. Drinks might be a different story but I can't comment on that experience. Came here with my family for a nice rooftop dinner. At first I thought this place would great.. Sushi and a view! How could you beat that? Well long story short, the service was horrendous. As bad as the waitress's knowledge on the menu and ingredients in stock that day.  The food came out at a decent time, not too long of a wait time. All looked super pleasing to the eye, but honestly nothing to rave about.. and at these prices, the food should literally make me scream and shout.  The waitress we had was completely clueless on the menu, we asked about the chef's sushi special of the day and she literally said ""It's whatever the chef feels like making that day, and I don't know what that is."" Umm, okay, great answer! My sister ordered the coconut curry rice, which was supposed to have clams in the dish. When she realized there were no clams and asked the waitress about it she offered to bring her dish back in and remake it with clams. We objected and politely asked if she could just bring out the missing ingredient on a plate. She came back and said ""Sorry, we actually don't have any clams in stock today."" So.... were you literally about to take the plate into the kitchen and bring it back out again with no clams? Why didn't you tell us you didn't have this in stock? We're paying the same price, with a missing shellfish... which is probably a factor of the dish's price. The waitress then forgot to add our Groupon coupon to the check when we specifically handed it to her as soon as we were seated at her table. Once she edited the check for us, she literally disappeared into the wind for a good 15 minutes. We had to beckon the hostess over to finish out our transaction.  I would not recommend to my friends (even though the view is awesome) and will not come back."
The food was delicious and presented attractively. The ambiance was fine. But the ordering rules are not customer friendly, very confusing. The service was lack luster, and food was not well timed, and expensive for what you get.
Enjoyed the food and patio atmosphere. We sat outside and enjoyed a beautiful brunch in the sunshine. I would second a previous review that the service was decent, but not stellar.
thank goodness i had made reservations..it was packed when we got here! i overheard the hostess telling people walkin in with no reservations that it would be about an hour and 45 min wait! we did have to wait about 10 min to get seated at our table..waitress was very friendly n helpful..huge menu on wall..was told all entrees are family style portions so one entree can serve 2 people..my gf and i ordered a cocktail..she got the lemon drop amd i tried the fizzy peach punch..we both enjoyed our drinks..appetizet we got the fried calamari..very delicious! cooked perfect!we ordered a caesar salad with anchovies on the side..woww they werent kidding when they said family style portions! it couldve fed 3-4 people! salad was great..mixed well with dressing so that every green was dressed..we decided on the spaghetti n meatballs...waiter served us our first serving tableside..meatballs were delicious! tender soft n flavorful..so was the sauce..spaghetti al dente..sprinkled parmesan atop all of it..ate so much but it was so good! no room for dessert but we were satisfied with the food n service!
What a cool find! Dutch Freds is open late. There's a cool theatre crowd here, super awesome friendly staff and lovely craft cocktails and comfort food. All this in a sophisticated kind of prohibition-ey space. They've got amazing flat breads, fries, mac and cheese and other lovely food... Get the Brussels Sprouts hash! Perfect spot for a meal before or after theatre or a drink anytime. My new go-to theatre district resto!!
Within the top 5 meals for me. This special elegant experience exceeded on every level . Our meal was an experience of course some of that was our table, some the location. Some the decor, some the wine, meal and desert.  This is a place where you'll walk away with more than a great meal.  Hats off !
Great service!!! Absolutely five star service!!! Food was good modern Asian. Lots of flavor and surprisingly good portion actually. Very well worth it. The Manager Alex came by to check on us multiple times. Had a great time there!
My husband used to work at a tapas place and since then we have been obsessed with finding tapas. We were more than pleased when we bumped into Despaña. The shop specializes on Spanish food and ingredients. There's always samples on the shelf and the counter. Yesterday I enjoyed a Marcona almond, some fig and manchego. My mouth was so happy. The three were the best flavor profie. There was also some fruity olive oil. I even tried a lovely meaty olive. At the end of the food tasting you are greeted with a variety of tortilla. I normally like to keep it simple, Tortilla  Española  and Pintxo Boqueron. Sometimes I will order the hot chocolate to go with my brunch. There's always a lovely bottle of olive oil on every table and a bottle of sherry vinegar. I love drizzling the two over my tortilla and boqueron and a crack of the pepper. This is sometimes the perfect breakfast. The seating is family style and casual.  Those Spaniards know how to live the good life. I highly recommend to come here for a taste of Spain and also if you are entertaining. This is a great place to pick up some noshes for you and your friends.
The missing link between fast food and quality restaurant has been solved!   Joju is a quaint little store in the middle of Elmhurst that seems to have it all.  From the appetizer menu to the main entrees, they have it all.  I've gone here more times than I can count on a single finger and finally feel like I can do justice with my review. Starting from the appetizers, they have a wide selection of delectable dishes.  I've tried the Kimchi fries and they have a perfect balance of savory and spicy.  There's a hint of sour to stay true to the kimchi flavor that it's originally based on.  The spiciness never overpowers the rest of the dish and the spicy mayo sauce is an excellent last touch. The Soy and Garlic wings once served seemed to tease me to take a bite right away.  They did not disappoint.  With crunchiness and a flavor that could stand toe-to-wing to any Korean fried chicken restaurant, each bite resonates with your mouth and gives a burst of flavor with each piece. The main dishes are of course, the bahn mi.  The fusion of different asian cuisines stays true here.  A connoisseur could see the blend of Taiwanese, Vietnamese, and even Korean when eating carefully.  I've had the Joju monster and even limited edition bahn mi like the Jeremy Lin.  I have to warn people that the spicy green sauce lives up to its name.  I needed a drink right away to save myself a trip to the hospital.  Luckily, there was lots of bubble tea available to save me. Each bahn mi here has a variety of toppings that compliment the sandwich.  The best part?  They always stack and fill the sandwich to its max (sometimes even more).  That means each one you order will have its fill of radish, carrots, and meat.  Truly, your stomach will appreciate every single time you come here. -amazing service -good prices and staff is always patient -great selection of choices from appetizers to entrees -rewards loyal customers with reward cards -only wish they had a dessert menu besides bubble tea -would definitely come here again and again!
Ugh so we were craving mashed potato after few drinks so we came to this place. Everyone told me it was whatever place but i was kinda excited to try this place. Well okay we only order side because we were full but if you are not happy about it and please just mention that on the menu not like express that feeling to us. How small we order we still are customer. I actually liked mashed potato and avocado toast but I dont think ill come back to this place ever since forrest point or other places near here has good food and better service no matter what you order.
It was a great night!!  Especially the seafood boil was so much fun and very tasty. I definitely want to come back to try other menus because they have huge menus. We will never get bored. I'm really glad I have such a great restaurant in my neighbor.
I love the vibe of this place. Cool crowd. Good food. My personal favorite drink is the Brooklyn Mule. The pricing is totally reasonable.  My biggest compliant (and the reason I only gave 3 stars) is that the MUSIC IS WAAAAAY TOO LOUD. I've been there a few times on different nights and always leave much earlier than I want to because the music kills my eardrums.  The music itself is great and lends to the vibe. But the volume is out of control. It's like they use speakers that are more appropriate for a concert at Barclays; not a small restaurant nook on Nostrand.   If you're dining alone, bring earplugs. If you want to talk with someone, bring a megaphone.
Get your local craft beer and eating on at this new Ridgewood bar. Craft Culture has a wide selection of beers on tap and staff who can share their thoughts on their new favorite brew. If you're in the mood for a beer with some food you also have a variety on the menu ranging from your classic pretzel to empanadas and their sliders which were fantastic!
If I can give this place negative stars I would. Service was completely horrible!!!!! When my friend and I asked for a menu at the bar a male bartender threw the menu towards us! Did not even bother asking us if we wanted anything! I work for customer relations and  all I can say is this make bartender needs some serious customer relationship skills. Would never bother even driving by this place.
A great no frills place to have some delicious soup dumplings. The staff is very quick and not very friendly. Don't expect them to go out of their way. I would say this is in the top 5 dumplings I have tasted. But they are not the best I have ever had. Still worth visiting though!
Pretty good dry aged beef briskets. I have had very good Texas BBQ before so I could tell that the briskets here were of really high quality. The briskets didn't have the Texas flavors, but less salty, and had a hint of sweet taste. The meat had a deepness in its taste. Probably thanks to the aging process. The briskets were REALLY tender and the meat was falling apart when we were distributing the foods. I kinda thought that since the chef was Asian, he was introducing the Asian taste into the traditional Texas brisket cuts. I also liked that the pan was of really high quality, which made the briskets' presentation more inviting. Adding basil to the briskets pan made the meal both more handsome, and tasty. For the sides, kimchi, rice, and cabbage were regular, not great. I liked their lettuce cuz they were thick and firm, so easy to wrap. Their White sauce was like Halal food white sauce, and hot sauce wasn't even hot. Wrapping everything in a ssam style of eating made the meal even more interesting and delicious! It was a great fusion of American briskets and asian sides. Really exciting. I enjoyed eating it in ssam style more than eating the meat by itself. I  tried to have the meat by itself and with rice (since we ran out of sides), and it also tasted excellent. Only downside was that they were very skimpy on the sides. We would be charged for second helpings of kimchi, cabbage, white sauce, hot sauce and lettuce. We a group of 7 spent $45 for everything tax + tips, so I thought it was pretty reasonably - and we were all full.   Definitely will be back to try their duck if i have a chance.
Really is as good as it gets in terms of high quality asian fusion. Just the classics made right with the incorporation of new twists on the old classics.  Came here with a party of 6 and our waiter Ben suggested we get the tasting menu (best idea). The entire meal consisted of 16 course each crafted and served in the perfect order from start to finish. There really was nothing to complain about when it came down to the food and service. Everything was perfect. The flavors were spot on.  Each dish will put you in awe. If you come with a large group I highly recommend getting the tasting menu (you have 3 to choose from we chose #2). The tasting menu is large and will definitely satisfy!  Great service and amazing food. i will be back!
We went there for lunch. I had the coconut shrimp, it looked good from appearance, but the food was just okay.  The mash potatoes was cold.  My husband had feijoaga, he felt sick afterwards and think it was the food.  On top of that, they automatically charge 15% gratuity on your bill and then still leave a blank field for tips on your receipt, kinda tricky if you don't pay attention to the itemized bill.   Probably won't go back again.
The food was good when this place first opened - but since then the prices and the service have changed. I ordered take out tonight and the order was wrong and I was over-charged. When I realized this, I called the restaurant several times but no one picked up the phone.  Very disappointing.
"We had high hopes for this place especially since Tutti closed. We sat down right away and they were very accommodating with our stroller. Right away, we ordered pizza and were told that it would take 45 MINUTES bc they ""just opened yesterday""... ummm ok, fine. Ordered wine, took 25 minutes to get. Pasta was ok- def not worth the price. 60 minutes later- still no pizza... we remind the waitress and she says ""it's on its way"" 2 Minutes later we get the bill. Still NO PIZZA. We ask again for the pizza ""oh- it's coming"". 15 mins later, no pizza. Horrible service! The guys cleaning and filling up the water are WONDERFUL, maybe they should be running this place. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE PIZZA TRUCK TAKES 8 MINUTES AND AT THIS PLACE IT TAKES 2 HOURS. Wait 3 weeks before coming here."
I was a bit disappointed about this place and the food we had during our lunch. We (4 friends) came here because a friend of mine said that this was an authentic soul food restaurant so we decided to choose Amy's Ruth as our restaurant on a hot day in June. Let's start with the food: a lot of choices from the menu will let you a bit lost trying to understand which main is best for you but please,make sure that at least the food is something you can't forget!  One of my friend had The Reggie Harris but chicken was too sweet and very dry (I tried a little bit..as usual!),another friend had Fisherman's Platter which said was pretty good and another one had an appetiser (Fresh Jumbo Salmon Croquettes) which was too heavy and deep fried without any taste. I was a little bit healthier (too much junk food during the week!) so I had a salad with chicken (The Judge George B. Daniels) which was ok, nothing special. Portions are pretty big but if what you're eating is not good, who cares about how big is the dish you've ordered? Staff is lovely and friendly and also the place itself is cosy with wall decorated with painting of afro-american's celebrities/politicians. Price: too expensive for what you get.
I came to Up Thai for dinner the other night and was very impressed with the service however the food itself wasn't anything special.  The Pad Sew-Ee was the best thing we ordered and I would definitely recommend but the Gai Yang wasn't very good at all. The chicken was flavorless and the sauces didn't mix well with the dish.
I'm currently extremely upset right now...... they told me there was no salmon when the only thing I wanted was salmon. My friend came 15 minutes later and sat down.. time passes and he's eating a salmon! Seriously and the pizza is really watery and sloppy. Then they said they had no asparagus and he was eating asparagus!! Then I asked for my soda 4 times before I got it. I'm literally infuriated!!!!!!!!
WORST customer service. We sat 12:20pm didn't get our order taken until at least 15+ mins after we sat. Server or back of house MISPLACED the ticket, so our order was never made. When we told the manager, they said they could prepare it now. Mind you, we were there on our lunch hour. So we had to pack up RAMEN and other entrees, which you can imagine isn't something you at your desk - hence why we went to a restaurant. Manager did nothing to correct the situation. Waitress had the audacity to say 'next time you come, it takes more than 25 minutes.' In reality, she didn't even check on the table to know that we never got our food. The restaurant had no idea until we brought it to their attention that we sat there for 50 minutes and DIDNT have our food. This isn't quick and easy place, and they know nothing about hospitality.
I ordered this place based strictly on the reviews thinking it couldn't be bad, its pizza.  It wasn't bad by any means but i just expected better especially 26 for a pie and 2 cans of soda.  I ordered a prosciutto and arugula pizza and the cheese kept constantly coming off which was a huge bummer!  They are also cash only which was a downer.  The delivery driver was nice but she forgot to give me the arugula for the pizza and came back to the apartment 10  min later after I already huffed down half the pie.  I would try somewhere else but maybe I just got the wrong thing, IDK but there is so many options in the area, I would try something else
"Family and I decided to come here for dinner after a night of exploring/walking around NYC. The wait for a table (for 5) was about 25 minutes - granted we came on Sunday Jan 1st (New Years Day). The place itself is relatively small, we finally got a table by the window & the server took our order (food & drink). About 20 minutes in, we see that others around us have already gotten their order, so hubby asks ""when's our food coming"" - also, btw, they didn't give us our drinks yet. Another 10 minutes later our food (and drinks) finally arrives! We all got chicken except for mom who got the fish fry basket. We all enjoyed our food - but it tasted good to us because we were soooo hungry from the wait. I gotta say though, that the fried chicken was tasty & moist... and the sides (mashed potatoes/gravy, coleslaw, biscuit) went well with it. Our fave part of the meal was the coveted banana cream pie! Make sure to save room for that. At least once slice! We also ordered a slide of apple pie a la mode but the banana cream pie tasted better. To summarize: fried chicken & sides was 4 stars, banana cream pie was 5 stars, slow service (we think they forgot our order but just didn't tell us!) 2 stars."
We were in the city for the whole day and this was a very satisfying mean after a tiring day. The ambience is great, location is convenient and the food excellent. My son had the seafood pasta, I had the fish of the day with pasta and my wife had the linguine. All of them were fresh and tasty without being too cheesy. I had a local Brooklyn beer on tap and that was very refreshing too. Highly recommended.
This place has good food but the guy who works here is grumpy. He yelled at me for taking photos of the place. I was going to give a great review, but customer service matters. It makes or breaks someones impression of a place. The artichoke slice is excellent. Very flavorful, saucy, and crispy light crust. There is a $6 minimum for debit or credit. 7 chairs here which is enough for you to get a slice, eat it and get out. We went around lunch time and there were enough chairs for 3 of us to sit. There are nicer Artichoke  locations with much friendlier staff. The one by the high line is the best. Food with a view! There is also no bathroom here.
I can't believe yelp deleted my review for this establishment because it's a negative review. What's the point of asking me to write a review if you guys are going to delete it anyways especially after the owner of the establishment basically told me to go F myself if I don't like their food? I can get better sheesh kabab from a food cart than from his restaurant and would only cost a fraction of what they charge at their restaurant.
Came here about a year ago and absolutely loved it, there wasn't one thing I tried that wasn't delicious. We did attempt to go back this last April but sadly found out that it was closed due to a fire. We proceeded to go to their sister restaurant in hopes for a similar experience and that was a major bust, we didn't even end up sitting to eat due to the horrid service. But this restaurant is a must!
Tried their delivery service. First time I ordered margherita with basil over the phone. It took them an hour and a half to deliver a stone cold pizza with one basil leaf shredded around. However, this is the only brick oven pizza in my area, so I decided to give them another chance. This time I ordered via   so I had an approximate delivery time and a mechanism to complain if anything was wrong. Well I was waiting for an hour, after which a person from   called me and said they can't reach the restaurant. I tried to call them myself multiple times, and it simply seemed like someone was hanging up the phone (number of signals varied with each phone call). This was at 9 p.m. which is 2 hours before closing time! I saw complaints about their customer service and reliability, but this is just beyond ridiculous. I will never be ordering from them.
I always start to doubt myself when I have a bad experience at somewhere so highly rated, but honestly I cannot see what all the fuss is about and I left here feeling really disappointed. One thing I will say is that the service is very fast and efficient...almost too fast and efficient. Within 5 minutes of arriving, we had already been served and were tucking into our appetizers. While I shouldn't hold this against them, it makes me a little suspicious how they were able to take our appetizer order and get it out to us so fast... that being said, the waiting staff were attentive, and really I cannot fault them. The food however left much to be desired. The only words I can use are bland and tasteless, and that pretty much covers the whole repertoire of our order. We had the following:- Calamari - very standard as far as taste goes. It was the kind of dish you'd get at a beach bar for a snack and sustenance as oppose to look forward to as part of an evening meal. Fairly flavorless and unseasoned, and also lacking texture. Rice balls - probably the best dish of the meal, but still nothing to write home about. Soft and gooey, and exuding strong aroma of truffle when broken open; they're served with a marinara sauce that's slightly on the watery side. Again, bar food in standard. Simonetta pizza - supposedly topped with mushrooms and goats cheese, but lacking any flavour that would indicate the two. The only flavour I could genuinely taste was the black pepper I cracked on top of it. Special shout out to the dough and crust however, as the texture and bite really was great. Little Queens Pasta - this literally tasted like something you'd whizz together as a quick dinner after the gym. With pasta, broccoli rabe and sausage meats as the base the of the dish, that's literally what it tasted like. The bare bones of the three. No seasoning or extras to bind it or bring it together. The dish was oily and severely lacking flavor. Crispy sprouts - despite being served on a sizzle plate, there was nothing crispy about them. They were actually boiled, instead of roasted, so immediately they lacked any of that crisp texture. Again, nothing binder the dish together. It was just boiled sprouts, bacon and a handful of cranberries. Pains me to say it based on other reviews, but this place really was disappointing in my eyes. Only saving grace to give it 2 stars was the way the waiting staff carried them self. Avoid.
This place has potential but I never got my food. The inside is very cool and designed well. I ordered a hamburger; waited an hour and never received it. So I left. There are other restaurants in the area that are not as trendy but great. Good luck
"I've eaten here before and have always loved the food. What made me write this review was the poor service I received this weekend.  Now, it is one thing to receive poor service as a person of color and wonder if it because of your race. It is another to sit next to a white table and watch the server treat them better and give them extra stuff. That is what happened this weekend.  Jake, our server was strange/rude from the moment we went to be seated. I am not sure what was wrong, but he asked my friend and I which party we were. When we replied he looked like he hadn't heard us, so we repeated. He said ""I heard you"" and then just turned around and left. Like whaaaaat? Then we were sat next to a table where we had to repeatedly ask for water, where our food was brought to us but we were not given cutlery, where we had to track Jake down to ask for things. Meanwhile Jake is making nice with the white table beside us, bringing them plates of free cornbread. Not cool, Jake, not cool. Its also one thing to experience subtle racism at a white owned/operated business, but it is next level to get it at a Black-owned soul food restaurant in Bed-Stuy. It was very disappointing."
Went here on Thursday night for food and drinks.  I would definitely come back but most likely only to drink. They do have light bites for cheeses, meats, and sandwiches. The staff was really nice and we had taken the high top table for 4 of us, which was perfect.  Pros: Great atmosphere, similar to that of a speak easy with old glamorous mirrors, large chandeliers, fireplace,etc.  Cons: The food menu isn't very extensive and they are understaffed. I felt like they could have 1 more person on staff because there were only 2 splitting the drink and food orders.
This is for brunch. Food ranged for so so to horrible. We wished we avoided this place. I got eggs benedict. WTF is this? Regular bread, bacon is disgusting, and sauce was bland. See picture.  We were disapppointed with the baked egg with tomato and goat cheese. Taste like canned tomato sauce. The place and decor were great. But we were displeased by the brunch food.
It was so crowded that it was pretty unbearable. The bouncer was awesome. But between the crush of people and scorching heat from the fireplace I can't say I had a good time. Three stars because it seems like it would be cool if there were less people and if I was not directly in front of the fireplace.
Brunch is definitely not a good indication of a renown Italian place, yet L'Artusi managed to make it equally attractive. You would not be able to find that boring egg benedict, or French toast. Both my friend and I were egg lovers, so we went with the egg frittata and the scrambled egg. I did appreciate the fact that they were pretty generous in quantity and provided me half plate of fried potatoes, though I did not quite eat them...the scrambled egg with sausage was cooked slightly on the rare side and still maintained the soft texture. Loved it! Would love to, and almost have to come back for their pasta. Yet I would not mind coming back again just for another brunch!
Food wise, this place is pretty good. We ordered the short rib special and the paccheri pasta which were both very tasty dishes. The short rib was incredibly tender with strips of tender tendon running through the 1 inch thick piece of meat. It was served on a bed of farro along with roasted beets. The pasta was cooked al dente and was coated in an olive oil sauce with roasted Brussels sprouts and bacon.  So why 3 stars? First, I definitely felt that the pasta dish, while tasty, was missing a sweet flavor note. It was not interesting at all. Just...well done. Mostly, the 3 stars are for the fact that the service was terribly lacking. They took a while to give us the sparkling water we had ordered and the bread came very late. Additionally, one of the waiters dropped a knife on my shirt leaving a stain that I couldn't get off... Nothing was done about that by the way :(
Food and atmosphere was nice.   Their manager was a bit of a nut case.  He came over to us the first time to warn us about no liquor policy, so we kept that away.  We didn't do anything else except sit there chatting over beer, which we purchased from their bar.  He storms over to try to pick a fight, with the bouncer next to him.  There was a person explaining the situation--that we weren't drinking liquor.  Then the manager raged out wanted to kick him out and demanded an apology (he couldn't even tell us why he wants an apology).  Everyone was calm except him.  Even the bouncer felt that there weren't any issues. It's a chill spot as long as you don't get on the managers nerves over nothing, in which case he'll be out to get you the entire night.
Do not come here for dinner. The watermelon salad did not taste good and the sausage entree was terrible. In fact, the sausage fennel entree tasted like 5$ IKEA food.  The only good things were the filet mignon and mussels.
One of my favorite Italian restaurants in NYC. An intimate space with great, knowledgable staffs. Great selection of wine. The tables are a bit too close to each other, but thats most NYC restaurants.  - Grilled Octopus: 4/5 was great but nothing over the top - Linguine with Clams: 5/5 simple but memorable  - Beef Cheek Ravioli 5/5  - Grilled Pork Chop  4/5 - Banana Crostata 4/5
I used to be very faithful to Fette Sau, willing to make the trek out to Williamsburg from Sheepshead Bay at least once a month for some good meat. I got brisket and pork belly today, and for $29 and $25 per pound, this quality of meat was not acceptable. Both the brisket and pork belly were so dry and were VERY lean, with not much fat on either. The brisket had the consistency of beef that was boiled and the pork belly had the consistency of pork that was in the oven too long. Sadly, I feel like they wasted Angus Beef and Duroc Pork, and I feel like I wasted my money today (+ over 2 hours round trip). I've had good experiences with Fette Sau in the past, but after this meal, it gives me the impression that they do not take pride in their barbecue anymore. I hope they are not just concentrating on St. Anslem, since that restaurant is doing so well.
Food is great but the catering sucks when they had there own guy he would actually stay and help me setup the table without me even asking please bring that back because i love your food but that alone made my life way much easier.
Off the beaten path but a great spot for good affordable Thai.  What I love is that they have dishes that many restaurants don't have.  Good selection of soup and the great stand by pad thai.  I always want their mango soft shell crab.   Back in the day, they were tiny but now they also have a beautiful garden patio.  The service has gone down but the food is still reliable.
One of the best restaurants in Brooklyn. If you're in the area, you definitely have to give it a try. We've always come in starving so we opt for the tasting menu. You can request certain dishes to be included, and what kind of foods to avoid. Here is a brief rundown of what we got: (please note that the menu is always changing) 1) Amuse-bouche: chilled mint and pea soup - very refreshing 2) Braised short rib sliders, sweet potato fries, smoked paprika aioli - the sliders are pretty tasty, but weren't anything unique. The fries with the aioli were addicting.  3) Pork belly - I have a slightly unhealthy obsession with pork belly. But their version blew my mind. It's so greasy, fatty and heavenly. 4) Corn risotto with scallops - Delicious, fantastic dish. Scallops seared to perfection.  5) Strawberry-cinnamon glazed Berkshire baby back ribs - Very tender, the meat slides right off. The strawberries make it a cute dish. 6) Spicy bigeye tuna tartare on eggplant tempura - Amazing. I just can't. 7) Miso-glazed hamachi collar - this is the juiciest hamachi I've ever had.   8) Soft shell crab with avocado, pineapple, papaya - Hot, crispy, and delicious.  Lastly, the bacon glazed donuts with cappuccino ice cream. I'm a big fan of salty+sweet combination, so this dessert hits the spot.  Definitely will be back!
A bit pricey for what's offered - at least for my dish, which was just plain soba noodles with like 4 cubes of tofu (came out to like $17). The warm towels they give you to wipe your hands with is a nice touch though. So is the free pudding/flan dessert.
Being here for brunch and lunch, the food was  good both times, I won't go as far as saying exceptionally good but very good, the service was great when we went there for lunch but it was on a Friday around 12 in the afternoon and it was not crowded, the service for the brunch was decent and the place was packed( we found out that on the weekends the chicken and waffles were only served at dinner not during brunch). All in all a good experience.
"Oh peaches peaches peaches! Such good food, such good drinks, and such good pricing! I came here today at the recommendation of my friend. She's a yelper too and wanted to stay in Brooklyn for our outing. Peaches is one of the ""black owned businesses"" on the list that was sent to me by a couple of friends so I was excited to come see what it was all about. Not to mention the stellar reviews and mouthwatering pictures peaches has on yelp.  We found parking and walked in to a friendly greeter who asked us to write our names on the list. It looked as if there were three or four parties ahead of us but when she called their names out onto the street and no one appeared she told us we wouldn't have to wait and there were two seats available for us right in the corner. God was on our side because we were so hungry we were ready to eat our fingers.  We were seated in a tight tiny corner and were greeted by an attentive and cute waiter who asked if we had any questions about the menu. He informed us that happy hour was until seven and all the drinks were $5. I had seen the Ma Rainey drink pictures on yelp and knew for a fact that I had to have one.  My friend and I both ordered the hot chicken for $13 and each got a side of macaroni and cheese for four dollars both of which were to die for!! The chicken was well cooked and not too spicy and the macaroni and cheese was some of the best I've ever had. My friend agreed.  The service was great and the food was awesome I will definitely be coming back here to sample some more of the great variety they have on the menu! This place really is a gem!"
Pissed we get here and they have no stuffed crab, no roti and no jerk ribs...We drove from queens to basically get water...I swear only a West Indian joint runs out of their main food items...I will not be back and I'm telling my friends.
It's pretty much what every says below. Good food, good vibes. Small place, so hard to find seating but with the wait.  I highly suggest the ribs.
I'm not sure about all the five star reviews on this place.  Maybe my error was going for dinner instead of brunch.  However, after my experience I can't say I'm very inclined to go back at all.  Let's start with the positives, shall we?  This place is adorable.  The interior is very homey and there are tables outside as well which is perfect for a warmer evening.  The staff was attentive and service was fast paced but not rushed.  The house white wine was lovely, particularly at the price point.   Sadly the food left much to be desired.  We ordered the bacon wrapped dates, the croquettes, and the patatas bravas.  I honestly wouldn't recommend any of them.  The dates were passable with good flavor but the bacon was fatty and chewy.  The patatas were undercooked and some of the potato was starchy.  The croquettes were huge which meant you were essentially just eating lukewarm goat cheese.   I would give this one a pass- but perhaps with brunch you would fare better.
It's good to not fear the heat. Accepting spicy food transcends your body another level - just have tissues and cold water nearby. You'll be fine. I call this stuff happy food. If you're afraid of flavor, don't come here. You're lame. This place is totally awesome. Running back for more.
"Service and ambiance are really great, 3-4 stars there. but the food was literally worse than street food. so very unimpressed. the falafel was dry, the dips were unexcitable.  my friend got the beef torpedo and he was like ""this is a chopped up hamburger"" lol and then i got the numeric cauliflower soup and it tasted just ok. i had to add lots of salt to give it some oooomph"
A no-frills dumpling and noodle joint that really hits the spot. The decor... well, there isn't any. And the great service... well, there isn't any of that either. But if you're looking for delicious Shanghai style noodles and dumplings that are made to order: this is the spot! I always order the shanghai pan fried noodles and the steamed pork dumplings. The pan fried dumplings are also good but I find the steamed to be more moist. The menu is very simple. A two-sided laminated sheet has some pictures and the back is the list with prices. They come around and refill your hot tea for free which is nice if you don't order a beer. Cash only is the only downside
Cool spot, they've kept most things super traditional but there's a modern twist which is great. Really good portion sizes, definitely didn't need to eat breakfast the next day! Super friendly staff, definitely coming back!
One of my favorite seafood place in the city! The wait is usually about an hour or more but it's totally worth it. I usually get crab legs and shrimp with house sauce. They give it to you in vinyl bag and you have to eat it with your hands. Girls, don't forget to bring your hair tie because it gets super messy. Personally i think crawfish is not worth it since the meat part is so tiny!!  They don't take cash so take it out before you go. But if you forget, no worries bc they have it inside with like $3 charge to your card. Parking is another hassle but it's not impossible to find. It's pretty pricey so i would take out about $60 per person.
I've been wanting to try this place for a while since moving into the neighborhood recently. I came in alone on a weeknight -- it wasn't too busy, but it took a minute to catch the eye of a hostess or server, who guided me to an empty bar seat. I got the famous pork chop, which I'm a bit torn about. The meat is vast, tasty and well executed. It's served in a pool of au jus, which is nice because as you traverse the Porklandia of this chop, you will come across some drier bits that benefit from a dunk  in the juice. Other regions like the filet are moist enough to stand on their own. The sides are the main problem. The braised collards, which form a green, mushy bed for the chop, were inedibly salty. Perhaps they were salted when they were cooked and then absorbed more salt from the meat. And the onion rings seemed overfried, as the onions inside seemed to have evaporated into tasteless strings of cellulose. The staff were nice, but somewhat inattentive. Nobody told me about the specials going, and nobody blinked at the mound of uneaten greens on my plate. I'll probably give this place another try.
The service here needs an adjustment. If you hire servers that don't like dealing with people you'll get people leaving crappy. Ta-dah! What a new concept right?!  So we had the avocado toast which was tangy and had a nice kick to it although it's pretty simple. The carrot petit plate was ok.  The baked eggs with merguez were good overall. The eggs were overcooked where the yolks were fully cooked. It would have been better had they been a little more soft as I had baked eggs many times before.  The merguez was good. The usual spicey sausage to give the dish what it needs with the tomato sauce. The waffle was bland.  I think there are many places to go to so unless you're staying at the hotel and need a quick fix, go explore the surrounding joints in the MP district.
I don't understand why this place will rank 4 stars in yelp. The food is really terrible. The ramen is worse than $2 instant ramen you can buy at supermarket. And it's very expensive, it's about $40/person.
I think it's still hard to find a hipster asian fusion spot in NYC compared to Cali...so I was really happy to find this place.  It took about 25 minutes to get a seat since it was so packed but it was worth the wait....especially for the papaya salad (Best I've ever had).  They have a simple menu with a decent selection, the flavor of the food is not as intense and flavorful as I would prefer but it's still very tasty.  I'm still upset about Prosperity Dumplings moving from across the street, it was the only reason for me to ever visit this area...but Pig and Khao is a great addition to the neighborhood and might have me coming around here again.   Also: they played the most obscure hip hop songs I've heard played at a restaurant and that's always a big plus for me.  The food, music and overall vibe took me to another place.
"I've been here twice now and I just don't get the hype. The service is pretty bad. The servers never check on you and I feel like I'm inconveniencing them whenever I ask for something.  The food is not terrible but not what I was expecting from a place that's supposed to be the ""best Greek food in Queens."" The first time I went, I got the grilled fish. I'm all for letting the ingredients speak for themselves but salt is your friend. The second time I went I got calamari (again, in need of salt) and the grilled octopus. The char on it was overwhelming in some places, edging near burnt. This could have been a winner if someone had taken it off of the grill a few minutes sooner.  This wasn't the worst greek food I have had but definitely not the best. Considering that there's always a crowd, there are many better options in the area. Not worth the wait."
Went there for lunch. The food was below-average Indian food that you find in every other average Indian restaurant. I was really hoping to have some Bengali food which does not even on the menu. I'm totally disappointed. I could have gone to any restaurant across the US for this kind of Indian food. New York deserves better.
Some items on the menu are amazing (i.e., meatball sliders), while others are a bit of a miss.  Depending on when you go, the menu itself might not be too extensive.  For example, I took a friend there on a Saturday afternoon and was told that they have NEITHER their full lunch or brunch menu available.  Instead, we were given a small slapped-together list of some lunch and some brunch items.  While we were contemplating which of the appetizer-sized meals we wanted to stave off our hunger, the hostess appeared to grow impatient and came to take our order herself after we told a waiter we needed a few more minutes.  Look, I get it - the place is tiny and there were a lot of other people waiting.  But we waited our fair share of time to be seated and was simply trying to get over the nasty surprise of a limited menu ..which by the way, is not mentioned on their website or yelp page, for that matter.   The place gets packed, but does exude warmth and coziness depending on the company of strangers around you.  To be honest, you're more likely to bump into tourists trying to take pictures of every single corner of the restaurant (inside and out - thanks to Friends) rather than casual diners trying to enjoy low key vibes.   I went the first time for the experience and went back again to give the place a second chance.  Unfortunately, I doubt I'd be going back again a third time anytime soon.
I discovered this place by looking at gmaps near my friend's apartment.  All I knew was the name so I expected it to be some crusty old sailor dive.  Sadly, its not, but Sea Witch is still enjoyable.  There's a window where you can order tasty and affordable bar food.  The decor is a bit more modern than I was expecting and there is a perfectly fine selection of beers.  I didn't spend any time inside, instead heading straight for the back yard, complete with koi pond. It's a nice place to sit with friends.
It's not often that a meal leaves me speechless, but at least half of the restaurant week menu items had me literally pausing, savoring, and gesturing to my boyfriend how amazingly good it was. (As he eats the same thing and gestures back, yeah I'm eating it too?¿?¿ He doesn't understand.) The Restaurant Week brunch is $29 per person. You get biscuits for the table, an appetizer, mac n cheese and watermelon for the table, a main dish and a dessert. So. much. food. The deviled eggs for the appetizer might be the actual best thing I had. Who knew? Highly recommend. The dill and potato skin crisp thing on top really round them out. And the biscuits... oh my goodness, they transport me right back to the south but add a twist that I've never in my 22 years of living in Alabama had. If you don't go for restaurant week, you still MUST get these. Our main dishes were the chicken and waffles and the biscuits and gravy because, duh, more biscuits and more carbs. The chicken was cooked perfectly - not too overly crispy, not at all greasy, and a thick piece of chicken, exactly how I like it.  The banana pudding wasn't my favorite (Alabama still wins there) but it was still solidly good. The key lime pie dessert was really tart but actually really good. The presentation for every single dish was beautiful. I love a place that truly cares about putting out great dishes that look just as good before eating them. Root & Bone was basically completely booked on Open Table, but my psychotic stalking of the open times led me to finding an opening randomly one Sunday. But, upon arrival on Sunday at 10:30, half the parties in line didn't have reservations and there were plenty of open tables so, if you're in the area give it a try even if you don't have a reservation! Lastly... I would have probably given this place 5 stars if the hostesses hadn't been so rude to us when we said we didn't want to sit outside at the table by the dumpster with the 20 flies all over it. Interesting touch on what otherwise would've been an amazing brunch at an amazing place.
Really excited to have this new authentic Thai resto in our 'hood...makes for a fun eating adventure! The hub and I stumbled upon this place last weekend -- it was rather early on Sunday evening, so there were a few tables open and we figured why not?   As we'd not planned it, we didn't have any beverages with us (this place is BYO), but we did have cash (it was cash-only at that point, though they now take Amex --yippee!).  We tried two dishes on our initial visit -- Khao Soi Nuer and Mee Kati Isan.  The former came first and it was the standout.  The server had said it wasn't a very spicy dish, but that's all relative.  I suggest first trying it without mixing the dollop of spicy red sauce into the broth...it's got a nice heat level that way.  If you want it spicier, then mix it in.  Once we did so, my mouth was burning and my nose was running, but it was pretty addictive.  A solid dish that we deemed repeatable, despite feeling like the noodles were a tad overcooked.   Having the Mee Kati dish after the Khao Soi put it at a disadvantage as it couldn't match the dynamic flavors, partially because our mouths were already on fire which didn't allow appreciation of subtler flavors.  Again, we found the noodles a bit overcooked. We liked the place enough that we returned tonight (less than a week later), this time equipped to enjoy the BYO component.  It was 7/7:30pm on a Friday night and we were told the wait would be 45mn.  Thankfully we stuck closeby, as a couple seats happened to open up at the bar after about 20mn.  That is a very reasonable wait on a Friday night in Brooklyn! We got the Khao Soi again, as well as a new-to-us dish, Khoong Muk Kai Kem.  Our server this time called out that the first dish would be quite spicy, which we'd learned on our first visit.  It was consistently good, still a winner for us.  Unfortunately, once again, we were served the spicier dish first so it was difficult to evaluate the merits of the second dish.  We definitely liked it, though the calamari was a tad rubbery.   Bottom line:  the staff is friendly, but they need to be able to describe the dishes better -- simply telling us which part of Thailand it's from is not helpful unless you're already very familiar with the different regional cuisines of Thailand.  They also need to curate the order of the dishes so you're not eating a super spicy, super flavorful dish followed by a dish that's less so, as then that second dish is inevitably not as enticing/appreciated.   We'll definitely return, likely to repeat the Khao Soi and try something new.  This place has a promising future, for sure!
Wandering around looking for breakfast, my friend mentioned this was her favorite brunch spot. We popped in on a Saturday and just had the best timing. We snagged a table for two immediately. Within the next 10 minutes, several other groups wandered in looking for tables and had to put their name on a list that went up to 45 minutes! Ambiance: Cute place, lively. Very casual, but nice and clean. Definitely a nice looking brunch spot where you can expect excellent service and deliciously crafted food. Food: I ordered this poached egg dish with yogurt and chili oil and a side of toast. It was intriguing. Combinations I would not have put together myself, but was delicious. My friend ordered the same thing and we were quite content. The beignets were tempting, but I'm glad we didn't get them because we would have been too full. Service: Our server was attentive and friendly. No complaints! Price: Not too bad for NYC prices and serving size. Would I return? Yes! There's so much I want to try on the menu.
I had high hopes for this place but it wasn't that good. It could've been the burger that I had ordered but I'll give it another try next time. The Five Spice Duck burger was kind of dry. I like my meat juicy and I love duck but this burger just wasn't working for me. My friend had the Truffle Burger and he loved the garlic aioli sauce on it. We loved their thin truffle fries that's topped with truffle cheese and truffle salt. The fried pickles weren't working for me, the crust was too hard to enjoy. As soon as I bit into the fried pickles, the crust fell into pieces.  Overall, everything is good but it wasn't worth the wait for a table.
Good flavor and certainly bang for your buck (split the grand slam and it was more than enough for two people), but the sauce was pretty gloppy. Texture is important to me so I don't know that I could handle that again, haha.
I ordered my food 2 hours ago. This is unacceptable!! I had to wait on the line for 20 minutes for them to find my order, only for them to say they think it's being delivered. That was a half hour ago, and I'm still waiting. Seriously the worst customer service I don't understand how they are so disorganized
Barnjoo is an Asian inspired gastropub. Hubby and I went there with a TravelZoo voucher. They had a separate menu for this (which I understand, but dislike). We started with a soju cocktail which was lightly sweet. I love the ice with fruit frozen inside. Nice touch. We also shared: Tuna Mayo on toast (the garnish had a weird flavor) Nacho belly (a little too fatty) Soy and garlic wings (additional cost)-Super crispy but definitely needed a sauce. Truffle fries (additional cost )-really good, the best part of the meal Steak BBQ (small portion) Overall wasn't impressed by the Korean/BBQ portion, but would come back only for the bar food.
I will try any place that has soup dumplings so had to stop by this place during a trip to NYC. I ordered the spicy pork soup dumplings (order of four) and one of the chicken rice bowls. The soup dumplings were great. The skin was a little too thick, but the soup + meat inside was good and spicy, so it didn't bother me too much. They were also really fresh and came out piping hot. The rice bowl had a great flavor and comes with a decent amount of chicken - just wish there were more vegetables in the bowl as well. Overall, good place for a quick lunch!
Came here for a homegirl's birthday on a Sunday at 11. They don't take reservations so to ask for a table for 7 was an hour wait and that the hostess will text us when the table is ready. Fine. Still early we could grab a mimosa somewhere and come back. I mean hey, this is the meatpacking district right??  We come back an hour later because there was no sent text message. Hostess said she texted us. When verifying our reservation she texted the WRONG number.  7 hungry + tipsy girls who are native New Yawkers = cats ready to attack. The hostess quickly appeased her mistake by finding us a table for 6 and that it will be a tight squeeze. We agreed because luckily my friends are 90 pounds soaking wet. Cookshop should just rename itself to BloodyMaryShop. Honestly the best/creative bloody marys I have ever encountered. And I don't even like vodka but their bloody marys are incredible. I ordered the kale bloody mary which was surprisingly tasty. Do yourself a favor and order it WITHOUT the tumeric rim. Your hands will be a hot yellow mess otherwise. My friends ordered the pickled mary which I took a sip of and WASN'T too fond of. Why the f*ck would they add pickled onions to a bloody mary? I found the onion taste being too overpowering to enjoy.  As for the food: I REALLY wish that the service was quicker. My food was a lot colder than I expected. #FirstWorldProblem much? I ordered the huevos rancheros which were pretty tasty...minus the huevos part. The eggs were overly cooked for my liking. Not a huge fan of a non-runny yolk. The textures and crunch from the crispy tortilla + a lot of cheese + beans + cilantro + jalapeños = happy. The rest of my girlfriends ordered the burger which was mediocre at best. If I was to order the burger I would probably do without the cheese and have the meat shine through. The fries were delicious but once again not as hot as I wanted them to be. The star of this place has to be the french toast. WHAT IS IN IT?! It's so texturally innovative with all the nuts and dried fruit. First time I've ever had french toast that was baked instead of fried. It was fantastic. The portions are large so please come hungry. I think I would give Cookshop another shot, just next time with less people and would stick to the bloody marys & french toast.
"I'm going to give this place 3 stars. Honestly it's more of a 3.5 stars. That said, there is a lot of potential here. I mean A LOT. Keep in mind, while reading that I think this place has promise. It's new and I imagine they are still hammering out the kinks. Atmosphere The space is the perfect size, with a nice bar, decent mix of small and large tables. The music was obviously someone's iPod as people kept skipping the bad ones.  Staff There were plenty of staff around during our dining experience, but they still seemed a little wet around the ears. They were all trying and all very cordial. They just needed to be trained in the rhythm of the restaurant. Food We followed our servers recommendation and got the Crab Cake Appetizer with risotto. I followed with a Caesar salad (something I do everywhere), and we finished with the 12 ounce Wagyu Steak and the Catch of the Day. All were sufficiently tasty but you guys are all here to learn the truth so here it is. Drinks Took too long to get, but they were tasty. Crab Cake Appetizer Was pretty solid in size and flavor but the risotto lacked any flavor at all. Caesar Salad Almost successful, the dressing was fantastic. My problem was it was 65% croutons, 20% romaine, and 15% another parmesan type cracker thing. Left me wondering, ""Where's the Romaine kid?!"" 12 Ounce Wagyu Steak My steak was about 15 ounces and lacked the delicacy I expected for the ($27) price. The flavor profile was pretty good, but this was not what I expected from the cost. Perhaps a true 10 ounce delicately served wagyu would be better. The side was a pesto homemade gnocchi with pesto heirloom tomatoes, asparagus tips and mushrooms. It sound yummy, right? It wasn't, it was just boring mush. My vote is to go check this place out. The food is good. Support LIC, I will be back for brunch, lunch and dinner in hopes that this first date with Crescent Grill will lead to something that keep me interested."
Never had better tacos--even in San Miguel D'Allende. Indoors, but made to feel like you're having street food. Fresh ingredients and friendly service. Good alternative to fancy pre-theater dinner. Large portions. Earns its name, Numero Uno.
The lobster was juicy, succulent and buttered perfectly. The place is clean and it was fast. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because I expected more lobster for the price of $17.
Definitely love their dinner menu with interesting desserts. Lunch options are decent but mostly are sandwiches. Their food is always so fresh and taste good.  The only complain is Cash Only. But if that brings down the price, I wouldn't complain.
A small entrance on the sidewalk gives rise to a much bigger restaurant inside. They have a different, but pleasant take on miso. The rolls are made with just the right amount of oil, and their fried rice lunch specials taste great be they spicy or regular, with tofu of with chicken.
Was recomended this place by Japanese friend. The interior is nice and authentic, service is good too, but we were very disappointed with the food. We orderd Omakase menu, as it was our first time here and we wanted to try different things. We opted for $62 Omakase. I know the price is below average, but we definitely expected something more, and we left hungry. My complaint is that the service man couldn't explain clearly what is included into the menu. Moreover, he encoraged us to go for more expensive menu and said the quality gets better with the price, which is not fair in my opinion. Any way, $230 ( for 3) for what we had is ridiculous. Long story short, don't order $62 omakase, better get something a la carte. Don't think I'll be back here.
The food here has been consistently good. After a 3 year hiatus,  I finally found my way back to Amy Ruth's. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the food was just as wonderful as it'd been before.  The cornbread however didn't taste good. I was disappointed with the cornbread; they need a new recipe.
So happy they finally got a second NYC location! We had a 6 pax for lunch rush at 1pm. It was packed and one of their first days. It definitely took awhile to get seated, but the staff was all very pleasant and friendly. I got the Original Lobster Roll. It came with fries and a salad. It was pretty delicious, but a little too much mayo. Everyone in our group loved their meals and we will definitely be back soon! Welcome to the hood!
We ate there today and ordered several items.  The service was friendly but we will never go back. Every item was devoid of taste.  Nothing was bad but nothing had any flavor.  The spanikopita was soggy, the fish tasteless, the octopus, again, no flavor the three spreads, flavorless.  Meatballs were ok.  A bad day for the chef?   One problem which was surprising was that everything came on cold plates so every dish was tepid by the time it came to the table.  This is a rudimentary error for any restaurant.  For the amount we paid, we could have gone to Milos, or Taverna Kyklades (a lot cheaper) and had really tasty food.   Maybe a good place for drinks, pretty enough, but to eat there, forget about that; go someplace else.
"I just received the worst service ever here. The workers here are super rude. Also, my order was $21.23 & I gave them $21.25 and the cashier rolled her eyes and said ""I don't have 2 pennies and walked off to do something else. No ""I'll get some change"" or ""do you have change?"" I get that it's only 2 pennies, but don't be so rude!"
Super cute, very intimate cuban spot. Food is delicious and the service is friendly. A nice hidden gem in the Soho area. Highly recommend.
First time coming to black tap because last time I came the line was extra long and they said at least a 2 hour wait, so I left instead. I was looking at the shakes yesterday and it looked huge that's not something I could finish myself so I didn't get it. I got the milkshake instead it was still huge tbh had to take that on the go. Tastes like a regular milkshake, it was $8. The burgers we got was ok, we had the pizza burger $16 and the steak au pivore burger $17. Only thing I really liked was the fries but it was still good though. They have waiters there to serve us as well and they were nice. Pricing was average same as other places. Overall it could've been better the burgers.
Apparently there is a different chef at night I'll have to either come then ir try some other dishes. I had the vegetables and pad Thai and the pumpkin slider. To start I'll say the place is very new looking and the amenities are nice, the bathroom is clean, and service was very pleasant and fast. The food was a resounding meh. Nothing really crazy about the flavors or ingenuity. It was pretty cheap so that's always a plus. Just another fusion looking place trying to stand out. I'll try again
DO NOT COME HERE FOR BRUNCH. You will be extremely disappointed and you will be waiting an extremely long time to just get a glass of water
Dutch Fred's is an absolutely perfect spot for any event. The staff is so helpful, friendly and attentive. They accommodated our every request, even last minute, and helped make our private event a total success. Karol, their events manager, was especially helpful - from the first proposal draft to the night of, she was there for us for everything! The music, food and ambiance were all perfect.  Thank you to everybody at Dutch Fred's for helping us pull together an incredible, joyful evening at our party!
This place was so good!!!! The horchata cocktail was amazing. We split a salad (okay), the curry (so. Good.), and the ribs (yum). I will definitely be back!
Used this place as a pre-theater dinner and drinks spot with my partner. We were both very satisfied with out food and drinks but couldn't get over how poor the service was. Decorated like an old-timey NYC bar, this place has plenty of bar counter and tables to accommodate many patrons. My partner and I had a reservation for dinner and were seated very promptly but that was the only thing that was timely. I don't know if the staff weren't that good or if they were overwhelmed but there seemed to only be one server for most of the tables and the lack of interaction with each table really stood out. The cocktails are great and the prices are reasonable for being in the touristy/theater district. I was a huge fan of the Smoking Reverend ($14) which featured bourbon and and a red wine reduction. The food was hot and interesting and can be classified as gastropub-type fare. I was a fan of the duck confit spring rolls ($14) and the everything pretzels ($12). The spring rolls were filed with duck and came with two great sauces. The best part of the pretzels were the grain mustard and cheese sauces. There were many interesting menu items and the ones I had were executed perfectly. Overall, this place is a good option for a more casual cocktail pre-theater option. There were plenty of menu items to keep the pickiest eaters happy and there were plenty of delicious cocktails to choose from. If you can get over the lack of service, you won't be disappointed with this restaurant and bar.
Great drinks great atmosphere we went on a Sunday afternoon for brunch and waited only 15 minutes. We ordered a number of entrée dishes and everything was great although my hashbrowns and toast or room temperature my eggs however was warm and hot. My friend had the strawberry shortcake French toast which to be honest is so good to look at and tasted just as great it was sweet it was savory it was fresh. We also have a hibiscus agave margarita and Asoka sangria which were all great the hibiscus margarita took us to that point really quick so we ended up ordering two more rounds.all in all everything was great service could've been a little bit more faster but it's a Sunday in Brooklyn and everyone is going to brunch so I could understand why service was a little bit slow.
Best pizza and vegetable dishes in all of New York City!  Do yourself a favor and try a pizza and all the veg dishes.  You can thank me later!
Not really sure why this spot gets such high ratings... Food was quite a disappointment. On par with diner food. Had Mexican Cobb Salad special. Not special! Seriously, have had similar and much better with fresher ingredients at other spots for less money. My friend's salmon was standard. Veg was good, but corn app was starchy. Interior Super loud. Pros, happy hour extends to tables Nice outdoor and semi outdoor seating Nice servers
"I wanted to come here so bad during my stay in NY. Too bad, I was extremely disappointed. Our reservation was at 9pm, but 2/3 people arrived at 8:40pm and the hostess went ahead and sat us. The other person arrived at 9:02pm. All the while, our server kept rushing us. He came by the table 3 times asking us to order before the third guest arrived. After that, he came by immediately after she sat and came 2 more times. He berated us so much that we just ordered without being able to talk it over... Then he told us that the carbonara was out because ""we took too long to order."" Once our pesto gnocchi and tagliatelle came out, we asked him where the rose was that we had initially ordered, and he replied with ""at the bar"" in a snarky voice. He didn't apologize even though he clearly forgot the drink. I felt so uncomfortable the entire time we were in the restaurant because of that one server rushing us and making us feel unwanted."
"W. O. W.  In NYC, there's good ramen but then there's goooood ramen. Take a wild guess which one Ippudo falls under.  First of all, two words: chicken buns.  You're welcome.  Their menu offers a few different choices of ramen and even more choices of toppings. Including some recommendations of which toppings pair well with each ramen dish. They also offer a ramen ""refill"" so it's advised not to finish the broth if you're thinking of getting extra noodles.  Their drinks are relatively expensive so my friends and I usually split a bottle of wine, which usually does the trick.  The service here is always lovely, starting from when you walk in. There's almost ALWAYS a wait, so the hostess takes down your number and texts you fairly quickly when there's an open table. During this time, I recommend getting a liquid head start at The House of Brews across the street for cheaper drinks...  The only thing I strongly dislike here is their inability to pack leftovers to go. Sometimes I feel like I have to overeat just to get my money's worth and it's not a good feeling. Ether that or I leave without eating much and I'm left feeling like I just threw my money away (even though the food is amazing)!  Although takeout is a foreign concept at Ippudo, I still have to give them five stars because the food is just that good. Seriously."
The restaurant had a nice vibe and the waiter did come back often. There was a couple of draw backs.... my Food didn't come out together and I had to wait for condiments  my food was getting cold waiting. I had to wait for my Macaroni and cheese  ( it was worth the wait) it had good favor. Over all I would go back for the chicken and waffles with macaroni and cheese on the side
Had a really nice dinner, four of us. We order the Frito misto with a nice aioli, a few bites for each person. For dinner we ordered the spaghetti carbonara, lamb Filei, gnocchi with speck, and black ink fettuccini. All of them were excellent and properly proportioned. The gnocchi was a little on the small side but light and fluffy, like little pillows. The only complaints are that they wanted to seat us right next to the kitchen door when the place was empty, didn't keep our water glasses full, and they tried to clear our table completely, including our drink glasses that weren't even finished. The ambiance was great and the cost was very reasonable for NYC. The ginger beer was awesome too. Definitely recommend!
Great restaurant with nice food. We stumbled in for brunch one weekend and were pleasantly surprised by the décor and friendly wait staff. The restaurant is pretty spacious and accented with antiques. The food was good, but I am still unsure of the French-Korean fusion. The dumplings seemed to be the item with the most fusion but the only french influence I could detect was the lemon foam and tomato sauce. I suspect the dinner menu has more items with both French and Korean influences, so if that is why you are coming here, come at night. Other than that it was an enjoyable meal, I was just a bit disappointed because of the lack of fusion.
A wonderful concept but the final product is bland and disappointing.  Bao buns have been popping up everywhere in NYC and the world is better off for it. My favorite bao is found at Baohaus and I was hoping to find a competitor. They have a solid beer list and Korean alcohols I wasn't interested in. I ordered the fried chicken bao with daikon. They both turned out to disappoint. The fried chicken was crispy but didn't have much flavor and the daikon was also underwhelming without the sour bite I am accustomed to. The bao bun itself was a worthy rendition.  The server was nice and attentive but I can't strongly recommend the place. May try it again to see if I should order something else because godamn I love bao buns.
Great place for pasta and great place for a date. Came here on a Sunday night. No table but can still sit at the bar. The bar seats are actually very comfortable. Unlike the crappy bar stools and skinny bar tables, it was real comfy chairs and wide place.  We shared kale walnut salad. Pretty standard but note it was baby kale. Got cavatelli w/ sausage and pepper, pretty flavorful. But the Garganelli with mushroom ragú is what you must try! Rich mushroom flavor, chewy pasta, and just the right combination of ingredients. For dessert, I had Croiss bread pudding. Superb! The portion is large and good for two to share.
Lazy to write a long descriptive review, but in a nutshell, yawn. Went with a veg friend and ordered the Zucchini Pancakes (under-seasoned), Quinoa Salad (kept looking for the quinoa in there!) Plyllo Rolls (wayyyy too salty) & Roasted Eggplant (C'mon, this is an easy one to get right!). Simple stuff but rather unimpressive. Sad, for some reason I had expected much more from this spot.  Maybe I'll go back to give them another chance on the meats....
Went here for brunch. The food was good but the size of of my $24 piece of salmon was so small I couldn't believe it. Also, we sat down and it took a very long time to get our food. I guess they were fishing the salmon out of the river because we waited over 45 minutes for that tiny piece of fish to show up.
the beef curry. so good. and food comes out quickly!
My boyfriend and I went for happy hour + dinner. Their short ribs were ABSOLUTELY bland, though their pickled veggies that came on the same plate saved the day. It was un(der)seasoned short ribs sitting on top of a tasteless white sauce served with bland jus. Do not order the short ribs. Seriously. Bad food breaks my heart and this just tore my heart to shreds. We also got a caesar salad and their famous mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was good, but nothing to write home about. Their salad had an unusual twist and was served with a spicy oil drizzled over the top- I didn't hate it.  Their happy hour cocktail was boring, but their wine list was pretty comprehensive. If you are going for just wine and cheese- go for it. I'm sure you'll be happy. If you're looking to grab dinner or if you're looking for an interesting happy hour spot, look elsewhere.
"I've loved Marcha since they first opened and I was one of the first clients to visit and write a raving review on  . I even celebrated my bday brunch at Marcha a year and a half ago. I've recommended them to many people and never had a bad experience especially with their customer service. Sadly, today I had a completely opposite experience.  On 1/17/15 I went on seamless web to place an order at 2:24pm. I called around 3:10pm just to see if the order had gone out (I was hungry and had to leave my house earlier than expected). The person that picked up checked my order and said that unfortunately I had ordered the ""coca"" which is a menu item they don't offer at that time but that the chef would could make an exception and could make it for me. I proceeded to tell him that no one had informed me and that it was on the menu as an option. He said that wasn't his fault and I proceeded to say I understood, but it's not the customers' fault either and I asked if the chef was definitely making it and how much longer would it be. He said ""maybe 4-5 minutes but I'm not sure unless you'd like to cancel your order."" I told him if it would only be a few minutes and then it would go out for delivery then it would be fine. He proceeded to tell me that he didn't know and that I could call back in 5 minutes to check on the status or I could cancel. Throughout the conversation he was being condescending and speaking to me in a very bad tone. I asked to speak with the manager and he said ""I'm the manager."" I said ok...what's your name? (I've met the manager before which I assume was Jairo so I was perplexed and couldn't believe he was being so unpleasant). He proceeded to tell me that he didn't have to provide his name and that he owned the place and was his own boss. I then ask him to cancel my order and called seamless immediately for a refund.  I was honestly shocked by this experience and won't be recommending Marcha. I just hope others don't have a similar experience. It's a shame to see this happening."
"It really hurts me to give this place one star because there was one guy working who was so nice and attentive. How is this rated a 4 based on food?? I have no idea. We got the roti canai as an appetizer and It was good but the sauce that comes with it was watery and not good at all. I had the pad see ew and my friend had the pad thai. Presentation is a 0. It looks like someone cut up the food and served it. I was not impressed. Every restaurant should know you eat with your eyes first, not to mention the bowl was chipped and looked like it took a beating in the dishwasher. The food didn't agree with me at all, and I mean it was far from good thai. My friend's pad thai did not look appetizing so I did not bother trying it.  The inside looks dirty... they really need to step it up. The ""B"" rating doesn't reassure the fact that they are clean. When you walk inside the bathroom which was not clean you can see the kitchen and ""cleanliness situation."" The outside is nice and inviting, the inside not so much. You can eat with your dogs outside, but I think there is SO MUCH BETTER PLACES TO EAT. Overall I would not return I did not like the food. Our waiter did not really understand us very well....I also did not like the fact that the ""free check in thai tea"" was watered down and did NOT TASTE GOOD. I drank it because the aftertaste of the food was so strong I did not like it.  Really not worth it. You can get cheaper, along with cleaner and better quality elsewhere.   Sorry but Love Mamak did not do thai food justice!"
"Do you have 4 hours to spare for dinner? If so, come here.  From getting seated, it took about 15 mins to place our order and I that's with flagging the waiter down.  It took 45 minutes from when we places an order to get a salad.  And even then, the waiter had to ask us ""what did you order again?"" and just set it down and walked away. The free ""empanadas"" for a Yelp check in are micro empanadas the size of quarters.  Don't even bother.  50 minutes later, we were served room temp food. Really, after all that you can't even give us hot food? Has it just been sitting there this whole time? Food was mediocre, not worth what we paid for. Looking around, all the other tables are twiddling their thumbs also wondering where their food is. One word: hangry.  Never again."
absolutely did not meet my expectations.  food is not tasty and rude. they replaced the part of my order did not ask me. i really was frustrated and do NOT recommend this place
My BF brought a groupon deal for Calle Ocho, $75 for a 3 course meals for two. Also, if you check in on yelp you get a free glass of Sangria (red or white). My bf got the red and I got the white. I highly recommend getting the red ! The red was sweet and fruity but not overly sweet. But if you like your sangrias strong then I would recommend getting the white.  For appetizers we ordered Gallitos for two (Platter of Traditional Costa Rican Soft Tacos with grilled beef, Salsa Verde Shrimp & Chipotle Chicken). Definitely serves more than two. I would say it can probably serve about 3-4 ppl. Half way into our appetizers we were getting full. For entrees, my bf ordered Vaca Frita al Caballo (Cuban skirt steak, latin pork fried rice, fried egg and avocado) and I ordered the Paella (Lobster, mussels, clams, shrimp, chorizo, chicken, valencia rice, tomato-calamari salad). The Paella was good but didn't WOW me and the rice was a bit oily. The Vaca Frita Al Caballo came with a HUGE portion of rice and 2 long pieces of skirt steak. The latin pork fried rice was surprisingly good and the steak was just mediocre. A touch of more seasonal would've helped. We literally took a few bites of the entrees and ended up taking both the appetizer and entree to go.  For Desserts we ordered Tres Leches (Traditional pound cake soaked in 3 milks, filled with pineapple and coconut and pineapple coulis) and Caramelo (Traditional Vanilla Flan in mango sauce). Both desserts weren't bad nor good. It was just ok.    Overall, with the groupon deal it was definitely worth the price. Their portions are perfect for family style. This was worth a try and would love to come back for a pitcher of red sangria.
Great Greek food!  Be prepared for a long wait especially during dinner time on weekends but it's worth it.  We prefer the Astoria location to the one in Manhattan somehow.  Great lunch deal.  Always get the fried cheese, pita, sauces! lemon potatoes, grilled squid (calamari style is just too normal), chicken kababs.  We also tried the baby shark once but it was really dry. I'd keep coming back for the grilled squid and lemon potatoes.
I went in to grab an order to go,... the girl taking my order seemed like she hated working there ,... really bad attitude and rude,... the food was ok but as good as it used to be the chicken was very dry and their sauce is getting spicier by the minute ,... you guys have to put a friendly cashier
Authentic mexican food, but perhaps my expectations were too elevated based on previous reviews.  We ordered the guacamole, pollo a la parilla, enchiladas verdes, and flan for dessert.  Average service.  Slightly overpriced.  I prefer Casa Agave just down the street.
Been trying to go to L'Artusi for a year or so since going to sister restaurant Dell'anima. Wow am I pissed I didn't get to L'artusi earlier. This place is on point.  First off the restaurant itself is very cool. Awesome open kitchen setup. We sat upstairs outside of their incredible wine room which actually has a ~10 person private dining table in it. Loved the setup. Our waiter was very nice and incredibly knowledgable. Knew the ins and outs of their seafood procurement and their wine list. Even the guy who bussed our table knew how they made the preserves on the cheese plate. Impressive.  We started with a fantastic bottle of wine. As well as two cheeses (came alongside these delicate umami buttermilk crackers which were to die for). One was the ezra from murrays cheese shop which was delicious.  Next we got the raw scallop crudo style which was one of the most delicate scallop preparations I've ever had. Melt in your mouth status. As well as the beef tartare which was a special. It came on some awesome dark bread and was full of garlic intensity. Both apps were superb.  Next we got the burrata with heirloom tomatoes and nectarines and the chicory salad. The burrata was so smooth and delicate and the tomatoes and nectarines were very fresh. The chicory salad took us by surprise with its anchovy BOOM. I mean anchovy as hell. If you don't love anchovies don't get this. Luckily I love me some anchovies. Yum.  Lastly we each got a main. The chicken, the bolognese tagliatelle, the rabbit gnocchi, and the lamb ragu pasta. Everything was amazing. The chicken was salty and crispy with vegetables. The bolognese tagliatelle was meaty and unctuous. The ragu was homey and dense and delicious with tender chunks of lamb. The gnocchi was like clouds of perfectly delicate potato. Overall the service was great. The atmosphere was great. The food was top notch. Every dish was crafted with the utmost care. The staff was very well educated on the fare and the libations. You can tell when care is put into the meticulous creation of a concept and it translated into the perfect experience.  We will most definitely be coming back here, many times to come.
First off this place only accepts cash. Also a 15% service charge was added to the bill and I was dining by myself.  I am shocked at the reviews for this place. I should have known what I was in for when I walk in and noticed that only 8% of the patrons were Asian. In a place like Chinatown, follow the Asians for the best authentic place to eat.  Ordered the soup dumplings since so many people raved about it. I thought the outer dumpling skin was thick and you had to chew at it to break through. However the soup and meat inside did have a nice flavor.  I also ordered the Shanghai Noodle Soup with flat noodles. I am sure this is a regional dish but it looked like beef Lo Mein. The soup looked like a gravy abut it was oily and it should have been more flavorful. The shredded cabbage and spinach was fine but I was disappointed.  If in Chinatown for the day go somewhere else and enjoy a more authentic meal.
I made a reservation for my girlfriend's birthday a few weeks in advance. Today when I called them to confirm the time before I go since it has been a while I did not recall it is 6pm or 7pm. The lady who picked up my phone said she cannot check that for me even I provide my full name and phone number. She was speaking in a extremely rude way. She refused all the possible solution to it like checking on the computer and call me back. This restaurant is overall pretty arrogant! They did not take credit cards in the 21st century. Ok, keep your arrogance and neither me or any of my friends or family will waste their time and money with you!
Like others have all mentioned, it's good and simple food. Nothing dramatic, not a lot of flare, but pretty a pretty solid meal that's reliable. The place was incredibly packed though, even for a Wednesday lunch.
This place in insanely loud!!! I don't know how anyone could have a conversation while they are at this place. I could hear the music over a block away before I got to the place! Also, how can you have burgers and not serve fries??? I had gone early in the day once because I was craving a good burger, and left without buying anything because ummmm no point in having a burger and no fries!
Benemon is a quaint little dine in restaurant with many different options for rice bowls. I came here with my boyfriend and we got the Curry Katsu Don and the Yaniku Don. The curry was great! I was a little surprised when it came out because the pork was more like nuggets than a filet, but the meat was tender and there was just the right amount of crunch. The curry was flavorful and sweet. The Yaniku Don was really sweet, but the portions were a little small. The dish came in a bowl with high sides so it seemed even smaller. My boyfriend left hungry, but the quality of his food was great. Service was very fast. Our food came out within 15 minutes of ordering. We will definitely be back!
I have no idea what was ordered for brunch but i do remember the unlimited mimosas and sangrias.  This review is for our server Joy, who was not joyful whatsoever. Rude at the very best.
So my parents have been going to Barbuto and loved it. We decided for the first time to bring our dog who's about 5 pounds and a service dog. I usually understand when restaurants get upset about me bringing my dog, however this was a different story. The lady told us to move our dog cause she was lying on the floor a little bit away from my chair and we moved her but I was a little hesitant to move her so i asked if we had to because i didn't want to push my dog cause she was fine where she was. After moving her, she then went over to almost every other server and ranted to them about how rude i was and pointed to me when describing it. Like i get it, you may be a little annoyed, but you don't need to tell everyone about it and make me feel uncomfortable. They were extremely nasty and rude to us the rest of the time. The food was ok but not great.
Got the burger and it was really good, although a little Overcooked. My wife got the steak and eggs. Service is friendly but not overly attentive or would have given a better rating.
It's all right. I mean it's just meatballs + a random assortment of things that meatballs can go with. Past, sandwich, cheese, various toppings, etc. In the end you're only as good as your meatballs and they were pretty small and not as flavorful as what I hoped it would be. I'm a big IKEA Swedish meatball fan and the meatballs at The Meatball Shop absolutely gets killed in a head to head comparison with IKEA so I have to rate according. My friend got meatball sliders and they weren't even meatballs. They were more like mini-patties.
Honestly, this is among the best ramen I've ever had, competing with my favorite spot in Houston (Jinya).  First off, you must be patient. Ippudo is known to have outrageous wait times, and I have had to wait upwards of 1 hour to grab a couple seats. Today, I arrived early before the dinner rush and only had to wait 6 of the 20 minutes that was estimated. I ordered the Karaka-men, the spicy option on their menu. The broth is flavorful and not overpowering. The spice is adequate to satisfy the hardiest of spice tolerators and possibly hot enough to make the less tolerant a bit uncomfortable. The noodles themselves were beautifully cooked, with and almost Japanese-al dente texture, if that is a correct term. The waitstaff is friendly and courteous, which is a welcome addition. Admittedly, it is pretty pricey for a bowl, so don't expect to come here every night for a decent helping. However, the portions are huge and you can expect to receive a fair amount of food for what you pay.
I've always heard about this place so I tried it out. Upon arriving, I noticed the restaurant's decor - very cute and clean. We came on a day that wasn't busy at all so we were seated right away. I ordered the Eggs Benny ($16) which is 2 poached eggs over potato latkes, smoked salmon, with beet hollandaise sauce and Fresh Cantaloupe Juice ($6). When the order came out, the entree was A LOT smaller than I had expected. I thought it was a joke, but once I started digging in, I was content. The food itself is really good and filling. After finishing my meal, I was satisfied. My eyes are definitely bigger than my stomach. The juice was very fresh and worth it. Overall, the food was good but definitely too overpriced
Looked this place up on Yelp for happy hour and it appeared to be a solid hit, but was very misleading. Only one drink special for 10 bucks....no other drink discounts. 8 dollar snacks when they really should have been called nibbles. Ordered six oysters and at least four of them had shells pieces that would be a choking hazard for any adult who doesn't enjoy spitting out bits of food into their napkin. Shrimp tacos were a hit, three per order, so my date and I had to awkwardly split the final, siracha mayonaise covered, corn tortilla. 80 bucks later we were kinda buzzed and wholly unsatisfied. 9 out of 10 would not go again.
This was my second visit to Upstate and I have to say that it's good but not great. The first time, I ordered the tartare and the second time I went for happy hour and ordered some oysters (all east coast) and the cioppino.  Having just visited San Francisco, I am all about cioppino. I expected a rich flavorful broth with a mix of delights from the sea. What I received was a bowl of tiny mussels with a clam, bland fish pieces and a prawn head. While I appreciate the effort they place on letting the seafood speak for itself, cioppino is traditionally well seasoned. I do see why this is a favorite in a city like NYC though. The pricing is very attractive and the food is fresh. My cioppino was filling and priced at $18. Nothing on the menu is above $18 and all the food is seafood. I may come back one day but I would never wait more then 10 min for a table. Especially since there are other wonderful restaurants nearby.
Thai Villa is absolutely beautiful inside from the entrance to the bathroom. The service is impeccable. I met up with a good friend of mine for dinner around 6 with the after work crowd. Regardless of the many patrons, the waiters and hosts were giving personalized service. The prices are comparable to affordable Thai spots, def worth it.  First off, we ordered Singha draft beer from Thailand. To wet our palate, we were given a complimentary Ma hor (minced pork & peanut ball over pineapple) which was rather satiating.  Then, we given a run down of the special entrees which I believe is a great gimmick used to convince you to buy the more expensive items off the menu. Refusing to be charmed, we ordered an of appetizer steamed vegetable dumplings and calamari. For the entree, the traditional Pad Thai and Hor Mok Talay.  Steamed Vegetable Dumplings- gorgeous blue exterior w/ sesame seeds yet a bland vegetable filling that required the tasty sauce included. Calamari- portion size could be increased. Some of the best calamari I've had beside my own. They were fried in a uniquely seasoned batter with a dope dipping sauce too. Chicken Pad Thai- proportionate ingredients with the right amount of peanuts added. Chicken was subpar.  Hor Mok Talay- aesthetically pleasing with the coconut shell and robust filling. The interior had a subtle coconut sauce with well seasoned seafood (prawns, Crab meat, etc.) plus perfect jasmine rice to accompany it.  In the city, hungry for Thai, go check it out. Duhh!
Bulkogi box was the right amount of food for lunch, but the soup stole the show. Also, how can you serve korean food WITHOUT KIMCHI........
Ciabatta bread hard af ran out of Benedict Jenny weren't willing to sub salmon. Nice server. Cold so bring a sweater. Home fries were delicious but salty. Benedict lobster was delicious, spinach was a nice touch. Free Bellini but already paid for with the high prices. French toast was good but nothing special.
Extremely slow service. Still here waiting about an hour later and our food has yet come. Totally unacceptable, watching other people who came way after us getting their food. Don't come here hungry.
This is a really cute bar! I was meeting a friend for holiday drinks and she suggested this spot.  The bartenders are as attentive as they can be as this is a very busy place. The drinks are good and it isn't overly expensive. I would definitely come back.
"I will start off by atleast saying this places food is great. I loved it.  However everything else was awful... The service wasn't great. My food was 15 minutes late just because our waiter forgot to put in my order. My party was done by the time my food arrived. Also they have this great idea called ""1 table 1 check"" ... So when you have a group where everyone is paying separately you have to sit down and use your calculator to separate everything amongst your party. Such a good idea... And our bill was wrong which also made this splitting experience difficult... Don't know if I'm coming back."
I am giving a generous two stars. The waitress was very sweet and the room was a big, open, bar room. We were one of two tables eating dinner on a Sunday night and it took a long time to receive our food. And unfortunately I am with the yelpers who got the dry meat. We ordered pulled pork and the ribs that are supposed to fall off the bone. All the meat was dry and chewy. It did not seem fresh. The sides: beans, sweet potato fries, coleslaw and mac & cheese were just ok, but nothing was a standout. Cornbread was our favorite item. It's very sweet. We were hungry, ate what we could, settled the check, left and don't plan on returning. There is so much exceptional bbq in NYC that I would not waste my time or money here again. Good for those who loved the food. It's hard to believe one place could have such a range.
"Dishonesty business practice with salty overpriced mediocre food quality. - $17 for a fava bean salad -  20% tips charged on total instead of subtotal -  When asked how much the special entrees were, the manager told us ""not expensive and under $20"".  However when the bill came it was NOT the case -  Food was salty I wouldn't even recommend this place to my enemy.  You eat at your own risk."
Not entirely sure why this place is rated so highly. Came here on a Sunday night around 7pm - wait time was around 10 minutes to get seated. However, the food took ages to arrive. I ordered a kimchi fried rice while my friend had the Tonkotsu. Hers came out in ~10 minutes, mine took ~25. So it was really awkward spending 35 minutes watching one another eat!! The fried rice was great! Ramen, not so much.
Fun experience and a good steak but i don't think the steak is anything special. If it's your first time coming here (especially if it's a thurs/fri/sat evening) expect chaos. Walking in to Peter Lugers is like walking in on the fall of Rome. People are crammed into the bar area and various other nooks and crannies, ducking trays of sizzling food and drinks being carried by waiters left right and centre. Despite all the chaos, the maitre d' and the other hosting staff are courteous, welcoming and organised. They do their best to honour reservation times but there will in all likelihood be a little lag-time. Hence why the bar area is so crammed. A cynic might be tempted to opine that this is an intentional ploy to get a captive audience to buy a few rounds of drinks at the bar while waiting for their table, but i honestly do not think this is (entirely) the case; perhaps just a happy byproduct. But all in all, it's fun, it's loud, it's chaotic... it's almost a microcosm for New York. Have a drink, chat to the people also waiting around you. The service is superb - slick (not talking about hair style although...), efficient and friendly. The bread (not sure if it's complimentary of if there's a cover) is nice enough and if you're starving will tide you over till starters/mains arrive.  Bacon - order the bacon. Seriously even if it's just one to share between two of you. Order it. it's something between a pork chop and a great thick piece of bacon. Don't even deliberate. The steak, here is where i just don't get the hype, and i realise that there really must be a massive degree of subjectivity in this or else people are just being a bit sheep-like. Don't get me wrong it's a perfectly ok steak, and i've seen foodie documentaries on their unique technique of double cooking it by searing it and then finishing it off in the oven, but the end product was very underwhelming. It only had a little bit of crispy, char, and it was a little bland. I've had dozens of steaks in NY, but my favourite by a country-mile is Sparks. Its sirloin is the tenderest with a perfect, all-encapsulating, crispy, salty char. I have never once even looked for the salt shaker, or added any sauce. It's also the only steak i've ever had where i eat the lumps of fat, because they just melt. The steak at Lugers was the exact opposite -- the fat was hard and inedible (i had to spit it out), it had minimal char, and i constantly had to add salt. It was definitely tender and buttery but it just lacked any wow factor and i could definitely taste the dry-agedness in a bad way. The above could sound massively critical but it is just to differentiate. As i said at the beginning it is a perfectly good steak i just don't think it's worth all the accolades, when (depending on taste buds) there are better options out there.
The overpriced milkshake was good, but the service was horrible. When we got in restaurant, the first thing the guy says after he asks us how many are in our party is 'you either have to split up or go outside.' Mind you, it was raining. I get what he was saying but it came across rudely. It took 5 minutes for the bartender to acknowledge us, after she casually chatted with other customers. After we got our shakes, the bartenders proceeded to ask the other customers how their food and drinks were, ignoring us. I pondered why we were receiving such poor service, and I realized the only difference between my group and the other customers was our race which is black. We won't be going back.
Unfortunately , I have come to the point where I need to review my first note. After having been somewhat glad with our first experience at brunch time, we were not happy at all the second time for dinner. And we brought guests who were trying this place for the 1st time. It was expensive for what we had as portions are limited and not that large. The quality is certainly present but the cooking has to be improved. All of our meat didn't have proper temperature , based on what we asked. And the steak temperature for the 2nd time was overcooked. We had a final bitter taste with the check. We'll pass for a while.
Bad service, there were 6 of us and one person didn't get their food until 30 minutes after everyone else. The food was over cooked and not good. The pad Thai was not good... wondering why this place has 5 stars
Review based on overall experience.  Came in for lunch and a beer.  I went to order the burger based on the help menu I noticed that they upped the price on everything the burger is up a dollar and all the add one are 2 dollars now so...  When I went to order it the bartender told me that it would be 17$ and fries would be 8 dollars more... Huh $17 doesn't get me side of fries.  The food was mediocre at best and the fries were served to me in what looked like a doggy dish.  Staff attention was non existent.   Skip this place plenty of better gastro pubs close like boundrants (much better)
I saw all good reviews so was really surprised. I ordered late night so that might have had something to do with it, but the bowl was inedible. Had to throw it away :(
For the large format Ribeye for 3-6 people, 3 Stars. For me the ribeye, although really beautifully presented and very flavorful, at $250 for a serving for 4 people (at most, if more than that 4, order some appetizers) is not a good value even if it includes caesar salad and fries for everyone. For that kind of money, it should be as good or better than a standard NY Steakhouse, like say the Old Homestead. The appetizers, which we had scallops and the duck dumplings, were outstanding, and this makes it 4 stars. Wine selection is decent, but not enough lower end offerings. Service was very good, knowledgeable and attentive. It can get a bit loud, if you don;t mind that. For $100+ a person steak meal, you could do better in a traditional steakhouse. We'll be back for the appetizers, though.
Excellent food, modern Italian restaurant , friendly staff , excellent wine selection ,
Not bad for average go-to ramen lunch spot in FiDi. Food comes quick so you can have ramen within your hour break. It's really small so it'll be hard to get seats if you go during lunch rush hour.  I always get the kuu chilli chilli  ramen and it's always just satisfactory. Their Japanese fried chicken is pretty good too - good for two people if you're both getting an entree!
Our food didn't have much flavor, the prices where super high, the wait was almost an hour and a half, our table was ooberly cramped, the atmosphere was fun, the staff was friendly... wont be going back. The pasta was homemade, you could tell, but it was overly cooked so it felt mushy.  I think they could focus on appetizers and drinks instead of trying to give a full dinner service experience.  I don't think the kitchen, the staff, or the space allows for a full 3 course, or even 2 courses.  They have a hit with their bread and olives... and the wine, but the food doesn't seem to get many props (with the exception of the homemade pasta which I experienced and didn't enjoy).
5 Stars for the location 5 stars for the guy cleaning rain off the tables 3 stars for the counter girl 3 stars for taste 1 star for value 1 star for blandness 0 stars for portion size = 3 stars
Don't get the duck!  I had a really disappointing experience here - I ordered the duck with fennel, cherries, potatoes and spinach.  I love duck and cherries, so I was excited to eat them together.  When the dish arrived, the cherries were nowhere to be seen.  I asked the waiter, and he advised that the menu was wrong and in fact it came with plums, not cherries.  There were a few tasteless cubes of plum on the plate, which didn't add anything to the dish.  I expressed my disappointment and he didn't react.   The duck and fennel was cooked nicely, but the spinach was so salty it was inedible and made me feel slightly sick.  I was very surprised that they billed me the full amount for the dish ($28), especially after I made it clear that I was disappointed and didn't eat half of it.  Having said all that, the stuffed squash blossoms and the clam pasta my girlfriend got were tasty - it's just such a shame that the duck dish was so unappetizing.
Service was impeccable.  My waitress, I believe Diane, was amazing. She recommended the minowamon kimote sake which was clean and super smooth - perfect for sake newbies. It went down so easy and couldn't believe it was alcohol running down my throat. It was absolutely the best choice for us and I'm so glad she knew exactly what to get us. Not to mention, she was super attentive and filled our shot glasses whenever needed. She also picked up our jackets when they fell on the side. Seats here are very limited and I had to sit side-to-side with my friend which is not usual for me, but I didn't mind.  Ramen is good! We had the tantan ramen which was creamy and thick. It got a bit too heavy towards the end, but it was warming and hearty, especially yummy for a rainy day.  Shout out to the kakuni bao! I usually hate the fat part, but it melted in my mouth so I didn't mind. I have to say it's a bit weird that they put cheap iceberg lettuce in my bao, but it worked. Also, the tuna from zuke don was super fresh and very well-seasoned. i was super satisfied with all the food there.
Setup is tiny and options are minimal (I like), but the flavor just wasn't there. I had eggs over easy, cheesy grits and a biscuit. Not memorable at all. My food was bland and flavorless. The biscuit was like a brick as well. Very dry and crumbly. My friend had the sprout toast with eggs and a side of home fries. He thought his meal was different but still enjoyed it. We both were eyeing the catfish and wish we had ordered that. If I go back, I'll get that. If not, not pressed.
Drove all the way here for Joju from Brooklyn with my boyfriend. Not the easiest to find parking as it's located in a pretty busy part of elmhurst. We got the kakuni pork belly sandwhich with an runny egg and kimchi fries. The sandwhich is huge, definitely recommend sharing as it is quite heavy. The pork belly is cooked to perfection and melts in your mouth. The runny egg adds a really nice touch to the sandwhich. The kimchi fries were amazing, slightly spicy with spicy mayo and kimchi.. great combo together. Their viet ice coffee is pretty good too, overall love this little spot!
Are we supposed to be honest when waitstaff checks on you, after meal is delivered and patron has had a taste of it? I didn't want to tell staff that the 6-hour Short Rib was too salty for me to enjoy it. I tried eating it, along with the seemingly unseasoned mashed potatoes and honey-glazed carrots which lost its glaze in the mashed potatoes.  In my opinion, the mashed potatoes should've been served in a ramekin and carrots on the side of the short rib. My friend ordered the Chicken & Pancakes topped with it's special bacon and maple syrup. That looked delicious. Also, they give you a bottle of Molasses Maple Syrup to pour on top of your food.  Imo, you don't need extra syrup of any kind. The Pancakes were real sweet like you're eating dessert. Though, I didn't try the chicken but it looked beautifully battered and cooked. To drink, I sampled 3 beers to figure out which one I wanted. I gave up and blindly ordered the Hudson Bourbon Peach Tea. Bourbon was the predominant flavor in the tea, second is peach flavor. Tasted a bit like summer. The one item I'd like to come back for is its Biscuit Bread Pudding. Judging by the photos, it looks scrumptious and huge. I'd like that with a cup of coffee.
Currently ending best friend day with my best friend here. Dinner has been lovely so far. Everything came quickly. The service is amazing. We're now planning to bring our boyfriends back here with us. SoCo for the win!!! I highly recommend this place. The food is delicious and the So-Colada is soooooooooo yummy. I love coconut
Big yuppie bar with no soul. None. Nicw space and location, but soulwise, you might as well be ar the airport bar. Blah.
Food is not as good as it once was. Ordered delivery and it arrived quickly, that was the only good part. Noodle soup broth lacked any depth and was heavy on star anise. Pork chop portion was half  the size that I'm used to. Dumplings were all meat and needed seasoning. Fried noodles were tasteless and gummy. I'm super disappointed.
"Brutal service. Been meaning to try this place for a while. We made a dinner date reservation for 2 at 8:30, when we arrived at 8:27 we were told ""Oh, I just gave your table away."" WTF?! There was a small table that was empty but we were told that it was ""reserved."" He then offered a couple bar stools tucked tightly between tables and the window. Not interested in having an uncomfortable dinner at a non table, we decided to leave. On the way out we let him know that we were disappointed that he gave our table away which he didn't seem to get, he just argued with us. Worst of all, no apology.They don't seem to value their customers. If he had been more apologetic and sincere it would have made all the difference. We won't be back."
Breakroom: How do I love thee?  Let me count the ways. 1. Tempura Fish Taco: So good.  Battered fish, yummy pickled onions, and a slide of avocado.   2. Breakroom nachos: LOVE these.  Ground beef and all sorts of toppings.  Breakroom is also REALLY good about substituting out the things you don't like, and the extras don't cost a whole lot.   3. Breakroom burger: Pretty sure even eating just one of these causes your arteries to turn on you.  Pork belly, egg, burger, onion ring - it's actually hard to get everything in one bite because it's so gigantic.  One of my favorite guilty pleasures.  4. Ribeye cheesesteak sandwich: Not my favorite Breakroom item but good nonetheless.   5. Breakroom fries: Every time. Normally food this indulgent doesn't turn me into Shakespeare, but Breakroom has me quoting Romeo & Juliet.  Caloric & certainly not health food, but can't be missed for a once-in-a-while meal.
My wife and I loved everything about Glasserie, the food, the ambiance, the setting, the building... The menu is unlike anything you've seen with many things to discover.
Nice restaurant but horrible customer service. Came here with my wife on our two year anniversary for a drink. We wanted to sit outside in their nice backyard. They refused because there was rain in the forecast, despite the fact that several parties were already seated outside. We said it would be fine and we could carry our drinks back to the bar if it started raining and they still refused (the place was pretty empty it was a Tuesday night). We went to the bar down the street and got seated outside :)
The food isn't inedible but considering that Go! Go! Curry only serve curry, the curry should be a lot better than it is. Curry-Ya only Serbs curry and it is stellar. Udon West serves a variety of Japanese dishes and has a good curry too. I'll let you know about the other curry places as I eat in them. We'll explore New York's Japanese curries together. I'll be piloting this ship and you'll be in the sidecar.  I ordered the chicken katsu with curry, the standard curry thing to eat. The chicken is all crispy and fine. The rice is fine. The curry is odd and not as good as other Japanese curries I've had. It's darker and less flavorful. The oddest thing is that it's served with a large side of shredded lettuce. Typically katsu curry dishes will have a small side of ginger. I don't think I've ever had Japanese food that incorporated lettuce and this was a lot of it. The place seats about 16 people and turnover is fast so getting a place to sit isn't too hard. Also there is no bathroom for customers. It's dingy inside but that's fine. The logo is a giant gorilla but there is no gorilla curry katsu on the menu and I found that to be confusing and false advertising.  The prices are low but good curry isn't expensive. I admire the spirit of this restaurant but will probably eat at other curry places.
"heard about this place for awhile, decided to go for a first date with this guy. It was very uncomfortable and just depressing all around. We decided to have a brunch date on the earlier side. They dont take reservations, and once I got there I understood why, its a bottom floor apartment they made into a restaurant, Its not cute, its not spacious, its small and tight and busy because its LIC, so there isn't much around in the his area. We decided to meet at 11am on Sunday, he got there before me. The whole vibe of the place is stresses and tired, even at 11am. The host was not happy at all, we were sat pretty quickly thankfully at close to the bar, near the entrance of the restaurant. because of the space its where everyone must pass you, everyone in the restaurant passes you, we were by the service bar. My date and I didnt even get to sit down for more than 10 seconds before this blonde russian waitress came over and asked us in a rush if we needed anything. no joke, Didnt even get to take a breathe. its 11am, whats the drama about? The only reason I will give this place any credit is the food is cheap and great for the price. That is it. We ordered coffee and drinks, she returned with them but without my wine, she ran off so I had to yell at her to ask her if the wine was coming, she cocked a attitude with me about asking, saying ""Its coming"" I yelled back to her across tables in a very angry voice ""Thank you"" because she was a pill. Our presence aggravated her.  I wanted to leave as soon as possible, its was just horrible. Not fun, not hospitable, you rushed and taking anytime to enjoy yourself isn't welcome. Its a joke. I tipped 18% because I felt bad for the place, but honestly I would have left 2 dollars because of the experience. I couldn't enjoy my date which I think set us not to see each other again because it just wasn't fun. I think the restaurant played a huge part in our experience in connection."
"Getting into the dim sum game, especially in NYC Chinatown, is no easy feat. I definitely give these guys props for their ambition. With that said, they have a lot of potential ahead of them. The interior is pretty bland (white walls), but they do have wall sockets (with USB capability) at most tables. Their menu is a little limited, and their portion sizes are pretty small, given that their prices are around $4-$5 a plate. The taste for the spareribs and chicken feet is competitive, but again small portions. Their ""soup"" dumplings are simply a shrimp dumpling (ha gow) in a small container with soup and a spoon. That's new. Overall it was an ok meal. I would try this place again, maybe in a few months once they had some time to mature."
The fries wings and oysters are good. The calamari is corny don't get it, no flavor whatsoever
it feels like i'm here every other week but technically, about once a month.  man friend is absolutely in love with this place and without fail thus far, only orders the hainanese chicken dish - half bird, full bird, all bird bird bird and a side of chicken broth rice. i'll be honest, that shit is pretty damn good but i can't eat that much chicken! so i usually get noodle soups (good, not great) or like during our most recent visit, the sauteed shrimp and okra w/shrimp paste dish - delish! their roti (pancake) dish with curry dipping sauce is mouth watering. portions are abnormally big for the price point but i'm not complaining. there is usually a wait but never too long, 10 to 20 minutes tops, sometimes even less. btw, it is cash only.
Let me preface this by saying that I was a supporter of Barboncino from the start. I've been in the neighborhood a few years before they opened and was psyched to find out, from what I've heard, it was owned an operated by a chef who worked at Paulie Gee's which is my favorite neapolitan pizzeria in NYC. It was never quite on the level of Paulie Gee's but it was still damn good and consistent. I haven't been here in a few months and after today I don't know if I'll be back.  I ordered the Sopressata Picante pie and a cup of coffee after realizing they took their brunch pizzas off the menu. The coffee came to me almost 10 minutes after ordering it. I figured it was a fresh pot but the coffee was room temp. Then the pizza came, which compared to when I've had it in the past, was pretty flavorless. The sauce was watery and clear. Once I cut the slice into a smaller slice the cheese came off in one clump. My girl ordered the Speck with the same issues. The prosciutto was damn good though as was the sopressata on my pie. It seems that the ingredients can't seem to connect together as a whole. Is it new management? Maybe it was a new chef. Maybe it was the Sunday afternoon B Team. If there were B Team menu prices then I'd be less annoyed.  The service was lacking as well. I understand its a Sunday and maybe Saturday Night is still effecting some of the staff, but if the restaurant is less then 40% at capacity, there's 2 servers and a busser, can you stop by and ask how everything is? Do I have to flag you down for more water? Do I have to ask you twice for the check? I'm not for a formal dining experience. I don't expect white glove treatment but can we get the basics down of very casual service? Are servers being trained at all?  I'm annoyed that I'm inspired to even write this and sound like every Yelper that's induced an eye roll. As far as neapolitan pizzerias go: Paulie Gee's, Roberta's, Emily's, Motorino are all light years beyond where Barboncino currently is.
The staff were friendly, but disorganized.  The eating is messy, but that is as I expected. What I did not expect was that the shrimp (which were, by the way gigantic) would be over-cooked and soft or that the Cajun sauce would be dull, oily and without heat (as in spicy).  The place feels and looks dirty.  Red sauce on the walls. Just because the eating is messy does not mean that the restaurant can't be clean.  All-in-all a disappointment after many good reviews.
It was a weekend when we went here and there was a snow storm that time. We arrived a little bit earlier and they opened their doors by 5pm. We met up a friend who is also the godfather of my daughter. It's been awhile since the last time we hang out with him.  We ordered 3 dishes and I can tell that it was prepared as an asian fusion (Filipino, thai, etc) rather than as authentic dish which for me is good.  I would go back again here in the near future so I could try the other dishes which I expect will be as good as the ones we had.
Wanted to love this place so much! I've been walking by and meant to come in over and over. I ate alone at the bar for breakfast on a weekday, well today actually. I was completely ignored. Someone took my order but that's where the service ended. My breakfast sandwich was ok. Just tasted like avocado toast with an egg. Chorizo was overly chewy (casing) and hard to eat, egg was under cooked. I love a good runny yolk but the white needs to be set. No one ever came back. 20 min of staring at a dirty plate. I pulled out cash, put it on the bar and left. Seriously couldn't even flag someone down. Left very disappointed and out $20 for a below average breakfast.
i think they actually do the best xiaolongbao in manhattan (which isn't saying much). usually my go-to wonton soup spot, and great hot pot rice as well. the black egg/ cilantro dumplings are really good too. generally pretty busy.
Had a pretty positive experience over all  Hosts were really friendly and sat me earlier than the quoted time.  My server was great but I wish she spent a little more time explaining the menu to me since it was a little extensive. I ordered only one main and the rest appetizers so I could experiment on more dishes and I must say the crab fried rice really surprised me. Though it might look a little on the plain side, the flavors were all there ! There was this duck salad that was insanely spicy so I barely picked at it and after my server had noticed, she had taken it of my bill.  Was very appreciative of that!  Most of the other appetizers were soso, but I'm usually just a very picky eater and didn't do any research prior to my dinner visit. (My fault)  No need to mention the main thing , ambience was incredible and my favorite part about my dinner experience at Thai Villa.  Will be back!
Unfortunately I didn't have the pleasure of eating here. My friend and I left after asking for menus after watching a table that walked in after us recieve menus. When we asked for menus we received an attitude from the waiter. To keep from popping off I just left. I'm sure the food may be delicious, but that waiter definitely left a bad impression.
One of the best things about this place was the soup dumplings. They were AMAZING! I don't understand why they were taken off the menu. Without them, they are just another Chinese/Szechuan restaurant with mediocre service. I won't go back until they put the soup dumplings back on their menu.
A lovely dinner, a very gracious and patient wait staff, a really delightful evening.
Food too expensive w/ minute portions. We all ordered the $30 set menu. Even All the girls were hungry afterwards Not only that, the 3 slices of bread was charged $5 each! If portions were that small, at least have decency of providing complimentary bread
This place, on 14th Street & 6th Ave, was among the many gems around the area, which we gladly observed while we got out of the subway. Felt like a pre-meal window shopping walk. What greeted us after we opened the door and entered the space, was an open kitchen. I mean, the most open I have seen, almost like a table at the farmer's market. The meat, the stove, the squash -- everything. On the contrary of being greasy and foggy, it was so delightful as if everything was soaked in sunshine, in a picnic. The waiters led us through the open kitchen and seated us at a two-person table, parallel to tables next to us. Looking around I could see many guests in suits. Their lunch break, I guess. Three tiny pink Carnation lit up our table. Harmony and I took a close up at the flowers, trying to figure out if they were real flowers that could wither. Yes. Soon, just like how every other Italian restaurant will do, we received a basket of -- free -- bread!! We were served two kinds of bread in the basket, a grey one with raisin cut in small pieces and some sour dough. We asked for more raisin bread. Harmony ordered the uni pasta, and I, although also an uni lover, decided to go with something else -- the Risotto with Shrimp & Three Mushrooms. The pasta was cooked relatively al dante (which I like). The risotto was so satisfying with the flavor from the mushrooms.  Compared to those rice soaked in creamy pasta sauces that I used to have, this was, never enough. My remember my first attempt at uni pasta, which was about two years ago at a Japanese restaurant in San Diego; and when I saw the same dish at Basta Pasta, I was excited to see Italians embrace uni too. I thought...maybe it wasn't Japanese who came up with the idea of having uni in pastas then. Until I learned later, that Basta Pasta, is an Italian restaurant, owned by Japanese. THANK YOU.
"Service: YAAAAAS  Food: YAAAAAS Space: YAAAAAS Value: YAAAAAS Sooooooooo goood.  Ordered: #48 - #1 House Special Noodle Soup - The broth is similar to Pho and dare I say even deeper and better tasting??!! Although it comes close to Pho in terms of broth, the noodles blow everything else away. So chewy and fresh, you can hear the ""slapping"" of the noodles from the kitchen which certainly adds to the flair and reputation of this place as one of the BEST noodles in NYC. I will definitely make it back here!!"
I was looking forward to it for months after discovering it on Yelp, so maybe my expectations were ridiculously high, but I was so disappointed when I finally had it last week. The Jerk Chicken was all hot and no sizzle, the rice and peas were nothing special, and the mac and cheese was bland with no taste. If you like spicey Jerk with a kick then this place is for you but aside from the caliente factor I would not bother with it.  Very nice staff though and good portions for the price. Get there early or they will run out of stuff like sweet plantains and Stew Chicken because they are massively popular. Also, cash only.
"Good bar in midtown west.  Stopped in a for a pre-dinner drink.   Lots of cocktails (in the $10 - $15 range) and a good beer selection.  I tried the ""Pinchy Paul,"" which was a little too sour for me, but still tasty.  My wife had the ""Sing Sing,"" which was their version of a Moscow Mule, and it was delicious. The everything pretzel was fantastic without being too pungent and the eggplant chips were as good as advertised.  After awhile, the honey was too much on the chips, so I would recommend sharing with 2-3 people."
The food is awesome and for NY the prices are reasonable. Although they are packed we were seated fairly quickly. I had the clams & linguine which was full of flavor and fresh. I dont know if it was the manager or one of the owners but there is a hilarious older gentleman thats full of personality and makes it an even more amazing experience.
I went there cuz all the hype on social media. Bad experiences about food and services. The lady who leads the table has really bad attitudes, cold and unfriendly. The food is okay like normal Italian restaurant. Overall the restaurant is so overrated. Will not come back again.
I don't often write reviews so I will keep this short and sweet.we had a stellar anniversary lunch here.the staff was great,we were waited in by Jason who deserves much praise.ordered 4 first course selections which were fantastic and well paced.on top of the complimentary dessert and beverage we received...they also went above and beyond to give us a sample of the lamb tartare we were asking about.being HUGE tartare fans we ordered the beef but inquired about the ingredients about the lamb and *boom* a sample was there for us.thank you for a memorable day.we will be back again
So first thing is first, my boyfriend was running late, as usual, and they graciously held our table for about 30 minutes past our reservation time, which is really not a thing many restaurants would do. I am a vegetarian, which we made known when we made the reservation and they were very accommodating. Beware, the vegetable tasting menu is NOT vegetarian, which is strange because what nonvegetarian would willingly order only vegetables?  To me the dishes really were not memorable, and honestly I don't even remember what I had. Backtracking onto service: It took probably 5 minutes to get menus, and if you're paying up for a meal, I would expect to get the menus sooner than that. The service was a little spotty all together, and at some points it was hard to even find our waiter, who I will add was friendly. At one point, when one of the people was bringing food to our table he even forgot what it was and had to go to the kitchen and ask. Again, this is not the type of service I expect when you're paying for a high-end meal but I wouldn't care if it were some casual place. I always see people complaining about wine pairings so I was wondering when people will realize it's a total rip off?! It's much better to just get a bottle. My boyfriend and I wanted to get a bottle and we asked the waiter, and usually at this point they would send the sommelier over, but that never happened. Maybe they don't have one? Seems a little odd. We ended up going with the Wind Gap Syrah, which was not fantastic but way better than the Pinot Noir on their BTG list.  I really wasn't a fan of the dessert because I found it all to be too sweet, but we ordered a cheese plate and it was deeeelicious! I'd actually say it was the best part of the meal, and they didn't even make the cheese!  All in all it's not a super romantic restaurant based on the sheer size. I would probably return one day to try it out again, but it's definitely not on the top of my list.
We were the first customer on a Sat morning. The receptionist kindly seated us 5 min earlier than their open. Definitely gave the Vanilla Bean French Toast for a 5 star! Salmon & Avocado Tartare worth a try.
They could use a hostess or something. Waited for 5 minutes with zero attention to incoming customers. Ended up stuck with a gruff bus boy who kept trying to give me the worst tables in the house and refused to give me a different small table for no good reason. Peace!
Lunch at Gramercy Tavern - Amazing!!! What a special place! Tripoline pasta with spinach  Chicken with roasted mushrooms and white truffles  Lamb shoulder braised with white bean purée. I would highly recommend this as a special romantic amazing restaurant!!!
Food 3 stars, service 0 stars. People need to realize how overpriced and over-hyped this place is. Not only is the brisket inconsistent - there isn't one side that is worth having. I have lived in BBQ capitals and not only are these prices ridiculous they don't portion it correctly. I know what half a pound looks like and what they are serving is not close. The mayo based coleslaw is all liquid and the vinegar based coleslaw will burn your lips it's so sour. The broccoli slaw has zero flavor, the fries are overcooked, and the Mac and cheese has the consistency of a thick cake. I've been here multiple times hoping the food would be decent and every single time is disappointing. The brisket I got today was 3/4 fat. The service brings it down even lower. The girls behind the counter have insane attitudes, roll their eyes, and argue with customers down the line. The service has gotten worse every time I've been. I can't believe the manager allows their staff to talk to customers the way they do. Not only do I receive constant rude behavior, I watched another couple simply walk out today because of the service. The employees are killing your business and the inconsistent quality and over priced food does not help. Myself and my friends, who live in the neighborhood, will not be back.
This place has changed since I was here many years ago.  It only had two restaurants and a lot of grocery items.  It now has food and groceries everywhere. The Resturant's  are in the price range of places on the area.  I am coming back later to eat here.
"Torn about not throwing in that 4th star. For what it's worth all of my friends have given it 5.  - High end noodles and cheese all around.  Everything cooked al dente but I assume you can request otherwise - The cheese wheel pasta is awesome and I appreciate the fun presentation of them scraping it out right at your table.  Due note it's rather un-filling compared to other dishes we had.  You will probably want extra bread or an app if you go cheese wheel.  - Had 2 dishes with various seafoods that we're all good but dominated by the sauce. With the exception of the crab meet I felt like any protein in the noodles could have been replaced by anything of similar texture.  When I have a mulit-meated dish I want each to create a more distinct experience. - Place runs like a well oiled machine.  I appreciate efficiency, but it felt to me like they're riding on their already established reputation and not worrying much about customer service.  There was no warm welcome by the server. d They seemed quite burdened to be asked questions about the dishes and inquiries we're handled with a bland ""yes or No"".   It also seemed a bit stingy to have to ask for olive oil (twice) at such a fancy place."
I have been going to Barrio Chino for many years. I highly recommend it for the younger crowd. It's very hop. The food is good. It's a bit over rated. Try Casa Mezcal if you want more authentic food and better Mezcal cocktails.  I only hesitate and give it a low rating because the quality has dropped off, lines are long, and it is possibly a victim of its own success now.
I usually never dine in Little Italy because most of the places are tourist traps. But when I saw Benito One had such great Yelp reviews, I decided to give it a shot. It turns out, I should have stuck to my initial instincts. 1. The sangria was overly sweet. It didn't taste like there was any wine in there. It was just loaded up with sugar. 2. The penne vodka wasn't horrible but the pasta was a bit overcooked. I like my pasta to have a bite to it but this didn't. Someone definitely left it in boiling water longer than he/she should have! 3. The fresh mozzarella, tomato, and roasted peppers appetizer was just not good. The 'fresh mozzarella' tasted like mozzarella you can buy at Costco, or maybe even Polly-o. The roasted peppers were from a jar so they were covered in slimy preservatives. The tomatoes were probably the highlight. 4. The insalata tricolore (arugula, endive & radicchio, with oil and vinegar) was the best thing I ate that night. It was also a really generous portion. If your best dish is a salad, that isn't really saying much.
L'Artusi is a PASS next time you're looking for good food in the West Village. The food was lazy and uninspired. All the pasta and protein was overly spicy to mask clear flavor insecurity. This plus Inattentive service and a characterless atmosphere made the trip my last.
"Absolutely disgusting customer service. Came here on a Wednesday night around 10 and the Yankee game was on, so it was packed. The hostess sat us at the only table they had available - which was in a corner with zero lighting, I couldn't even see the menu. She apologized and said that's the only table they had, and I think that part of the restaurant is being renovated. Fine, no biggie, I've been here a ton of times and the beer and food is good - so sitting at a crappy table wasn't that much of a problem. So then the waiter comes over. Early 20's wearing a baseball cap. I ask him what's on draft. He tells me the draft beers are on a tv screen on the other side of the room. I asked him if he had the paper menu for the draft beers. He says ""nope!"" (Lying azz. I just had the paper menu last week cuz the tv wasn't hooked up). I said ""so you expect me to walk all the way across the room and read that menu off the wall?"" ""Yup"". Then he laughs like it's cute. I told him ""it's bad enough this table sucks but this is your idea of customer service? I'm not paying for this treatment."" He laughs and says ""ok fine"". I wonder if his boss thinks it's fine that this idiot just let at least $80 walk out the door?  I should have asked to speak to a manager right then and there but I was so ticked off that it wouldn't have been a very coherent conversation. I literally just got done with a 12 hour work day and I'm gonna patronize your business and give you my money while being treated like crap? No thanks! Most of their staff is a unprofessional, but their intentions are good. But that waiter should have never been hired in the first place. Disgusting attitude. Zero customer service. I'll take my business elsewhere."
Best wings I've had in NYC - big, dry rubbed, crispy, plump, and juicy. The mezcal drink here, PARADISE FOUND, made with Vida Mezcal, Passionfruit, Pineapple, Agave, & Lime, is one of the best my wife has had and she is quite the Mezcal connoisseur! The bartender was very knowledgeable and attentive which always makes sitting at the bar a positive and memorable experience!
Great selection of wine flights for $12 (during happy hour) where you can either choose from a pre-selected flight put together by the staff, or you can pick and choose among the options. It is a very bustling place and a reservation is highly recommended during the happy hour. I wish they had better deals for small bites during happy hour, but the wine flight made up for that. Decent crostinis.
Awful service. It literally took them an hour to bring out our food. The waitress didn't keep our table supplied with water. She couldn't give us a time estimate for when our food would come out, and the food itself wasn't even that good. The brisket was dry, and the appetizers were doughy and boring. To add insult to injury they tacked on a 20% gratuity (really?!). I definitely can't recommend this place.
Well... tried it again just for old-time sake and to see if there is any difference. Well... yeah... it was different but not for the better. Server was nice, attentive, and full of smiles. Good to go on that. I ordered the steak with Yuka fries. Omg. Steak tasted a bit sour and the Yuka fries were burnt to a crisp and felt like I was snacking on fried chalk. No good. I can now honestly with good concious say I will never ever ever ever dine here again. 2 stars for service.
Great family style italian restaurant.  Came in a few days ago with bunch of coworkers and pigged out on their apps and entrees.  The restaurant is big (two floors) and can easily accommodate big groups.   We had bunch of apps-- the fried calamari, meatballs and stuffed mushrooms.  For entree, we ordered the black linguini and chicken parm.  And these dishes were enough to feed party of five.  My favorite of the five dishes were the meatballs.  They were amazingly delicious!  The other dishes were alright, nothing to write home about.  The black linguini dish was supposed to have an array of seafood (fish, mussels, fish), but there was an overload of calamari in the dish.  Since we already order the fried calamari as appetizer, it was just too much calamari for one night.  The chicken parm was pretty good.  I have to say their red sauce is pretty amazing-- tangy and light.  They also used different red sauces in their meatball, linguini and chicken parm dishes, which was quite nice and distinguished the dishes from one another. Service was good-- we were seated downstairs which was quieter and less crowded.  Nonetheless, we weren't forgotten and our server stopped by our table frequently to fill our water glasses and to inquire if we needed anything. I like the food at Trattoria Tricolore slightly better, but service here was better.
Great Restoran's with great atmosphere, love the fish. Bass is my favorite. Will recommend
I attended Saturday brunch for a big group celebration.  I had high hopes for this place, as it was really busy, so I figured it must be really good.  Even though the interior reminded me of a large, chain family type restaurant, it still had a slight hipness about it.  Or maybe it's just what I wanted it to have since it really did remind me of a big and loud cafeteria type restaurant.  Either way, it wasn't exactly inviting. My husband and I sat down and ordered drinks about 25 minutes after the rest of the group had already gotten there with drinks and appetizers on the table.  The waiter came back less than 5 minutes after we sat down asking for our food order, and we asked him if he could please start on the other side of the table since we had just gotten there and needed a few minutes to look over the menu.  Well, he decided to stand over us and wait for us to order our food.  All of this time, I am wondering why he couldn't just go and get the drinks we had ordered. 15 minutes later, we receive our drinks and my white wine comes out in a small glass with no stem.  What restaurant manager would allow a stemless glass of WHITE wine served?  The stem is there so that the hands won't warm the wine while in the glass.  But, that's the wine specialist in me, so I will move on. I receive my Maine Lobster Salad that I ordered and it was tasteless.  There was no good flavor to the salad, even though the concept was amazing.  Perhaps a little salt in the dressing could have made this salad really flavorful, but perhaps the Chef forgot to add seasoning. I had a bite of the Grilled Chicken Sandwich and the bread was so hard that as I bit into it, all of the chicken came flopping out of the sandwich.  The French Fries were ok, not great. The Mac and Cheese was the best thing I enjoyed out of all of the food.   The problem that I have with my experience here is that the waiter decided to bring out one bill for the entire table to split.  We got to the brunch late and the waiter knew people were already at least one drink ahead of us and appetizers had already been ordered and eaten.  We had to split the bill and ended up paying $60 more than what we should have had to pay all because the waiter decided to bring one bill out and not give us the opportunity to have our own check.  I don't go out to eat to pay for other people's drinks and food unless that's what I'm planning to do.  Had I known we were only going to get one bill, I would have ordered a steak and multiple drinks as some of the people at the table did.   2 stars for food, 0 stars for service!
Coming off a recent trip to Thailand I was in search for great Thai food in the city. I tried several spots before stumbling across Up Thai. This place was great. The food was incredible, the service was great, and the price was perfect. As I ate the food I felt like I was transported to a restaurant in Bangkok. The Papaya salad, chicken pad thai, pineapple fried rice, and red curry chicken were all incredible. If you are looking for great Thai food look no further.
Im full Chinese and I honestly don't think this place is good at all. I love dim sum and can tell whether it's freshly made or not. The texture of the food was a bit hard. It was definitely disappointing. There are way better traditional dim sum place you can find in Chinatown. Definitely won't recommend this place as it's more toward the tourist people when they visit Chinatown
Came earlier on a not too busy Saturday night. Music was too loud to chat over dinner, soda was flat. Liked the art work on the wall. Our order was delivered to another table by a runner who was having problems which table was which, so it took a much longer time to get ours. Flavor was better than most attempts at southern cooking until I bit into my second rather bloody chicken leg. If you like craft beer and loud music that early in the night, it's pretty good, but I doubt I will come back again..
Stopped by this restaurant last Friday because we wanted to grab some dinner before heading to Grand Banks. Ambience inside was really cute and pretty packed for dinner.  The service however was well below subpar. We walked in and requested a table for three. The hostess made us wait even though there were empty tables. My friends inquired about a couple of the ones next to the bar and she told us they were booked full, and then proceeded to seat us at one of the tables after a 30 min wait. Seriously?  Our also had a terrible attitude, didn't smile, was very curt and even forgot to tell us the dinner specials. We overheard her informing the table next to us later on. She made us feel like we were in her way when she was clearing the table, and even interrupted our conversation to remove the plates. The bus boy did a better job of making us feel welcome lol. I think our waitress realized halfway through the meal that she was doing a terrible job and the manager stopped by our table. She had the courtesy to apologize for her employees behavior which was much appreciated.  Locanda Verde's pasta dishes range from $25- $30, which is standard for nicer restaurants. Their meat dishes are $30-$40. We tried the grandmas ravioli, malfatti, broccoli rabe and grilled shrimp. They were all pretty good but not worth the price, especially in NYC where there are so many choices for Italian.  Obviously my review is biased towards my personal experience with one server so I don't think it represents the restaurant as a whole. I do think they need to re-train their staff because most of the people we encountered were unprofessional. I most likely won't be dining here again.
"Sometimes, I go to places and I just don't understand how it's so highly rated.  Perhaps its just a one-off bad experience or my palette just isn't the same as everyone's.  However, I went as a group of 4 and we all left very unsatisfied and unhappy.  I just went through some of the reviews for this place and hellooooo sketchy!!!!  So many reviews from folks who have basically 1 review each and how does this place constantly get reviewed every day? Reading the ""reviews not recommended"" section was a hoot, too. First off, apparently this place is only hot because of their margaritas.  The waitress wasted no time going on and on about their many flavors of margaritas.  I don't drink, so no thank you from me! We ordered guac to start with.  Their guac was something like $11 or $12 and was this tiny bowl of guacamole that was starting to oxidize and turn dark.  It looked like it had been made at least an hour ago and was just sitting around or something.  It was too mushy and did not taste fresh at all.... and too much onion or something.  Not worth it. They also messed up our friends orders and gave her 3 enchiladas instead of two.  When she pointed it out, they took it to the back and I guess removed an enchilada?  Wouldn't most people just say oh well, keep the extra? All of us got similar dishes and got the enchiladas.  These are literally the worst enchiladas I have ever had.  One was filled with chili (yes, I chose chili, but where have you seen chili-filled enchiladas?).  The other was filled with shredded beef that basically tasted like the chili.  Rice was meh and so was the refried beans.  They also charge an extra $5 or something like that grilled steak if you want it.  What really grossed us all out was when the manager or owner came out carrying our plates of food and he had THE LONGEST FINGERNAILS.  They were literally longer than mine. I can't imagine it's hygienic to be carrying peoples plates of food when your fingernails are longer than mine have ever been and probably have tons of bacteria hiding underneath them.  Sorry, but this made us all lose our appetite. They gave us a free tres leches cake for dessert, but at that point we were just ready to get out of there. Overpriced, unauthentic Mexican food with meh service.... and maybe some sanitary issues.  Edible food, but unsatisfying and way, way too expensive."
The food is very good but they get 2 stars off.  Demerit #1 = even if you have a reservation, for some reason they don't seat you immediately.  Every time I go (3x in the past 12 years) they make you wait 20-30 mins past your reservation time. This weekend we had a 9 PM rez, had to approach the desk at 9:20 to see whats going on. Got seated at 9:28. Demerit #2 = prices.  My guess is they take advantage of their reputation and charge as much as possible.  $30 for a Caesar Salad? Yeah I know its served on a platter but come on now.  It's romaine, dressing, croutons and cheese!! Do yourself a favor if you want family style Italian... skip Carmine's and try Tony's di Napoli on 43rd on the other side of Broadway! Great food, usually no wait & you'll save a few bucks!
These guys called my cell phone at 11 am the day of my reservation, asking that I confirm my reservation by 3pm or I would lose my reservation.  I work - like a normal Joe - and didn't know that they called until 5 pm that evening.  At that point, they had already just cancelled my reservation.   If you're going to have such a policy, at least have the decency to call a day in advance and state the policy like list decent restaurants.   This should be a 1 star review, but the food is ok.   Will NOT RETURN.
Came here around 10:45pm on a Thursday night and only had to wait 10 minutes for a party of 2. There's also a bar area so you can snag some drinks while you wait!  We ordered -- Edamame ($6) Akamaru modern ramen ($15) + Nitamago (+$2) Hirata buns - pork ($9) The ramen was solid, the broth was flavorful and all ingredients were quality. Highly recommend adding the nitamago (soft boiled egg), it complemented the bowl of noodles perfectly. The pork buns were actually a bit disappointing - too saucey and the quality was just average. Would not order this app again! The staff were all attentive and polite. Great ramen spot if you're in the area but not worth a 30+ minute wait IMO.
Dine here if: -You like to apologize to your friends or date for picking this place. -You and your dining partner/s find pleasure in keeping the smell of smoke and everything you eat impregnated on your clothing and hair for the rest of the evening or for as long as you don't wash them.  -You love to feel like a chef. Being so close to where your food's being sautéed that you can get a good, sexy sweat going during your meal. -You like a rude, rough, forgetful server who could give a shit about hospitality and clearly ended up in the wrong line of work. You enjoy having to keep reminding him of your orders after waiting on them for impossibly long periods.  Our table of 8 kept piling up with finished dishes and drinks but he didn't seem to mind the clutter and thought maybe we enjoy making towers out of plates. After finishing dinner (as quickly as possible given the smokey-fish-sauna atmosphere we were entrenched in) we couldn't find him for over 10 minutes. When we ask the other staff if he had gone on strike, they go up to a table and tap his shoulder. He was having some grub with his buddies in the table booth behind us! He gets up gives us our check, no apologies. Like a true alpha male. Sits BACK down to eat. Someone in our group has to go back to him asking to charge our cards.  Aww, maybe he was really hungry? Well, clearly the management of this place is NOT hungry for repeat customers. Or any customers. The place was almost empty on a Friday night and it's clear why.  Though the prices are on the more ambitious side of the spectrum even by NY standards, they still cut every corner a restaurant can cut: from disposable chopsticks instead of silverware to not bothering to have an air extractor on top of the kitchen to picking up this server from the parking lot of a WWE Smackdown. Don't waste a dime or your precious time here.
Love the dim lighting! Great wine and lasagna.  Lasagna was made with bolognese sauce!
Finally went to this place today after work, wanted to go for so long but the wait is usually 30-45mins. Pretty sure the line is more because of the small space than the food. Got seated after about 45 mins ( went to a bar cross the street at the mean time ). Ordered: Wings: very very good, crispy and firm Pork and crab meat noodle: kinda weird, no sauce on it?? Have to add sauce by myself, apparently it's the right way to do it, because of that the flavor is not quite mixed together Spicy seafood noodle soup: my friend ordered this and I took a sip, VERY spicy, I cannot handle it and I usually really enjoy spicy food. She did not finish because of that. Space is very small but kinda cozy, overall not bad for a bite but will probably have to try more things on the menu to decide the level.
"Grab all the people you care for and rush them over to Glasserie, it's an intimate experience you need to share with others. As you walk into Glasserie, you are immersed into a community of truly beautiful people, the bartender being the central hearth of the city. A hybrid light and airy Near East meets hardcore Brooklyn decor. You can hear the person you're sitting across from, but not be tucked away from the energy bursting around you. Grab a cocktail while you wait for your reservation (which you absolutely need on a weekend night). We opted out of the rabbit (which looked amazing). Instead, our table ordered a substantial array of dishes to get a true idea of the menu's intent. The ""small things"" were slightly better versions of dishes we've all had before at other restaurants (aside from the Grilled Radishes, which blew our minds). Little did we know these were teasers of what was to come. The elevated execution of the ""Dishes"" kept us wanting even more tastes of everything, all grabbing for the plates and wrestling over last morsels. The Crudo and the Steak come highly recommended. But whatever you order, do not leave this place with out dessert. The crescendo, Chestnut Cake (chestnut flour, pinenuts floating on a lake of pomegranate) and Chocolate Tart presented us with new flavor profiles that make the soul of your palette feel reborn. Thank you for reminding us how incredible food can be."
oh mu my expectations were so high for this place can't say I'm too impressed with this establishment, it's left me slightly dissapointed for many reasons. came here at 4:30 thinking there was going to be a massive line, but was politely told by the hostess that the line doesn't start forming untill a little before 5. Came back at around 4:55, was the first one online and immediately a small but ravenous queue formed up behind me. Came in and was seated almost immediately after they tried to plan out the seating arrangement, kudos to the host for the heads up on the line and speedy service to my table.  ordered the foie Gras stuffed fried chicken gyoza app? the signature mu ramen and the mu ichiban. the appetizer was incredibly bland for my taste, the foie Gras barely registered as I bit into the deep fried wings and the sauce was too sweet and light and didn't pack enough of a savory element to it. I nibbled and tried the mu ichiban and was impressed by the smokey rich mushroom taste of the broth and was absolutely blown away at how delicious, smokey and tender the pig jowl was for this dish. the dish i ordered was the signature mu ramen, I was left equally impressed and a little repulsed by this dish. the oxtail marrow broth was absolutely spectacular, it was so rich with umami flavors, it just enveloped my tongue and took me to a happy place while I was slurping the soup, but as for the actual dish , it left me perplexed and irratated. the corn beef was excellent, it was tender and flavorful, and if we just left it at that this place would have received close to top marks........i then to my horror bit into a sliced pickle and was instantly turned off to the dish. pickle juice does not go well with what is supposed to have been a deep rich savory broth, the kick of pungent vinagary fermented cucumbers left me in a sour place ( see what I did there ). I'm all for creativity and pushing things to the next level, but please don't mess around with a classic like ramen, if I were looking for fushion Jewish/japanese ramen id try to go out and find one (pretty sure they don't exist).  overall this place was interesting to say the least. the pretentious hipster atmosphere didn't win any points, and neither did the exorbitant prices for the food (18 dollars for 2 pieces of chicken? 20 dollars for a bowl of ramen?). The only thing that redeemed this place a smidgen is the absolutely heavenly broth and pig jowls they serve up here. Don't think I'd come back as the price is a little rediculous, the food was pretty bland and uninspiring and a pastrami sandwhich and pickle flavored bowl of ramen is something my palate will never get used to
Pros: * Amy Ruth is a must-try in Harlem and worth the wait!  * Amazingly delicious food! We had the fried chicken & waffles, mac & cheese, and mashed potatoes and everything was so so good. The waffles was the best I've had in a very long time. * Unassuming and chill atmosphere * Great service!   Cons: * The wait system is a little unorganized so make sure to put your name down with the hostess and hover around the door to make sure you don't miss your name being called out. We went on the Sunday morning 12:30PM and we waited about 30 min.  * Loved that you get cornbread as a free starter, but was disappointed as it was surprisingly dry :( The pictures looked so moist!
Midtown Location:  I do not know what the allure of this restaurant is.  Wait times easily exceed one hour, the food is average quality, and the place is very loud when they get busy (almost all the time).  The family style portions are obnoxiously large (and expensive)... but provides for some level of value for large groups looking to dine in NYC.   Uptown Location:  I experienced better service, food quality, ambiance, and more warmth in this location than the vast, open, cavernous midtown location (with little to no sound boundaries).  The uptown location experience was enough for me to change my 2 star review to 3.   There are better Italian restaurants in NYC (especially if you are willing to go the Little Italy section of NYC, but Carmine's was a good restaurant for the large group we had).  Family style restaurants can be difficult for those with dietary restrictions (vegan, gluten free, dairy free, etc.).  Carmines has a vegan and gluten free menu and are very accommodating, but family style.
"Yet another delicious spot for A+ fried chicken in the BK. Before I get into the food, do be warned that the HotHouse is small (but cozy), so the seating lines can get quite long. Budget at least 30 minutes. Now to the food and drink. Peaches has a nice selection of Southern-inspired cocktails, which go great with the chicken and biscuits. (I highly recommend the one with bourbon, sweet tea, and peach schnapps.) The bartender was also funny, courteous, and gave us great advice about what to order. That advice: to NOT get the ""extreme hot"" chicken unless you know you're ready. So...I took his word, and my friend and I ordered the hot chicken plate with mac and cheese on the side. It was the right choice - the chicken was spicy (and I like spicy food, for the record), but not overwhelming. The breading was flavorful and crispy, but did not dry out the foul beneath. And the biscuit and mac and cheese made for filling, comforting sides (if a tad bland). Needless to say my friend and I left Peaches very full. Expect to pay about $25 for food AND drink, so considering the quality, reasonable. I can't wait to go back to this place next time I'm in Bed-Stuy."
If you want Malaysian, this is definitely the spot. My ma and pa used to take me here when I was a yungin' and being the first Malaysian restaurant I've ever been to, they've set the bar really high for other places. This place is located on the border of Chinatown and Little Italy, and with so many other places to eat, Nyona can be pretty easy to miss. However if you stop by, you'll be glad you did. The place looks small from the outside, but when you walk in, you'll be surprised by how big it really is. The seats are pretty close together so it can feel crowded if they get busy. There's seating available for small and large group. When I went, we got a nice seat with a window view. You can come here for a casual meal, but this is one of those nicer restaurants. The lighting is dim, but the place looks clean as far as I can tell.  The food is amazing. The menu is huge and can be a little overwhelming if this is your first time and have never has Malaysian. However, I've had a lot of their items and can tell you you'll be safe with almost anything you pick. The ingredients are fresh has the perfect amount of seasoning. The owner of the place is actually Malaysian and I've heard that some of their ingredients are shipped from Malaysia (don't know if this is true but I believe it). Most items are $10+ so it's no cheap eat, but definitely very fair for the quality you are getting. The service was pretty average. Not bad, but nothing special to say about it. Conclusion: if you've never been here, you're missing out.
GET THE BURNT ENDS.  My boyfriend and I were in the area and decided to get some brunch. On a Sunday around 12:30, there was no wait! We were seated pretty much immediately outside (though they had a good amount of seats inside as well), and our server followed up right after with our waters. She was friendly and quick to get our food, orders in and the check.  We got the burnt ends (obviously) which came with a mimosa, salad, roasted potatoes, toast, and scrambled eggs. It was huge portion, and we still got the creamy mac and cheese and brisket hash. It was all very solid - the burnt ends were definitely my favorite part of the meal. It all came with sauces on the side (original and hot), which I appreciate. The salad was a bit overdressed for me and the mac and cheese was just alright for me but other than that I'd say it was a pretty good meal.
Doma opened towards the end of 2015, and at that time, I picked up a take-out menu to see what they offered. Well, in those three months or so, the menu has been condensed a bit, and prices of box meals have gone up about $3.00 on average.  Other prices have stayed the same.  Overall, prices are reasonable for quality and portion size.  They have good lunch specials during the week, as well.  Complementary tea.  Ambiance is nothing special, beer selection is outright terrible (they'd do better as a byob), but the service was friendly.  Strangely, I noticed that with our table and others, the food comes out as its ready.....meaning Men may be served before Women, and you might get your appetizer with your meal or even a few minutes after.  Didn't bother me, but it's worth noting. Food is solid.  We ordered two different ramen bowls and soy garlic wings. The wings were good, but fall way short of Amazin' and in Queens, I expect Amazin' from more than just the Mets! The ramen and dumplings, had three awesome dumplings that made it very hearty.  The cheese ramen was also quite hearty and traditional.  Right down to the two slices of Kraft American on top. Unfortunately, I have to disagree with other reviewers who say 'spicy means spicy' here.  I asked for my dish to be EXTRA spicy, and it was not.  Wasn't even close, but it still tasted great!   A good Korean option in Sunnyside, and as Arnold would say, I'll be back.
Great food and wine, great service. I moved to NYC from a little town in Texas so it took me a while to wrap my head around how there was a well-known restaurant inside a carpet and furniture store, of all places. But ABC Kitchen is so established for a reason. My friends and I tried several dishes for dinner -  Crab toast with lemon aioli: I would literally come back just to eat this toast. The crab is so fresh and tender, and worked so well with the toast and aioli that my heart did palpitations. I think everyone should try this at least once. Shaved raw fluke with horseradish, celery root, and lemon: Very refreshing in its lightness, but also very, very, horseradishy. I didn't get much of the other flavors as everything was drowned out by one note. Pasta with pork ragu and chile oil: I think this was taken off the menu so I can't find the exact name now, but in any case, it was delicious. Very interesting combination of traditional Italian fare with Chinese chile oil. I hope this comes back sometime! Fried organic chicken with collard greens and hot sauce butter: This'll make you regret every bad decision you've ever made regarding your waistline, but it's guilty pleasure food at its best so get it anyway. To be perfectly honest, I'm not sure how well a pool of spicy butter works with crispy fried chicken; some people will be like 'gross' and some will be like 'give it here right now' and for better or worse my gluttonous stomach falls into the latter camp. Crispy pork confit with braised turnips and smoked bacon marmalade: Literally fall off the bone good - easily a crowd favorite. Salted caramel ice cream: Terrific. We agreed that we should've gone with the sundae though - it sounds like a lot, but several scoops of just salted caramel ice cream by itself, no matter how good, gets a little monotonous pretty quickly. The main gripe I have with ABC is that somehow, it feels too impersonal. Food was wonderful and service professional, but something about the ambience had me feeling almost like I was part of a museum exhibit on dining.
Let's be real, $14+ for a sandwich in a basket is pushing it. We've got restaurant prices without the wait service or atmosphere. I paid $26 plus tip for an Italian square thing and a craft beer. You could easily walk over to Speedy Romeos in the afternoon and get better service and atmosphere. The environment at Mekelburgs feels like single man freelancer cafeteria. Food was average but will not be returning. edit:  I got some stuff from the super market part, it was expensive but it is 'cool' stuff not readily available anywhere else in the area. edit2: I just saw message from the owner, and i deleted it so not sure how to respond to him so i hope he reads this - 1  mr.mekelburg snarkily suggested he'd give me 'two plates' if I wanted something besides a basket, first of all dude, your presentation is whack, and plates at this point won't fix your frumpy sandwich dungeon. 2 mr.mekelburg snarkily made a comment about getting a 'coors and sandwich' around the corner if I was displeased with his pricing ... this sounds classist and you should heed to suggestions instead of responding with such tone-deafness  seriously, you're place is OK, Yelp sucks I know, but 5 stars doesn't exactly mean good business, i've lived in NYC my entire life and seen places come and go because they expect some higher paying crowd to settle with mediocrity.  like said in my initial review *which was 3 stars*, your atmosphere and service could use help. it's not personal, just take it into consideration without being so sensitive, no one wants to see small businesses fail.
It was a cool spot for lunch. Me & my good friend enjoyed the Connecticut Lobster Roll which was recommended by our waitress. The rolls were good. No complaints! More then enough lobster on there. The fries were delicious. Well seasoned. No salt needed.  For drinks we ordered the sea breeze margarita & drunken cherry lemonade which was good. Our bartender made sure we tasted our liquor for sure!  For dessert we ordered the funnel cake without the blueberry compote & vanilla ice cream on the side. It was quite oily & over cooked. Was not impressed with it what so ever. Definitely not worth it.  The staff was pleasant. Very well mannered & friendly. Shout out to their new waitress in training Emily who was just sweet & quite attentive
I ate 6 large slices. I'm 130 pounds. It's that good.  Ask for more mozzarella on the margherita to make it worth. I also tried the #4 with prosciutto, but I don't think the $10 increase in price is worth!  This is the greatest pizza in NYC.
This place is adorable. My friend suggested this spot and we arrived at a brightly colored house strung with light and other festive Cuban decorations. The food here is affordable and made to order.  I tried the fish taco, steak taco, guac, and plantains.  All were great though I highly recommend the steak taco above all. There is a lot of outdoor seating and a decent amount of indoor seating. Not sure how it will work during the colder months - but certainly a great place for the summer!
Excellent food.  Cool atmosphere.  Really nice, warm staff.  A hidden gem in Queens. Two standout dishes were the Platocones and the Shirt Steak on Skewers with Chimichurri sauce. We will be back. :)
The food is really good!! Love the pasta with squid. Will definitely come back again.
This is a great workers food stop. For the price, the flavors cant be beat and the portions are filling. I will be back to explore the menu.
Was here around 4:30, happy hour, almost no guest at all. The bartender was quite uninterested, ordered a Cosmo, have had better. The complementary snacks were quite ok, don't think I'll come back.
"Instead of regurgitating what literally thousands of other people said about this place, I'll just let you know of what I've experienced from coming here several times over the course of a few years.   It feels like the quality here is hit or miss at times.  Some days, the corn is great, and you think...""Wow this is awesome!"".  Then on another day you may think, ""Yo, they forgot how to make even corn"".  And on those days in which the corn may not be as good, their mains are fantastic.  And on the days the corn may be awesome, their mains are meh."
I came here on a Wednesday at 7 with no reservation for two, we were seated in 10 min. The hostess was friendly and the best part of the experience.  I ordered the Tres Hombres with pulled pork, two ribs and brisket sample for 16.95 (with two sides - max and cheese and fries). The food was underwhelming. Dry and abit cold.  Service was incredibly slow. Incredibly. Like ask your waiter for water when your food already came out slow. Getting the check took a good while. I don't think I'll be coming back.
Have a drink here but whatever you do, do not eat here.  The food is tasteless.  The service is slow.   I haven't have a meal this bad in a long time.  Plus it was expensive and you leave hungry.  But the atmosphere is nice for a drink before or after dinner.  And the garden is lovely.
First things first--this place has 4.5 stars across 1500 reviews. That's the best review I've ever seen--universally adored, and should be strong enough motivation to go. My girlfriend and I popped in for dinner. We came early enough to sit at the bar, but reservations here fill up way in advance. It is small plates and tapas, but everything we had was fantastic--tuna tartare, scallops, pepper shrimp, and many more. This is my favorite dinner in BK right now, and we will be back in a heartbeat.
I wasn't impressed. Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't bad, it just wasn't great! The service was decent. Food comes out quick. I had spaghetti with bolognese sauce and it was just spaghetti... not really worth having again and wouldn't recommend. My family had lasagna and vodka sauce pasta and both were good! Overall, nothing out of the ordinary here.
I rarely feel the need to visit a restaurant multiple times but this is an exception. The ramen was, dare I say, the best ramen I think I've ever had. I had the Tonkotsu with an egg. So much rich, complex flavor made the relatively small sized bowls seem much bigger than they were. And the ambiance was comfortable and hip. I want to try the limited edition ramen next! This place ranks at or above other top NYC ramen destinations.
Met here with a few co-workers for some awesome dining and drinks. One of the ladies had dined here before and was raving about it so I was looking forward to feelin the fuss, ya dig? Now, I'm a southern born and raised black woman with a granddaddy who smoked a pipe while makin shine in the garage. Ya heard? I grew up on soul food and, perhaps, therein lies the issue. I was expecting to be blown away and, unfortunately, this fell a bit flat.  With the greens and peas egg roll (DELICIOUS) leading the experience, I was convinced this was going to make me slap somebody's aunt sass but, alas, it was the stand out for the night. My smothered chicken was bland, rice & peas dry and the greens tasted canned. I did try another person's Mac-n-cheese and yams and while the yams were tastums the Mac-n-cheese didn't stand up to it. For those prices, I doubt I'd make a second trip but if I do, it will be for apps (more egg rolls please!) and drinks only. That Harlem Tea...I've had raunchy dreams about it. Shout out to the bartender (who was a gorgeous chic who happened to remind me of the guy who stars in Mr. Robot...only, obviously, a girl) on that one. That drink was everything. I'm going to write it a love letter right now.
"It's a bit difficult to type this review since my hands are covered in food (more on that later). I ordered to go food from pok pok on 9/23. I picked up the order and asked would it be ok to eat at the bar and have a few drinks.  Both the hostess and manager discouraged this noting that there was an 1.5 hour wait. I pointed out that the hostess sat the couple immediately before me after telling them "" there is a 1.5 hour wait for a table, but you can sit now at the bar."" They were seated at the bar which had 4 open seats.  The manager-robot replayed her pre-recorded ""there is a 1.5 hour wait"" track. As a business owner, I strive for honest customer service. My guess is that the to go order made a bar seating unfavorable. I'd rather be told this than lied to. Lack of honesty in a business makes me skeptical about how they might handle other issues. Also, to go orders should come with plastic utensils (standard in NYC)."
This place is so unprofessional the service sucks and when i went there i had to return my food twice because there was hair in my food the drinks are watered down DO NOT GO THERE I WARN U GUYS!!!!
I like the food, but not the service. I've been to the Delancey one twice. Their service is much much better. I went here yesterday with my family around 9. It was quiet, no line at all. While we were looking at the menu, they offered us cups of water. When I drank it, it smelled so bad. The cups smelled like fish! So I told a busboy about the smell and asked him to change it for us. He then frowned but still took away the cups. BUT THEN 10min later, HE BROUGHT BACK THE SAME CUPS. I knew because I could still smell that fishy smell!!! gross! I guessed he didn't pay attention to what I said and he just changed the water! So we asked another waiter for hot water instead. When we were almost done, the busboy just handed us the check, he didn't ask at all. He didn't even offer us the clear broth! Really poor service...we are disappointed
I am still sitting in this restaurant right now because no one is taking our check.  The cruise started boarding at 12, and started the trip at 12:30. We didn't get the menu and bread until at least half an hour later, even we were keep asking for them. It took another ONE HOUR to get our appetizer. And it was already 1:30, that the cruise had already finished the trip and already back to the ferry. We grabbed an waiter complaining about getting nothing even bread but it made no difference to the super slow speed. Yes we finished the dishes, not because they were tasty but we were starving.  I can't complain more about this meal. Me and my mom came visit from boston. It is the worst Mother's Day experience ever. If you cherish your time, cherish the ones you are about to have a meal with. My sincere advice is to take them to the other places.
Overall pretty great. The menu is small and manageable. The food is good and not overbearingly heavy. You know it's a good Italian place the minute the oil hits the table for the bread bowl and it has body and heft! Service was good. Food was good - but nothing spectacular. I'd probably come again if I were in the area but wouldn't go out of my way.
"I'm in town on business and googled restaurants near my hotel to have a nice dinner. On previous nights I had dinners with colleagues, but tonight I ventured out on my own. I found Lillie's Victorian on Yelp and not only did it sound nice, but the menu also really appealed to me. It was only a short walk, so I headed over, not thinking that I would an issue getting a table for one. It was a Saturday evening, so I was willing to wait if necessary. There were two young hostesses and when I inquired about a table, one of them said they had no tables because they had just seated the last one. That was it. No waitlist, suggestion that I wait, nothing. So I asked, and was told I could sit at the bar ""if I could find a seat."" Again, that was it. No customer service at all. And all this time the other young girl just stood there, staring at me.  I did take a look down the long length of the bar, but by this point I was totally turned off and this place lost its appeal for me. I'm not used to such poor service so I was very disappointed!! I left and found a much better place around the corner. I would NEVER try to patronize this place again!!"
We came in because my group has been here before and raved about the burritos. We came in as a group of three for lunch, and they refused to seat us since the booths for four tops were just seated and they only had two tops open. They said the manager (who wasn't in yet) didn't let them seat three tops, even after we offered to be a two top and a one top (aka split bills). Surely they wouldn't turn away a single person who came in from the cold and rain, right? Turns out they would. So we left.
"I used to eat here for brunch at least once a month, something has gone very down hill.  I always get the corn and jalapeño pancakes with pulled pork.  Today I just went and had pancakes that were as flat as tortillas and the tiniest helping of pork for the same price I used to pay for meal that actually filed me up.   I also had a pickle back, which was hardly deserving of the name.  There was about a 1/8th oz of pickle juice in a cup next to my full shot of whiskey...I thought the cup was empty until my friend pointed out ""no that's the back, I guess"" Ultimately, very sad experience.  I left hungry if you can believe it.  I will still go here for dinner, but I won't be returning for brunch. If they are going to serve brunch like that, they might as well not open until dinner."
Fun bar/restaurant close to the theatre district. Cocktails were very good, the food was good but not great.
Probably no doubt the worst Thai place I've ever been to or the worst restaurant in fidi. Ordered takeout and waited for ONE HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTES. Had to go back home first and later came back while going for grocery shopping. And they still weren't ready.  Ended up having some king Special of theirs, which tastes extremely bad. Chicken is half cooked and egg too salty.  Similar experiences happened to lota friends of mine.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
The food arrived 30 minutes late and cold. there grilled chicken had a rubbery texture and Tortillas were soggy and the veggies were mushy ,The best part of the meal was throwing the over packaged crap into the garbage.
This place is AWESOME!  The staff is lovely and very helpful. The pasta is 5 STAR!!! I tonight ordered from them for the second time. The first time I ordered The Pizzaioala and tonight I ordered The Bolognese ......and  I could not be happier. I am a big eater....and I sincerely think that the portions are more than adequate!  If I did not love the pasta so much....I could easily make it into TWO meals!  ( I am truly 100% perfect confused about the comments that say the portions are small ???)  I can't help but eat the whole serving!  It is impossible not to  finish.....sooooo delicious!   Welcome to the neighborhood Bigoi Venezia
"Joe Shanghais is a bit of a institute in China town. It does have a signature dish (which in fairness can be found in other locations) which is the soup dumplings.  The joy in these hot parcels of delight is not the flavor themselves but watching people try to navigate their way around them For the first time. The questions they ask themselves of ""do I eat it whole??""...""do I bite and try to drink the soup first??""...""do I have to use chopsticks??"". So many questions with no real answer. It's joyous on so many levels. The rest of the food is good. Noodles are fresh, lemon chicken isn't too rich and the sizzling beef really is sizzling. But also tender and well marinated to capture the spices that seep in deep into the meat to give it a fuller taste. We of course did the classic Chinese ordering technique of ordering too much. But with all this, and a beer, it came to $25 (inc tip) and we eat like kings (or queens). I'm still full and this was 2 days ago."
One of my favorite dish on the menu besides the Ramen is the U&I. It's a small rice bowl with spicy tuna, ikura, uni and a big ball of wasabi. All of the ingredients and flavors mixed so well together and made it a phenomenal dish. I also tried the 'Mu Ramen' which contains a oxtail and bone marrow based broth. The ramen noodles were thin and quite delicious and the broth its self was so flavorful and amazing.  The downside of this place is its lack of space. The restaurant is so tiny that on any given day you can expect to wait for a seat. I wouldn't recommend this place for a large group of friends, since their seating arrangement is literally one large shared table. The dishes are also quite expensive and is on par with the Ramen spots in the city, if not more. But overall I would definitely give this place a try.
It's hard to tell by the outside, as it's situated in such a touristy (and ultra convenient) location, but this is a really beautiful spot. Would be a great place to impress a date, or bring a group of friends out. Started out with some Soju, which I'm still not quite sure what it is, but was very enjoyable! I like to think of it as some cross between sake and vodka, but I may sound crazy. As appetizers, we ordered hot and spicy chicken wings which were perfectly seasoned and crunchy. We also had the fish steamed buns. The buns were delicious, and great fish to bun ratio! As my main, I ordered the Uni bibimbap which consisted of sea urchin, kimchi, crispy quinoa, salmon roe, capelin roe, micro greens, raw egg yolk, lettuce, and pickled cucum. It was a cold dish, and I'm glad the server gave me a heads up about that. It was really good, and I especially enjoyed the uni. However I think I may order something different next time. Personally, I find hot sauce adds so much flavor to a bibimbap. However I felt like hot sauce would interfere with the uni flavors as uni is so delicate, so I held back. I'd also like to mention the excellent service we received. Diz was our server and she was fantastic! Had great personality and I really appreciated her recommendations.
I have to admit, I was a little scared to go here. Previous reviews made it sound like the soup guy from Seinfeld. But the counter people are perfectly pleasant. They're business-like but they have to be. So the food: the lamb burger and spicy hand ripped lamb noodles were even more amazing than I'd expected. The mouth-feel of the noodles, the level of spicing, just amazing.  The vegetarian dumplings though, they were not good. Mealy filling inside a very nice dough. And the spicy cucumber salad was just fine. We will go back, and I'm guessing more noodle dishes will push it to 5 stars.
I got pad Thai and tom yum soup. I had better pad thais but this was not bad either.  It was my first experience of tom yum soup and I guess I liked it. The portion of the food for lunch menu was ideal. The pad Thai was with shrimps and the amount of the shrimps was fairly enough too; however, since I hate crispy-almost raw shrimps I couldn't eat them.  The staff was very nice and helpful.
Everything that had set this place apart from other Mexican restaurants is gone. The flan no longer is served with the ice cream which made it so unique. It is now a bland flan with lightly toasted almonds not worth the money. Might I add I sometimes came here after lunch just to eat the flan??? The burger no longer has the crispy fried cheese layer. There are no longer the delicious pickled onions on anything.  What is the point of coming here for boring overpriced food? I hope the owner will bring all the good things back just like how the corner deli branch brought back cochinita.
"I came here for brunch a while back with my wife and sister-in-law shortly after they opened. My experience was ""fine,"" but underwhelming, whereas their experience was essentially ""bad."" Either the food was cold, the item that we actually received didn't match what it said on the menu, or it just wasn't good. FOOD: so, I was in the mood for a more classic breakfast, and I decided to make my own from the top of the menu, ordering scrambled eggs, bacon, and toast. I don't remember what my sister-in-law ordered, but my wife ordered the chicken filet sandwich (she *loves* southern style chicken sandwiches) and fries. I remember my food was perfectly fine, except the toast was damn near rock solid. My wife's chicken sandwich was out and out cold when she got it, but the fries were good? She tried powering through it, asked them to warm it up some more, etc., but she couldn't get through it. DRINKS: I ordered a regular mimosa, my sister-in-law had a bloody mary, and my wife ordered what she thought was a margarita (it literally said ""margarita"" in the title), but what she got was a Tecata beer can with some tequila poured in, salt on the rim of the beer can, and a lime. She tried it, and couldn't do it, so sent it back. My mimosa was okay, but they overdo it on the orange juice and don't put enough champagne in there (a good mimosa should have carbonation, and this one just doesn't). I noticed they have these giant goblets of mimosas (the server tried to get me to order one), but that doesn't mean the mimosa in those giant goblets are actually good. PRICES: I remember this wasn't terrible, had the food/drinks been better. The portions are large enough to justify the prices, but when you've had an overall meh to bad experience, it's not enjoyable to pay typical brunch prices for it when you could've gone somewhere else. SERVICE: our server was nice, if not a little aloof (though she may have been new, so not holding that against her). I don't remember service being especially slow, but we were one of the only tables in the place at the time.  I wanted this place to be good because it's right around the corner from my apartment, and had it not been for my wife's experience, I probably would've rated it 3 stars. I wasn't impressed with what I got, but it was certainly better than what she got."
We had Da Claudio cater an event with various finger foods, and they did not disappoint!  The crostinis were delicious and varied (beet and sea bass, anyone?), the olive oil loaf was heavenly, and the mortadella was to die for.  Also there were these little octopus skewers - scrumptious!  The guys who brought it over were so passionate about their food - you could see their eyes light up in celebration of this delicious traditional cuisine.   Haven't tried a sit-down yet, but if the catering is any indication, I am looking forward to bringing a date here.
I am giving this place 3 stars based on food, service, and experience. First for food I ordered the fondue burger and my friend had the pot pie. We both found our orders ok. The fries and burger were not fresh so I was a little disappointed for paying 25$ for a burger I can get elsewhere for 10 bucks. Also don't expect some fancy cheese fondue all over your burger it's just some mushroom spread on the bun and they called it fondue. I even had to ask the waiter maybe that's just the ordinary burger and I got a laugh at. So that's where the 3 for service comes. Finally I don't understand why people love this place so much I mean at the end of the day it's really just ok.
Fun and sultry atmosphere, feels like you're on vacation in Cuba. Food and cocktails. Great happy hour with $1 oysters. Main courses were very generous in portion, can definitely be shared.
I've only ever ordered takeout/delivery from here because I don't see a point of waiting in line for this place especially since I live a few blocks away. Delivery/takeout doesn't take that long. If I do takeout, I can usually pick it up within 20 mins, delivery takes about 30-40 mins. In my opinion, Pure Thai is the best Thai restaurant in Hell's Kitchen. Their thai iced tea is AMAZING! Chicken Curry Puffs: I strongly recommend getting this. It's really delicious and flavorful with just the right amount of sweetness. Nakorn-patom Duck Noodles Soup: I LOVEEEEE this dish! I've only gotten it in mild, but they give you a small container of some kind of hot sauce and that adds a really nice kick. The duck is really tender and the broth is full of flavor. The noodles are also perfect (I get the thin rice noodles). Ratchaburi crab & pork dry noodles: This is Pure Thai's most popular dish. I love this dish because it's sooo rich in flavor, but it can get to be way too spicy for me if I try to finish it especially since the spiciness level is not adjustable. I've only gotten it with broth, but there is the option to get it dry.
I used to like this place a lot more until all these people started to come here. Lost its uniqueness. I still like the noodles but the neighborhoods changing and driving up the prices. But I hope this business does not shut down as it has been here for a while. All the other stores and restaurants are closing down because of the gentrification.   The price has gone up and now it's 5 dumplings for 2 dollars. Used to be 10 dumplings for 2.   It's good for a quick meal. But don't guarantee yourself a seat automatically as its small and a bit crowded
The place looks great, nicely designed, nice atmosphere, friendly staff.   After enjoying having many beers at their bar, I finally sat for dinner hoping to be blown away with quality food, but was Unfortunately, disappointed.  The menu is poorly designed and not easy to read.  My heirloom tomato salad with burata was not edible.  The tomato was not ripe, not an heirloom tomato and certainly not a tomato a chef should let pass off as a good enough.  The salad came with too much balsamic, presentation was terrible and had to send away.  Short rib tacos ok, but Mayo slaw was overwhelming and taste of meat was destroyed by dumb heavy handed garnish.  Salmon entree itself was well prepared but grilled veggies looked and tasted mediocre.  Cocktails ordered were not made properly, will wait until they work out kitchen and menu before I eat there again. Lots to improve upon, will definitely hang at bar for beers until food and beverage program are solved.  Staff looks dedicated, hopefully it all works out, i would enjoy making this place a regular joint of mine.  Don't give up Queens Bully, you can fix this.
Went last night with mommy. Ordered churrasco Oswaldo and churrasco mixto.  Not tasty and very dry, (small portion ) Potatoes was flavorless.  Two stars for the hot sauce, really good!
Awful waitress attitude and rip off cocktail prices.   Take the ice cubes out of the glass and you are lucky to have a thimbleful of alcohol. Rip off!
Tasty ribs but poor service and a bit pricey. We would probably have spent more money here despite the cost because we are foreigners keen to experience the cuisine in Brooklyn but the sad service left us with a bad taste in our mouths.
The River Cafe has been around forever with lovely views, attentive professional service, and actually very goid food. So why 3 stars? I came with colleagues for dinner  and from the moment you walk in you are hit with the pungent smell of Lillys- Actually the whole restaurant, is overstocked with flowers, plants etc.,  which not only gives off a a sickening smell (not great when ordering food) but between the flowers and the dated decor - reminded me of a funeral parlor.
I love the concept here, but the execution is so flawed I'm not sure how people still go here (oh, right, tourists).  Two experiences for you, you decide... #1 - There are lines for everything here. Sometimes there's a line... to get in line. Came with a (beautiful) friend and we wanted a sandwich, a knish, a drink. Simple. But, at Katz's, that means waiting on three separate lines. So, you get one item, then stand in a packed line for another, then repeat. Whatever you got first is in no way warm. Oh, then you might not get a seat. All this would be moot if it was the greatest sandwich on Earth, but it's not. It's good, no doubt, but not THAT much better than any other Jewish deli who make their own pastrami. We're in NYC, there ARE other places to eat great food. Oh and the sandwiches are $22.50. Meat on rye. 'The rent is high' 'the meat is pricey!' they claim... as the owner purchases a multimillion dollar apartment. No thanks.  #2 - There's this insane ticket system they use because of the line situation listed above. Everyone who enters gets a ticket whether you're ordering something or not. Should you lose this ticket there is a $50 charge, which is absurd and arbitrary. So, you can go inside, hang with a friend while they waste their money, and if you don't have that ticket on the way out, you owe them $50. My first time here I came in, ordered, and while waiting I went to the counter to pay. They graciously accepted my payment. When I was done I dumped the tray into the trash, including the ticket, bc, you know, I paid already and no one told me otherwise. Well, that was a problem. I was called a thief and ordered to pay $50. They refused to check their system for my order and since it (was) cash only, there was no credit statement. They 'didn't remember me' from 15 in earlier (the place was relatively empty) and some BOUNCER told me I couldn't leave. So, they called the cops. The cops asked them to look at the tapes and they refused. Ultimately, I paid them so I could make my ride home, but this is literally the definition of robbery.  TL;DR, It's not worth it.
mac & cheese pancakes with cholula honey drizzled on top. not only was this place the cutest lil lunchbox diner, but the food was SO GOOD and my server (Dylan?) was probably the kindest person that lives in NYC. Y'all I loved it here. Honestly, when I walked by, I knew I wanted to give it a try, and then when I saw MAC & CHEESE PANCAKES on the menu out front, I practically ran in to claim my table. This combination sounds insane, but I tell ya it was good af. praise be to the brunch gods for this magical meal @momsmidtown
Great fish tacos for 7.50. Loving the artwork and fishtanks everywhere. Outdoor area has a zen like feel to it with the coy pond. Bartender made one of the best whiskey sours I've ever tasted. Would come back.
Horrible experience! Bad service. We waited for 30mins after ordering with no food coming and it is not first come first serve. The main dish didn't come till the end and we spent an hour just having appetizer. Won't come to this place again! It is now on top of my blacklist! Does not worth it.
My boyfriend and I came here for a spontaneous dinner date on a Wednesday evening around 8 pm. We called ahead, but they don't take reservations for two. We waited at the bar for about 10 min and enjoyed a glass of wine. The bartender was a little stand-offish but besides him, the service was fantastic. A nice man greeted us and brought us to the back of the restaurant to be seated. This place is absolutely beautiful! Dimly lit, romantic ambiance, perfect for a date!  Now the good part... the food!! We started off with the sheep's ricotta cheese and black truffle honey bruschetta. It's a must. We also tried the burrata barese. I highly recommend it. The cheese was so fresh and the flavors of the tomatoes, beans and balsamic really came together nicely. For our main entrees--- GET THE GNOCCHI di ricotta (there's a reason it's the first entree on the list). My boyfriend got the papardelle al ragu di vitello, but he substituted gnocchi and he loved his meal too. Shoutout to Angel, our awesome waiter who was always checking up on us and recommending his favorite dishes. Definitely try this place out if you're in the mood for some great Italian food!
Do I get the burger or do I get the lobster roll?? Burger and Lobster has been on my list and by chance I walked by their new location. There was nothing stopping me, I was going! This was maybe 3:00pm on a Monday and it was very empty. I was seated and my server came asap! He was, HANDS DOWN, the best server I have ever had. I forgot his name (I think it was Aaron, but I might be wrong), but he was super friendly, attentive, informative, gave me suggestions, and just a pleasure to talk to! He wore glasses and had tattoos, if you go to either location (he said he worked at both) PLEASE ask for him!!! I decided on the lobster roll, I got The Seven Samurai, and yuuuuum!!! So good! Perfect balance of meat and mayo atop a nicely toasted bun. The cucumbers were a nice touch as well. Burger and Lobster also sports some wicked shoestring fries. Fast food places need to take note, because theirs don't compare to the ones here. Having a salad on the side is almost comical given your meal, but that mini salad has a solid amount of substance to it and is nice to munch on. Or... make you feel less guilty! I opted for a mocktail made with ginger and peach puree, which was okay but I would get a different drink next time.  Absolutely loved my time there. I told my friend who took her GF there (who is also my friend) and they had a fantastic time! In fact, one of them went to Maine soon after the trip and enjoyed her lobster roll from B&L more! That's really saying something. I'm totally returning and going for the lobster next time.
Good but expensive cocktails. Very poor service. I would review the food but I have been sitting here for half an hour trying to get the waitress's attention so I can place an order.
Look, there's no good way to say this: I was served dramatically under-cooked chicken. The carrot on the plate was delicious! But, yeah, I almost died. The restaurant is lovely. The servers are professional and handled the Case of the Undercooked Chicken 100% appropriately. But, I can't say I would go back. And, I may be off chicken for a long way. Seriously, kitchen staff -- you could have killed someone.
Used to love this place! It's a shame-went there this evening and found a roach in my mezze platter. I will not be going back to this neighborhood favorite.
The outdoor space is incredible! I love the atmosphere..you really feel transported away from NYC. I felt like I was in the middle of the country, in a small town! They have plenty of space and it was the perfect place for a party.  The food here isn't memorable. Why do they package everything in airtight containers? It's so strange because they are wasting plastic containers and serving food that isn't freshly prepared to order. Never experienced that at a restaurant.  Turkey was chewy and deliver eggs lacked flavor. They were very wet from being refrigerated and sitting in their container. I wouldn't recommend the veggie burger either. Pickles were my favorite and drinks were delicious.
Very unpolite people and very bad service. Who cares how good is the food if it is served like that?
I've been going here since I was a kid and it used to be a descent place to eat. Ever since they were featured in several media outlets, the service and food quality have sharply declined over the years. Granted, service is never great in Chinatown, but they've seriously let all this media attention get to their heads. You can get much better eats at a multitude of places like Yummy Noodles, for example. Great NY Noodle's food is tired and complacent. Noodle soup isnt fresh, the broth tastes like pure msg and the roast duck is 70% fat, 30% meat.
Made a trip out here based on the reviews. One of the most expensive bowl of phos I've ever bought and it was disgusting. Overpriced and not good. None of the food is authentic in taste..very westernized and disappointing. To be fair the Vietnamese food in NY is subpar to begin with.
Hands down one of the better pies I've had, whether in NYC or anywhere else.  FAIR WARNING: Grimaldi's is not inexpensive AND it's cash only AND there are no slices. Whole pies only. Come prepared.  Had the traditional pie. No toppings. The two slices I had left passed a most important test and tasted just as good the next day, after a short bake in the toaster oven.
I had hear lots of buzz about Joe's Shanghai, and needed to check it out for myself. We came for lunch on a Saturday and there was about a 20 minute wait. You are given a ticket with a number on it and can grab a seat or stand outside. It being a winter day, this was not the not pleasant thing but it went by fast.  We were a party of four and seated at an eight person table, so we joined some other restaurant goers mid meal. We definitely ordered way too much food, but it all sounded so good and we wanted to give everything a try!  The main reason to come to Joe's is for the Xiao Long Bao (Soup Dumplings). They come with eight to an order, which is a pretty good amount for sharing. We started with this and they were delicious! The soup inside was rich in flavor, and the the pork was great too.  We also started off with an order of Scallion pancakes, Shanghai Noodle Soup, and Shanghai Chives & Shrimp with Meat Wonton in Broth (wonton soup on appetizer page). The Scallion Pancake was delicious, I had never tried one before though so I don't have much to compare it to. The Wonton Soup was definitely my favorite of the two soups. The noodles in the Shanghai were much thicker than I had expected.  For our main meal we shared the Sliced Chicken with Black Mushrooms and Bamboo Shoots and Shrimp Fried Rice. I was not the biggest fan of the sauce on the chicken, but it was cooked well and came with plenty of food. The Shrimp Fried Rice was delicious, just like your typical fried rice.  Definitely beware when ordering when your eyes! We had tons of food to take home. Overall, great meal though!
"Joju is a wonderful place to get fresh, flavorful Banh Mi.  Upon first walking into this trendy spot, I was skeptical. The bright colors, kitschy signs and cute drawings smelled like a tourist trap in comparison to the other restaurants on the block. But the flavors in each banh mi made me realize why this place is so popular. The Kakuni pork belly was power packed with sweet soy flavors embedded in fatty cuts of pork. The ""Hot Chick"" had a copious amount of earthy lemongrass chicken. Each banh mi was brightened with large amounts of pickled daikon and carrots, and cilantro. The bread was firm and slightly chewy, serving as a fresh envelope for the contents of each sandwich. We ordered our sandwiches spicy, but didn't taste a hint of spice; luckily, a fresh bottle of Sriracha was at each table.  In all, we enjoyed our experience. I'd recommend this place for a quick bite to eat in Elmhurst. I look forward to trying more banh mi on their menu."
Food: 3.0/5.0 Service: 2.5/5.0 Value: 3.5/5.0 Decor: 2.5/5.0 Overall: 3.0/5.0 People have their quirks, and the Yelp masses are no exception.  Every once in a while, I'll happen upon a highly decorated spot only to come out sorely disappointed.  After finally making it to L&B, I can report that disappointed, oh, I was. What can I say?  Yes, it's much better than Ellios or the french bread stuff they served in middle school.  And yes, I'm not the biggest fan of squares (but hey, I've been to PSP and am willing to admit it's pretty good).  The nice and puffy crust is admittedly done well... but it's just 'so Brooklyn' to talk up L&B like they're serving the greatest piece of puffed up cheese bread on the planet when in reality what's driving the love is some combination of nostalgia, groupthink, or an unhealthy love for puffy square slices.  At least don't call it pizza like it's real real pizza.  You guys are in New York for crying out loud.  Give it a try, but really really really keep your expectations in check.  And get a spumoni.
I waited to eat pork buns until the very end of my meal, and that was a mistake. I really could have eaten 5 or 6, but I didn't save room. Liver pate was smooth and creamy, and I felt it was the highlight of the meal for me. Wonderful cocktails, plenty of items to share, and great service. We skipped desert to hit up the Momofuku Milk Bar across the street (which is also great), but next time I vow to try the desserts at Ssam instead.
For the price, it is definitely good and filling. I've had better hand pulled noodle soups. I had the pan fried dumplings and the tang yuan. The person I was with had a beef tendon noodle soup. Very few vegetables. The decor reminds me of small hole in the wall snack shops in China where you could get 8-10 yuan meals. Think metal plates and stools lined up at a tiny wood table bar. 3.5/5 stars.
Typical corporate finance crowd. Seems like everyone is simply here to feel like somebody. The decor is very sleek and elegant, dark and loud as hell. Packed like sardines and you have to yell to speak to those next to you. Can't even enjoy your drink if you found one that's good. I had 2 glasses of different wines and they both tasted like CILANTRO. Booooo
Went there today for a quick lunch with my friends! The ambience of this place is definitely very nice and eye catching. It's rustic and creates more of a typical hawker style thai food scene (which I love). In terms of food, I wasn't very satisfied. I guess the reason behind that was because I walked in with high expectation based on the decor. I ordered the Pad Kra Pa or the (minced chicken with basil) dish which came with jasmine rice. It was somewhat bland in terms of flavoring. By that I mean the dish was very westernized. (as someone who grew up in bangkok) I could definitely tell the dish wasn't like how I remembered. I could barely taste the basil and I asked for high spicy and it wasn't even spicy at all and leaned more towards being a little bland. I also tried the Ratchaburi noodles. That dish was good and would recommend and the staffs there are probably the nicest people out there and because of them I giving one more star. But other than that I don't think I would be returning here anytime soon.
"WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE IN NYC SO FAR. terrible, just absolutely terrible.  I was born and raised in Peru So I know what authentic peruvian food tastes and looks like. I ordered the Jalea, and what you would expect to be a plate full of crunchy, fresh fish, I get a big old pile of soggy, few days old seafood with human hair as decor. REVOLTING. I must have taken about two bites out of the plate before deciding there was no way I would finish this because 1) I could have ended up in the hospital based on what was being fed to me and 2) my peruvian dignity could not allow it.   I waved over the waitress, who seemed to be of eastern European origins - Perhaps Russian; mind you I only mention this to facilitate identifying said server upon arrival. I politely informed her that I would like to return my plate because of the reasons stated above. She then excuses herself for a moment to speak with the hostesses in the back to address the hair issue. I reckon It is fair to mention that these three hostesses all had long, dark hair either up in a ponytail or neatly clipped. However, the hostesses appeared to have access into the kitchen (the restaurant is structured so you have full view of the kitchen so that it why I make this statement as I was sitting directly across facing the kitchen) where obviously food is being prepared  without anything restraining loose pieces of hair from falling into already served platters.  When confronting the hostesses, I could hear their quick responses of ""that's not my hair!"", ""Nope! wasn't me!"" (very professional) and that was that.  The server then approaches us (me and my gf) to tell me that the chefs told her that the food already comes prepares so there's not way there could have been a hair in it. OKAY HERE'S WHERE I REALLY GOT PISSED: Basically by stating that she is admiting that 1) the food (SEAFOOD) ISN'T freshly prepared, 2) the management/chefs of the restaurant give half a shit about whether or not you find human remains in your food and 3) are you insinuating that that's my hair in the blasfemia you call jalea??????? because 4) even if it is you don't tell that to your customers. Hello????  Anyway, she then had the audacity to state that I HAD to replace the Jalea with another item of the menu of the same price range. Hence, commences chaos.  I told her I did not want to replace anything for anything and That I would just like to return it please (and not get charged for what otherwise could have ended me up in the hospital). Her response? ""Oh right, you don't want to order something else because you already ate it all so you're full!"" (in a very standoffish attitude).  ?????????????? ARE YOU FFFFF KIDDING  ME At this point I was so flabbergasted by the service I just told her Okay whatever give me the fucking chicken - but just the chicken didn't cover the whole cost of the Jalea, so she kept on insisting I order some fries or salad to make up for it. OKAY, now I'm done playing nice and I Say you know what forget it I don't want anything take the chicken away I don't want to order anything from this restaurant because why would I?? I told her honestly I have never in my entire life had a problem with returning a fucking plate and that this was ridiculous. Mind you I told her I wanted to talk with the chefs the entire time but that never happened.  She seems to get what I'm trying to say and says okay I'll bring you the check. The checked was supposed to come with just an order of a Lomo Saltado totaling about 25$ or so.  the check comes in at $43 are you fucking kidding me. This lady just tried to still charge me for the mother fucking Jalea. whatever I'm done typing bout this bitch ass disgusting excuse for peruvian restaurant. Seriously, don't come here.  (I got the bill fixed and paid what I RIGHTFULLY had to pay but the process gave me PTSD)"
This place has gone downhill significantly since it first opened. Now that this place has gotten more clients, the owner has become a lot more rude and impatient with clients. There were no thank yous for orders and she's constantly trying to rush you during lunchtime.  I've experienced service issues with my orders several times. Once, I paid for extra veggies, but my order did not turn out to have extra veggies at all. Will not be back again. This week, the owner gave me the wrong order, then snatched it away from me and gave me the correct order without any apologies. The way she snatched it out of my hands was also incredibly rude.  Food here has also gone way downhill. They must have changed the cook, because food here used to be light on sauce and spice. My dish this time was extra oily and way over cooked with salt and spices. It was very greasy and unhealthy.
"The Quick: Not the best dining experience. Overall the food was a disappointment except for the lemon sole which was amazing.  The Details: The restaurant is charming and on an adorable block. I've heard amazing things and was so excited to try this spot.  I was part of a party of 5, and 4 of us were unhappy with our apps and meals.  To start, the lobster tacos were fairly bland and had an embarrassingly small amount lobster (and were $7 each?!). The ""rare tuna"" entree was extremely overcooked, the branzino was flavorless, the ravioli were undercooked and chewy, and the crab meat in the crab stuffed flounder was over-seasoned and gritty.  All four of us rated our dishes 2/3 stars, and would not order them again... Plus they were extremely pricey!  The only saving grace was my mothers dish, the lemon sole. It was fantastic. We all left our dishes half eaten and stared longingly at her meal.  The Damage: ~$250 plus tip for 4 people, not worth it unless you just get the sole."
Two stars for food, zero stars for service. My husband is Mexican, from Texas. So we've been on a quest to find good Mexican food in NYC for quite some time. Sunset Park is definitely the hub for decent, yummy Mexican fare. Tacos Matamoros does serve up good food (especially the tamales), but its not good enough to make up for their lacking service. Waitresses ignore customers and generally stand around while you wait and wait for food and checks. They're apologetic and smile but its consistently like this. Other male staff (not sure of their roles) ignore you altogether. I think that because of hipsters flock to this place, they don't need to be nice/hospitable. For people who can tolerate this sort of thing, their food is good. The tacos are excellent and their tamales are the best in Sunset Park. However, I won't ever be back because I can get great Mexican food at home and decent fare elsewhere. I don't need to be treated like a restaurant is doing me a favor by having me there.
Good but far from great food especially the pastries.   Burgers are good quality but fail due to run of the mill quality buns.   Service while friendly was incredibly slow.
I worked in the area temporarily on Amsterdam and 65th Street.  According to the reviews, the food sounds great.  A coworker of mine highly recommended the food.  Even though their website states that they deliver from West 60th St to West 125th Sts, they refused to deliver to  West 65, which IS within their delivery area.  Why advertise what you can't deliver?? That made no sense.
Nothing to write home about. Okay food, somewhat over priced and not getting your monies worth. Pasta is pasta ... didn't like tomato sauce w garlic just doesn't mix ... onions w tomato sauce make sense ... true Italian knows.  Fish didn't have much taste and ambiance was okay... it was over crowded but not worth the wait or food.
I came here for brunch. I got the chicken and waffles. It was soooo good. They have $25 pitchers of mimosa. First I got the blueberry and it was disgusting. So much purée it was just too thick. Then tried the blood red mimosa and it was just okay. Didn't taste much champagne in these mimosas. Service was just okay amour waiter was kinda rude. At the end after we paid our waiter came back up to the table and made a comment about not getting enough of a tip. It was really inappropriate. We ended up leaving more of a tip because we felt bad but I spoke to the manager and the waiter afterwards and explained that the approach used was very unprofessional and frankly rude. Because of this and the non-champagne filled mimosas I doubt ill be back
I like the atmosphere here because of the amazing decor inside, plus the well clean table. Also their workers are very organized, that's why they can provide good quality service even in busy times. Most of the cider options hail from the New England region, in keeping with the restaurant's longstanding farm-to-table ethos, but there are also options from France, Spain and Switzerland. Get the off menu burger in the tap room (and sometimes if your really nice in the dining room). Swiss and cheddar, house smoked bacon, and a house made sesame bun! Although It was a bit pricey here, still it was worth the visit.
Romantic and open, 49 is a space you want to occupy. We came super early for a birthday dinner and got serviced right away. They were attentive and accommodating, great sign as we waited expectantly for our drinks and company. I ordered the watermelon margarita, but happily dabbled in the brooklynite, Moscow mule and skate & rye with my gracious buddies... all decent, nothing mind-blowing.  Apps- escargot: sorrowfully a miss being that it was not pretty and swimming in a salt bath, barrata- decent and creamy as it should be, mussels done well but minuscule- it looked a lot but would leave a person aching for more and water, the Calamari- highlight of the evening seriously. It was cooked to perfection with a generous panko dusting, hot and fresh off the fryer- definitely the reason if nothing else, to revisit 49 again.  Entrees: Rib eye- tender and juicy with a good sear, seafood platter- oversalted although cooked well with the exception of slightly overdone head on large shrimp, what a shame. The Paella, is another reason to revisit. Juicy al dente kernels of rice cooked in butter (a lot of butter) and Parmesan over seafood broth, it was decadent. We all had more or less trouble with the carbonara- I wanted so much to love this, but love is a tricky thing. Way Heavy handed on the pecorino sauce, it was overly salty (a common theme here it seems) saucily cheesy to the point of bitter. It was not good to our party but I am a huge cheese and pasta lover. Sorrowfully I did not love this.  The mousse in a jar was so cute and mild- a good ending to a fun-filled evening. To the chocolate addict, it could be much richer but chocolate is chocolate no matter how you slice it. Quite possibly the biggest disappointment to me, personally was the creme brulee. Being that it's my favorite dessert, I do have very high standards when it comes to brûlée. It had the perfect glass top where one had to hit it to break it, I'll give them brownie points for that- but it goes downhill from there. The custard was loose and runny, lacking substance and flavor throughout. I can't, I'm so sad.  While beautifully maintained with haphazardly jungle whimsy that is so quintessential NYC style, 49 Monroe aims high but misses the mark by a lot when it comes to food. But hey, it's a good starting point- it can only go up from here. 49 should keep their momentum by building and learning at every turn.
All the xiao long bao here are really good but the veggie dumpling and sticky rice dumplings r just eh. The beef noodle soup is good too
Cuba is fun, decent cocktails, and average food.  They had live music the night we went for dinner, which was nice, although it made the place a bit too noisy.  I had an octopus salad and a grilled chicken dish with rice and beans. All fine, but nothing special.  I might go back if I was in the neighborhood, but more  likely to try other options.
"We decided to eat dinner at this place after attending the cat circus located at the Brooklyn Muse warehouse-looking building. The area at this time at night (10 PM to 12 AM) was very shady! We felt we were going to get shanked, and the entrance of the restaurant was confusing to find. The main entrance of the place looks like a side entrance and has uneven cement by the entrance to the staircase which may be a hazard (someone could trip). There were two extremely loud and unpleasant noises during our dinner, mostly coming from the metal giant garage door/barrier that opened and closed next door. The noises were so loud and sudden that I jumped up my seat, and others were also surprised of the commotion. The tables outside were somewhat a fail because the ice from my drinks melted (due to hot and humid weather) and dripped through the crevices of the table and wet my leg, ankles, feet, etc. We ordered the ""Guido"" pizza and it was very filling. Not one of the best pizzas I had, since I wasn't a fan of the bitter rabe, but I admired how their pizzas are made (fire-wood/oven style). Our initial female waitress was somewhat snobby but after she left her shift, we had a pleasant male waiter who did his job greatly. Not sure if we would come here again given the shady and graffiti-ed area during the evening time. P.S. Cash only! They do not accept any cards."
"My family truly enjoys eating out. We love the experience...food, people, and memories. Let me tell you Al Mar will be one we will never forget bc of the arrogant, disrespectful, and condescending manager. We arrived on 4th of July, 3rd party to enter. They had happy hour going on since they don't serve dinner til after 6 pm.  We ordered a couple pints and waited for 6 pm. At 614 we ordered. Meatballs as a starter followed by short rib and shrimp linguine.  People started to arrive and we realized they were getting their food before us.  In fact, the table next to us, party of three, arrived 15 mins after us, got the wrong order AND received their fixed food before we received ours. Numerous customers were getting their meals and after 54 mins waiting I couldn't take it anymore. I asked the waiter and the manager to check on the order. After 13 more mins we finally get the meal. 10 mins into it out baby gets fussy (bc we were waiting sooooo long) and we had to box it up and go.  Manager comes over to check on the table next to us and before he leaves catches a glance of me looking. I said it was unacceptable that we waited so long. He said it's the 4th of July. I said we were 3rd party here!  After I said listen it's bs you guys took so long he raises his voice at me and says, ""what, you want something for free!!""  At that point I got extremely upset. That insult was it. Especially after we had left our cash on table paying for everything. This arrogant SOB insulted us and I gotta tell you he is the reason why that place is run so terribly. As I told him after his insult, it's his lack of leadership and respect that I will ensure all Yelp is aware of this incident.  I'm sorry, I've waited for food on busy days many times. I don't mind that. What I mind is an a$$hole manager insulting my family when he clearly knows he's in the wrong.  Al Mar, you failed. And it's you manager on duty who should never be allowed on duty again."
Ate here for an early dinner. I ordered the steak sandwich and ate only half of it and left with leftovers. On my way to work, I got a really awful stomach ache which was odd. It happened pretty soon after my meal and I knew it must have been something I ate. My boyfriend who had dinner with me experienced no stomach pains.... It wasn't until I looked at my leftovers that I noticed the meat was almost completely raw. This is not 'medium rare'. So..... Guess the moral of the story is... Don't trust that they cook the meat completely through. Or the cook doesn't know what 'medium rare' means. And... I don't know who it was; either the boss or manager or someone with authority, but they were yelling loudly at who I assumed to be an employee. It was disruptive and made me feel uncomfortable during my meal.  It's a shame. I really like Westville and their emphasis on using fresh ingredients... But seems like this Westville's ingredients were a bit too fresh. I'll stick to the Hudson location from now on.
**Cash only, no reservations ** Buttery, explosive, and spicy! I love crawfish and shrimp boil, it's one of my favorites that I have very high expectations on. I've had the best, and after moving to NY I've been on the search for a good one since the seafood boil craze took over in NY. Unfortunately, I've had a lot of disappointments until I found this place!  Come before 5 to get your name down (they open at 5). It's a busy place and there is no mercy if everyone in your party hasn't arrived by the time your name is called. If you arrive after 5, expect to wait one to two hours. But, worth it.  I went with a big group and we tried everything. My favorite is the crawfish (but you must know how to eat it the southern way or you won't appreciate it to the fullest) and the shrimp with The Boil Special in Spicy. I love spicy but I couldn't handle the Fire.  They have a GV location that does take reservations that I'm already planning a visit to!
This is our second time here. The first time was a Friday night and it wasn't too busy. This time we came in for lunch and it's extremely busy.  We ordered two ramen dishes the Tan Tan Men, the Tonkotsu and the lotus root appetizer.  First let me start with we thought the lotus root was fried as in the photo. But it was not. It came out ice cold. We asked if maybe we could exchange it for another appetizer but the lady said that they were to busy and pointed to a line of tickets. Fine. So we nixed that. We received our ramen pretty fast considering how busy they were.  They were ok. My husband asked to have his spicy and my dish was already spicy. They were tasty. His noodles were very this like vermicelli. I though that was weird.  So we got our check and I was looking at it to see if they took off the lotus root. They had but there was a 50 cent charge Add Spicy on the check. Seriously? It's not about the money. It's about the weird fact that they do not supply hot sauce but they charge you to add some spice to your dish. I don't know. Weird.  Bottom line: eh
Bottom line : sooo many better places in Chinatown.  Pass this one up! I ordered the beef brisket soup.  The beef wasn't even edible. It was real fatty and chewy.  The broth was also VERY oily.  Over priced at over $9.00 bucks for lunch.  One positive was the service was much better then many of the places in the area.
For the folks who are craving delicious soup dumplings but can't handle the Chinatown crowd, this is the place for you. I am super lucky this is right by my Brooklyn office.  On a normal day, I'll typically order the garlic cucumber salad (extremely refreshing) and 2 orders of the 4 piece pork soup dumplings.The broth in the dumplings is great, full of thickness and flavor! The cold cucumber salad adds a nice balance to the hot meal.  On a more hungover day (but worth a bit more $), I definitely recommend the Braised Pork Meatballs Over Rice with Egg. The meat is again, very flavorful, and the fried egg completes the meal. I'll usually order a hot and sour soup with this as well.  Just a few tips: Beware of the lunch crowd which usually comes through at noon. I sometimes make the run for it around 11:30 so I don't have to wait in line. And be prepared to wait a few extra minutes if you order the soup dumplings, it is always prepared hot and fresh. Seating has communal tables and bar seating which for the most part, is limited due to the crowd.  FIVE STARS all the way. Yaso Tangbao, you keep bringing me back.
I've been to this place twice. The food is good but the wait time isn't worth it at all. My party of three waited over an hour to get our food at the table. When we asked for garlic bread, the waiter said a dollar more even though it's supposed to be free. On another occasion, I ordered some food to go and it took an hour and 40 mins to come. When I complained they looked at me like I did something wrong. No apologies, no tartar sauce or lemon with to go order, just gtfo rude attitude. Both times it was also pretty damn expensive. Place is also pretty small and always packed with people stepping all over each other. Wouldn't be going back for sure.
I came here with my family of 8 (6 adults and 2 kids) for a Chinese New Year celebration. We all ordered from the prix fixe menu and it definitely did not disappoint!  We started off with many appetizers that kept coming one after another. I lost track of how many dishes we got at the end because it felt like it was never ending! Every dish that was served to us was cooked to perfection. Whether it be the flavor and the spicy kick to certain dishes, it was an enjoyable celebration.  The staff was also very accommodating and attentive to our table even though the entire restaurant was packed! Even though we came as a family, it's a great place for a romantic date or even a lunch/dinner with your friends. Thanks Traif!
Just dropping by the neighborhood, somehow we end up there because of the Happy hour sign.   Very small and tiny place which is OK. However, only two bartenders and very limited service.  You just have to walk up there.  The price for regular wine is a little over price because I can see the bottle do not cause more than $15, but they charge $6 per charge.  So, 50% of benefits easy.   The HH foods was OK.   The decor is simple and nothing special about it.  It's a place for business.  I didn't catch the female bartenders name, but she need to smile and be more friendly to non-local customer.  Bring in the smile and you can get more tips.  U know.
Stopped by at this place during the Chinese New Year celebrations. It was a trek to get though the crowd. Of course, the line was long. ;( Once seated, we ordered Soup Dumplings and Lollipop Chicken for appetizers. Soup Dumplings were amazing. Lollipop Chicken was good as well, but the extra fat threw me off a bit.  Then came the entrées. We ordered Wonton Soup and Devilish Ramen. We were a little full from appetizers, so I didn't get to enjoy the big bowl of seafood ramen. I asked for super spicy, but they fell short.  I'm still coming back for just Soup Dumplings though.
"Great outdoor space that is full of ""fun""  Came here on a nice sunny day and was remarkably surprised that this place existed in Brooklyn. I cannot comment on the food, because I consumed all of my calories in liquid form. The place has about 3-4 different frozen drunk slushies ($9). You can even request all of the flavors mixed together; I loved my mojito/piña colada/margarita mix.  There is a huge outdoor area, which is pretty kid-friendly. I kind of resembles a carnival of sorts.  The only annoying thing (a star deduction) is this place is Cash only. Cash only!!! What is this, 1983? There should be no reason that a restaurant with booze is cash only."
"Average pasta, great ambiance! Instagram worthy pasta place, but the taste was only okay! Made reservations for 8:30, but due to delays on the MTA trains, we changed the reservations to 9:15 because we were not sure when the subway will run. We arrived 8:45 and notified the hostess that we arrived early. Needless to say, the restaurant was packed and we were not seated until 9:15.  We ordered a Peach Sangria and a Pinot Grigio to start. The peach sangria was unimpressive and to be frank, just white wine with peach cubes and lots and lots of ice! The Pinot Grigio was great! We also ordered the Tuna Tataki for appetizer! It was simple, but absolutely delicious! The tuna was perfectly seared and the wasabi sauce was invigorating! We had to order the Parmigiano Spaghetti as we had seen it all over Instagram and Facebook and as a lover of uni, I had to get Linguine Ai Ricci Di Mare! The Spaghetti Con Prosciutto E Parmigiano was made tableside in a big cheese wheel! It was absolutely a joy to watch, but my SO as a lover of cheese was unimpressed. Even though the pasta was perfectly al dente, the sauce lacked flavor and the prosciutto was typical deli meat. The Uni Linguine had perfect al dente pasta with a flavorful pink sauce! However, the most disappointing part was the uni! It was possibly the worst uni I have ever had! You could taste that the uni was past its date with its disgusting ""fishiness"" (not the good kind of fishy) spread entirely in the mouth! Absolutely not fresh! To wash the taste off, we ordered the House Tiramisu. It was good the first couple of bits, but soon, there was too much cocoa powder on top that coated the roof of my mouth. It was an average dessert with few bits of fruit cut up on the plate. Will probably not be returning!"
We came here on a Saturday afternoon many but around 5pm there was no wait . We had the ma and cheese appetizer which was delicious!!! And we had the queso which was blah (so-so) . The drinks were superb I had the berry good time and my fiancé had the Texas cooler. I had a bacon burger which arrived to me without bacon after informing the Waitress she apologized and gave me the option of getting a whole new burger which would take 20 min or a side of bacon which will take 5 mins of course I chose the side of bacon but by the time it came out I was over it I could barely fit the bacon in the burger my bread started getting soggy. My fiancé had the 50/50 burger he said he liked it he also said that the beans and coleslaw were good.  When we arrived the presented the waitress that we checked in through yelp and got a free side we each checked it so we each got a free side however on the bill only one came off, but to rectify the situation the waitress gave us two free moonshine shots valued at 7$ each so we didn't make a big deal for the 4.99 that the fries cost.  I would go here again I would also recommend it to others
I had really high expectations for this place but unfortunately was highly disappointed. I made a reservation in advance for brunch and the staff was really nice we gave them a card to hold our reservation and they did not charge us for the people that did not show up. The place is small and cute but don't think I'd be coming back here. My friends and I ordered steak and eggs and I am not a lover of runny eggs the chef was unable to go cook out eggs a little longer or even scramble them... literally NO adjustments could have been made, which I honestly find a little ridiculous. We were beyond baffled. On top of that we also asked if the eggs could maybe be substituted for the papas and they said no... like what if I was allergic to eggs? The drinks were really good which was a plus the waitress kept refilling our cups.  To top all of this the manager (I think he was the manager, not sure) he came to ask us if we were dissatisfied for some reason because apparently we didn't leave enough tip but we didn't even tip to begin with be left our total and expected change back to then leave a tip like all normal places do.   The staff was all really nice but honestly there's no options here. Happy hour brunch special was $15 for an hour when most place are either an hour and a half-2 hrs. This place is not worth the hype
"Yummy date night proposal with a new friend presented us with a culinary experience not too distant from the swamps of Louisiana.  Crawfish Etouffee and Jambalaya was on tonight's menu. Decor: When you walk in, it's hard to tell whether you are at a neighborhood bar or your cat lady aunt's kitchen. A very cozy & eclectic feel here at Sugar Freak lending to the down-home feeling! We were sat at a table near the back of the quaint restaurant. Our place mats? You guessed it; pictures of all of our nation's presidents with Mr. Obama right in the middle. Again, just like at auntie's house! LOL Waitress was friendly and food came to the table quickly.  Dinner:The Crawfish Etouffee had a viscous consistency and a soft oceanic taste. It was lightly seasoned but had a bit of heat on the back end. You could taste the fresh cracked pepper. The Jambalaya was the star of the night. It lead to a speechless evening as we enjoyed our meal! The Jambalaya also lay atop a bean puree textured tomato based ""sauce"". I put the quotes because I'm not really sure.  What I was sure about was that it was dog-gone good.  A great meal cooked by your crazy cat lady aunt that knows how to throw down in the kitchen.  Now, before I go, let me not forget to mention the fried banana pudding.  A frozen ball of sweet creamy goodness, battered in funnel cake and fried to perfection. Needless to say, it was a delicious ending to a phenomenal meal.  Thank you Sugar Freak... why are you called Sugar Freak?"
I've been here three times with three different groups and have had a great experience each time!  It can sometimes be hard to get a seat here, but if you know New York eateries, that is sometimes the best indication that you should wait and see what the buzz is about. Lucky for you, dear Yelp reader, you can make your reservations straight through your Yelp app!  Although I haven't eaten it, three people over the course of two groups/visits have all praised their rack of lamb. Think, a clean plate. Yes, friends, get the lamb if you eat lamb.  I've had their burger, which is fun since it's served on an English muffin. I've also had their pasta which was also great! The decor is low lit, with a central bar and great cocktails (Manhattan, yep; Old Fashioned; check; Martini; got ya). Bathrooms are 3 single-stall, all-gender bathrooms.  Whether you're grabbing a bite before a show, or just finding a good restaurant on a Monday night, satisfy your belly and libations at Bea!
Great drinks! Kiss kiss bang bang was wonderful, bubbly and the perfect blend of sweet and sour. The eggplant chips are a must try- yum! The crunch is perfect and the honey dipping sauce gives them a guilty feel :).
Worst service ever. I get that the place is small but they are really rude about the fact that they lack space for a party of 3...plus if you are a party of 3 and one of you just decides to stand, they will not accept that and kick you out.
Super cheap and the best dumplings and ox tail soup I've had in the city. The place is small and kind of a dump but the food makes up for it.
"Thanks to the fellow yelpers for suggesting a fab place in the neighborhood. This place gets filled up pretty fast during lunch time and with very little sitting space its hard to find a corner (Shared table) with your food. The tacos which I tried were the chicken, pork belly and spicy pork though I couldn't tell on from another all of them were really good! Only complaint would be that the meat was fried a tad bit too much. There is a huge collection of hot sauces, so you do not have to fight with others for ""a bottle"" of hot sauce like other places. The breakroom fries were dipped in deliciousness and is a must try and so was the mint lemonade. I do plan to return soon!"
We have been here for brunch a half a dozen times. Very nice environment and service is excellent. We order mozzarella and tomato sandwiches.  The bread is delicious and the cheese is authentic italian. I have been here once for dinner. Food and pricing average nothing special.
As a whole, I'd rate it as a 3.5, but their green curry is totally worth rounding up to 4 stars! Firstly the decor of the place is absolutely breath taking. From their gold hanging lights to their gold leaves, it definitely leaves quite the impression. They have three different menus, which leaves plenty of room to satisfy even the picky eaters. Would highly recommend ordering yourself a Thai iced tea to start, it's probably some of the best I've tasted... ever. For your main course, do yourself a favor and get their green curry with the crispy duck. Omg.. it will seriously blow your mind. Has a bit of a kick, but as a whole, it's lick your bowl clean type of good. (A bit spicy, but I generally can't handle heat) I also ordered their wings which were a bit sub par, along with their complimentary rice balls. I would pass them up to save yourself more room for the good stuff (green curry) but definite bonus points for the gesture. Also got another dish to share.. completely forgot the name of it, but it consisted of beef, eggplant, peppers and onions. Although it was good, i think next time I'd opt out to sharing two different curry dishes. The red curry is next on my list for a return visit The place is decently sized so medium to large groups would be accommodated, assuming you called ahead. I went in with no reservations, as a party of two and was immediately seated around 6pm on a weekday. The waiting staff if very prompt and is always filling your water glass immediately as it starts to get low... More brownie points!!
This place was STRAIGHT FIRE. Literally though, it was so spicy my mouth was on fire and I had liquid coming out of every possible area on my face (sweat, snot, you name it). I picked up pad see ew for dinner after a workout class during the week and it was SO SPICY. I didn't even ask for it y'all. I asked for medium T-T, but little did I know.... I honestly am not sure why it was so spicy, haven't seen other reviewers mention this so I feel like maybe it was a mistake but I have not eaten a spicier meal in New York (which is saying something, I really like spicy food and have a pretty high tolerance). I could feel every mouthful clawing its way down my esophagus. I'm conflicted because the portion was very fair and it was really yummy under the spice but it was also SO SO HOT. I had to drink milk with this meal. Because of this I don't think it justifies even 4 stars. Bonus though, the salt from my tears streaming out of my eyes really complemented the noodles.
"I am a regular customer here. Huge fan of soba so I would come here after work. I came early evening on Saturday night so understandably it was starting to get busy.  So I sat alone at the bar and had a quick dinner and a drink (came out to 56.91 dollars including tip) and was ready to leave with my jacket on waiting for my bill and credit card back. The host comes up to me and said ""can you leave? There are other customers waiting."" I got so offended. That is not how you treat any customers, especially if I was waiting for my bill and credit card back and wasn't hanging around on purpose. After I explained, no apologies for the misunderstanding was given. She just walked away. I won't be coming here again."
Food was delicious! But service awful. Probably because we didn't order alcohol. Sorry we don't drink. Not all Asian tourist don't tip. We are American tourist first time in ny.
One of the nicer bars in midtown.  Upstairs and downstairs options.  Upstairs is more of a classic New York bar. Nice bar,  good beer selection, good service. I actually left my card at the bar one night and then didn't even charge me extra. Pretty good of them. Not too expensive.  Downstairs is more of a speakeasy situation. Nice food selection even if it seems a bit hipster. They struggle with speed of service to the tables at times but it is hard to know whether it is the layout of the joint or way that it is staffed.  Either way it's good downstairs! Great vibe.
"To be honest, I haven't had a lobster roll this good in a while.   The burger with the lobster, what a mammoth!! So good though!  I'd suggest everyone get something diff on the menu so you all get a bite.  Worth it to split this stuff. Wierd situation between bar and floor.  Apparently you can't just ""order a drink"" at the bar, then be at a table.  Two separate entities, my friend was told he literally ""couldn't be served"".  But apart from that... slammin food.  ** get the sauces !!! They make the sides !!! The creme fraiche and the aioli.  So good I was pouring that shit on errythang yo!"
This place is absolutely awesome. Their food is great! Love the Steak torta with el yucateco green hot sauce. I come all the way from staten island just to eat here. Highly recommend it UPDATE: They removed the steak, chicken tortas but instead replaced them with a greasier kind of meat and turned such good fresh food to something found at a checkers or Sonic.  5 stars to 1
The pizza here is PERFECT. This has got to be one of the most underrated and under hyped places in NYC. I came here for dinner last night with my boyfriend, and coincidentally it was national pizza day! I would definitely recommend making a reservation. It was packed, and although there weren't any people waiting outside, every table was full and people kept coming in. We had a reservation for 7:45, and although we were 10 minutes late, we were seated right away, and at the cutest little corner table! I was so glad we were seated there because it was tucked away, and the other tables looked cramped because there is only a small amount of space to walk between the bar and the wall on the other side. The tables lining the wall are also high tops, which can be uncomfortable. They also have a back room, but I didn't get a look at it. Photos make it seem more casual and with higher ceilings.  The space is dark, with little bare bulbs lighting the restaurant and an industrial chic feel to it. There are black and white photos lining the wall and cute flowery wallpaper on the other wall.  Service was great, everyone was friendly and the food came out quickly. Our waitress helped us decide what size pizza and ravioli to get. We asked for more bread and it came to us quickly as well.  We each got a glass of red wine, which were poured quite generously. We then ordered a small ravioli (tomato and parm) and a small (6 LARGE slices) Rubirosa Supreme, which had tomato, mozzarella, pepperoni, meatballs, and garlic. The ravioli came out first, and while I thought the portion was a bit small, it was seriously amazing. I would have ordered a large if I'd gotten just that as my entree though. The flavor was strong and just simply amazing. The texture of the ravioli was great as well.  The pizza came out shortly after and we were glad we got a small! It was the perfect amount of food for two people. The pizza was hot, the crust was super thin, and the flavor was absolutely what I want pizza to taste like. It wasn't burned in any places and every bite was just delicious. The ingredients were super fresh. There were tons of pepperonis and I loved the basil on it. The tomato sauce was juicy and there was the perfect amount on it. I'd say this is one of the best pizzas I have had in NYC. I liked it better than Di Fara!  Our meal came out to about $66, without tip. I think it's reasonable for Nolita, and everything was really great. This is probably the best restaurant I've reviewed on Yelp so far.
Nice local bar.  Not worth a trip.  I stopped by after taking the Ikea ferry to Brooklyn.  Maybe a ten minute walk from the pier. I started with a very nice Ramos Gin Fizz. Brunch menu was OK but I need to try more of the menu before adding an extra star. After a second visit for lunch - a solid three rating.  Not special enough to be worth four stars but I will go back. Staff is very amiable and prices are inexpensive for decent/good food.
We are frequent customers at Blend LIC and thought we would give Blend Astoria a try. Unfortunately, we had a terrible experience at Blend Astoria. The staff are inexperienced and the manager on duty was just as terrible. We arrived at 3:50pm on a Sunday and was told by the hostess that the Kitchen will not open until 4:15pm for the dinner menu. (Okay, no problem) Without being asked if we preferred indoor or outdoor seating on a chilly evening, we were sat outside right by the hostess station. (Okay, whatever, we'll deal.) We waited until 4:20pm and the table next to us who came way after us got their order already taken (Okay, whatever, we'll deal). We were being completely ignored until we asked a passing waitress if she would kindly take our order. She wrote down our order and we thought all was fine. Until about an hour later.... where the heck was our food? We followed up with the waitress and then was told by the unapologetic manager that our order did not make it to the kitchen and the appetizer would be on them. (REALLY?) We walked out. NO, THANKS. NEVER AGAIN. Do better, Blend Astoria.
I'm not going to complain about the wait at times because when something is good everyone wants it! I love the fried shrimp and mac & cheese they are my favorites for lunch/dinner. For breakfast I love the French toast and peach dressing served with it. It's absolutely amazing. It reminds me of my grandmother's peach cobbler. The place has a very cute ambiance, not too small definitely not big but always a great vibe.
Serive has improved than the last time when I was there. We waited for a while for our entrées... still. It is exciting to see a stylish Chinese resturant open in Tribeca .  Beautiful interior design.
Came here for dinner on a Thursday night and I was impressed! Beautiful, intimate space with very nice decor. Decor which you could also buy right around the corner at abc carpet & home! We sat at the intersection next to abc cocina and carpet & home and it was a little amusing seeing customers at the furniture shop glancing into the restaurant.  Great service and while the decor was classy, everyone was casual and friendly. Now on to the food: Crab toast with lemon aioli - This is a MUST order. Crab was chilled, sweet, and so fresh on top of a thick slice of soft bread. Very meaty and the lemon aioli worked perfectly. Great start to the meal.  Pretzel dusted calamari, spicy tomato and mustard aioli - Crunchy crust and tender calamari! Not sure I could tell that it was pretzel dust, but it was a great crust. The spicy tomato sauce was not that spicy (great for me!) and I loved it! The mustard aioli has quite a kick so be prepared.  Mushrooms, parmesan, oregano and farm egg pizza - Wasn't planning to order pizza at first but then saw other Yelper's photos and that changed our minds real quick. Whole pieces of different mushrooms perfectly cooked on top of the pizza. The egg was a bit overcooked so it wasn't runny as I would have liked, but maybe we should have ate the egg sooner! The crust was thin and had a great crunch, but a little burnt around the edges. Note - be careful, there was pepper flakes pre-sprinkled on top and I unfortunately had a bite of flakes.  Wood oven roasted Maine lobster, oregano and lemon-chili vinaigrette - The star of the meal! Beautifully cooked lobster that they brought out split on two separate plates for us. The lemon-chili vinaigrette added great flavor to the lobster. The claw meat was take out already and the outside had a bite to it from the oven. We wished there was more tail meat, but overall great lobster!  Mashed potatoes with sea salt - Buttery, whipped mashed potatoes that was a shining side to the lobster!  Would be back for brunch and the CRAB TOAST again!
Would have been a lot better if they didn't get super mad about splitting the checks. Clearly one of us wasn't going to pay $200 for one table. Pretty disappointed in the way we were treated.
Sigh. Ok, I've been here more than a handful of times. First of all, now that Sam is gone, service mostly sucks. The new bartender is completely impersonal. The food-some items are delicious, some only okay. They took a lot of the good stuff off of the menu. The owner is the biggest issue of this place. He's not friendly and no matter how many times you go into Lexington Social, whether you're a regular or not, he will never give you a buy back. The dude is a taker, plain and simple. With new places opening up in the area, hopefully this will not be our only wine bar option.
Located in an alley surrounded by tons of barbershops, this place consistently has a line out the door.  I went to this location for the first time (there's one on 56th and another in Flushing, too!) with a few of my friends visiting on a Friday night around 10:30PM.  My group of 5 was seated in about 15 minutes.  The place uses its space very efficiently, and the servers definitely work to get as many customers in and out the door as they can.  We shared a large round table in the back with another group of 5.   The pork soup dumplings here are an ABSOLUTE STEAL.  You get 8 gigantic dumplings for $6.95.  And they are, without a doubt, the best I've ever had.  No other soup dumplings, whether from a dim sum place or a Din Tai Fung (which is exclusively on the West Coast in the US) compares.  The dumplings are loaded with this piping hot, delicious broth.  We ended up getting 4 orders of these.  I'm also a huge fan of their Young Chow (Yangzhou) fried rice, and we also got a fried noodle dish with mixed vegetables (forgot what it was called).  Needless to say, we were absolutely stuffed. Even with how packed it was when we went, the service was still great.  We got our food a lot faster than we expected.  After we were done eating, they gave us orange slices as well. I would say going to either location is fine, but I personally liked this one more.  It just depends on what you prefer -- the one on 56th is a lot nicer and is much more spacious, but I believe the prices are also higher.  For me, I'm going primarily for the food, and 8 of these amazing soup dumplings for a paltry $6.95 is something I can't refuse.
Pork jowl, pork belly adobo, and San noodles!  Pork jowl with crispy, caramelized Brussels sprouts were tasty and the dish was vinegary.  My favorite dish was the pork adobo which was insanely good! The pork belly was cooked perfectly - the skin was so crispy and chewy at the same time. The sauce it came in was a perfect complement to the coconut rice.  My least favorite dish was the SAN noodles which were too vinegary for my taste but maybe that's how it is - authenticity wise.  For dessert, my three other friends and I shared the donuts and the shaved halo-halo ice dish! The donuts were soft, fresh, and hot! They were accompanied by a lemon ricotta icing.  My favorite part about the halo halo were the crispy rice kernels and the ice cream. There were also pieces of caramelized plantain chunks which were abundant.  Their drinks are also very unique and delicious - my friends got the spicy margarita inspired drink, Lower East Side, I think. And if you love horchata, I would recommend getting the Mr. Horchata. Drinks are strong and delicious. Nice compliment to the more savory dishes that they have to offer.
Pretty nice place clean and immediately someone took my order when I walked in. Frozen margaritas are $9. I got 2 chicken tacos they were okay when you added hot sauce. I asked for sour cream and apparently it's a $1 extra. I thought that was quite ridiculous. What's a taco without sour cream? The corn was the best part.
We visited Da Claudio for a team event. We had about 15 people. The ambience was very nice and the service was extra ordinary.  The staff did a great job attending to all of us. We ordered several appetizers all of them were very good. For the main course I had the pasta with bolognese  sauce and it was excellent. I will definitely be visiting again with a smaller group to sample the other options on their menu.
A coworker and I stopped in for dinner before seeing Waitress this week.  We quickly looked on Yelp and this restaurant had the best reviews, so we decided to check it out. Service was great, the atmosphere was lively and the food was absolutely delicious - I enjoyed every bite of it!  We told our server we were seeing a show and he made sure our entrees came out quickly.  My coworker enjoyed the fish special and I enjoyed the veal martini with white vermouth and artichokes...so tasty!
This place sucks service sucks management sucks  Sorry but as you can tell we had a bad experience
Can't believe it took me so long to visit this place - I've passed it a million times. Unfortunately the day I came it was too rainy to eat outside, but my party of three did get a table for brunch right away. I had the French toast with an iced coffee, and tried the huevos rancheros and basque scramble. My French toast was amazing - definitely adding to my list of the best in the city. The iced latte looked super fancy in its tall glass and was pretty decent. The other dishes were also excellent! Highly recommended.  Grab a matchbook on your way out - the matches have bright pink tips! So cute.
The food is okay, the space is cool, the beers are plenty, but the service is pretty terrible. They have messed up our order (brought us the wrong food) multiple times and messed up our check (charged us for things we didn't order) multiple times, because it seems like they just aren't paying attention, but at least they're pretty... I think they're authentically Irish...
Drinks were ok. Food came out cold. Burger wasn't anything to rave about. Pretty disappointed.
Overpriced. The bathroom was disgusting beyond belief.... Too many tables so the place was elbow to elbow unnecessarily.   And none of the servers understood English well enough for me to get details of oysters or dishes. Won't ever go back.
Really enjoyed my time here last night. I came here with some friends and food was delicious! Mac and Cheese, Green Shrimp Pasta, Mash and Lamb Chops all tasted amazing. Plates were very nicely prepared and presented. Great selection of beers as well as a good amount of cocktails. Made reservation, We were late but still seated promptly, Bar tenders were very nice and very attentive. At the table our waiter delivered exact same service, By the way Hostess was amazing, Hard working girl, running around seating guest and helping table get prepared for next parties. I was very impressed.
Unbelievable. So good. We had 4 small plates and 2 sides, pork belly, steak, ground chicken, pad cakes, jasmine rice, and rolls. Donuts for dessert. Total flavor explosion. Luckily I went early, as I saw it get super crowded as we left. Amazing food!
The place is spectacular and comfy! The food is delicious, not pricy and service is nice! Have a backyard and bar just for the drinks!  Highly recommended and 100% will come back again.
The food was inviting .. Some pros some cons... The service however was the worst I've ever had. About 30-40 inbetween courses. Very little attention given to the quality of our dining experience.
"Oh man, this place is so overrated. I got it - prime location, fun vibe, drunk manager creeping on costumers around the restaurant with his ""coffee cup"" .  Every time I have a pizza here ITS BURNT, no joke. Their staple is the one thing they can't get right. I feel like a dog eating burnt pieces of dough. I have to admit I got free glass of red wine when I complained but only once . I feel like I deserve the whole bottle by now. Get better and stop loosing your loyal costumers !!!!"
It was the first time to try this restaurant. Becasue of the hight score review. But it turn out that it made us very disappointed. We ordered the steak and burger with medium well. Both were over cook and tasted bad!!!
Is this a theme park or a restaurant?  After sampling it a few times it's more likely the former stuffed with a state of the art stereo system. It's as if the owners are hoping you'd be too occupied staring at statues of Buddha rather than paying attention to the food. Because as soon as you get over the music and the lights you realize the food is Asian-inspired bar grub masquerading as haute cuisine. It's fun to go with a group of people and forget all that but if you like good food - this isn't it.
Went to Pig & Khao for brunch, and what a great experience! The ambiance is very modern and minimalist, yet you'll find subtle hints that remind you that you're getting Asian fusion. The 90's hip hop was also music to my ears. So here's a recap of what my wife and I ordered: - Sisig: came out on a sizzling plate, with a cracked egg that cooked as it was brought over to our table. The Sisig was had a nice crunch to it, and stayed true to its Filipino roots. - Corn Beef Hash: from it's title sounds very comforting - which is was. Like the Sisig, it came out on a sizzling plate with an egg. However, what truly set it apart from regular corn beef hash was the inclusion of lime, cilantro, and chili peppers. It brought about an exotic flavor profile, yet you still feel like you were eating corn beef. - Garlic Fried Rice: Generous serving size, just the right amount or stickiness, and ample amounts of fried garlic. - Hot Tea w/Whiskey: Great value at $7, $3 for the tea plus $4 to add whiskey. Fun drink that warms you for a couple of reasons, and a pleasant alternative to mimosas for the brunch crowd.
"Salinas was one of my favorite places until I booked a group dinner in September. They were very professional and we had to sign an agreement. Fine. But as you may have expected, things went sideways and only 5 people could make the date. Now I understand you have your restaurant rules but to make us not only pay for 9 people's portions, and then TO SERVE those  9 portions to 5 women at a table was downright embarrassing. Of course I asked the manager if they could maybe charge us for one less person but the answer was a solid NO. Zero willingness to work with us. We were told that the kitchen has to buy ""all this extra food"" for large groups. Well, doesn't every other restaurant in NYC? It's not like you have to buy extra equipment... otherwise, you wouldn't be running a restaurant. When you can book groups at other restaurants on Opentable easily, I would avoid locking yourself in with a group booking at Salinas. Zero understanding of basic customer service. Because of that lack of flexibility, we will never return."
"I'm a little picky when it comes to Peruvian chicken/cuisine because 1.) I love it and 2.) my family and I have dined at various Pio Pio locations and they are the standard by which other Peruvian joints are measured. Our party of 8 dined here last Saturday evening. We arrived a few minutes early and were promptly seated. It was 6pm and before the dinner rush arrived but the place filled up a short while later. It's intimate inside which isn't a huge surprise for a place in the heart of Manhattan so definitely make reservations if you're going in anytime close to prime times. Our server was friendly, patient, and helpful. When I ordered a Chicha Morada for my beverage, she asked if I had ever tried it before. I said ""no"" so she suggested I try a sample 1st, before ordering it. I appreciated that because I guess perhaps it's not for everyone. I enjoyed it though, although I would have preferred it over ice or more chilled. My family of 3 shared a Combo Chalaco which consisted of a whole chicken, avocado salad, french fries, rice and beans. The chicken was well cooked although it could have used a little more flavor. The fries were fine and the rice/beans were similarly decent. The avocado salad was pretty good...as far as avocado salads go anyway. The biggest disappointment was their spicy green sauce, which we found to be lacking the ""wow"" factor and was a notch or two below the spicy green sauce we've had at Pio Pio and other Peruvian restaurants. I saw a lot of folks ordering up various seafood and it looked rather yummy so I would like veer toward that if we come back here. Pricing is fair and on par with their competitors' pricing. Location is close to MSG so worth a try if you're in the area and hungry."
I made a reservation via OpenTable and it was really easy. They had a lot of availability for dinner. We ordered the pad kee mao and the duck curry. The pad kee mao was a bit on the spicy side but quite good. I really like pad kee mao and its brother pad see yieu so you can't go wrong on these noodle dishes. My duck curry was more like a soup given the consistency of the curry (it was a little bit on the watery side) but the flavors were so rich. I love coconut milk based curry so this hit the spot. They had chunks of pineapple and lychee in the curry and it definitely gave it a sweet taste. The duck leg was a tiny bit dry but I really liked the skin. I wasn't a huge fan of the rice though since it tasted a bit too dried out.  The lighting is actually really bright in this restaurant. You can actually see your companions! How nice.
Momosan  I was excited to try this ramen restaurant because I've been watching Chef Morimoto on Iron Chef since ages ago. I thought we should check this place out during lunch time due to the line during dinner. As expected no wait at all on a Saturday.  Water was given upon seated. Service was quick. We ordered the lunch set:  Appetizer: shared a Kakuni bao: your basic pork cha shu bun. Tasted alright.  Tonkotsu Ramen:  soup: can taste a lot of msg even hours afterwards, not as rich as others I've tried. The pork was meaty not enough fat. Egg was cooked to perfection. Noodle itself was chewy.  ChaShu Don: The rice and pork pairing here goes well together.  All this for the price of $16 is definitely worth the lunch. In addition, its $3 per bun if you order with the lunch set.  Question, playing Korean pop music in a Japanese ramen restaurant ? Mmmmm?
This is a nice Italian restaurant in the Village, close to West Houston. It's conveniently located near the Angelica theater. The ambiance is warm and welcoming, the pasta very tasty, the wine of good quality, and the service friendly, if a tad slow. If you have no reservations, you might be seated at the communal table. I did not particularly like the communal table, but that is a reflection of personal preference or mood. Sometimes one prefers some privacy, and other times having strangers at your table can be fun.
Took two trips to make it here, but well worth it. The first time, despite that we went there probably around 5:45(!), this place was PACKED. There was absolutely NO room to navigate, let alone get drinks. So we had to concede defeat.  This time, we managed to show up even earlier (thank god this place is near the office) and while it was pretty full, we managed to snag 2 of the remaining (and quickly disappearing) seats at the bar.  Barn Joo boasts an awesome happy hour menu from 4-7pm - $1 oysters and $7 for drinks and appetizers. We ordered a customary dozen and they were fresh and tasty. If you sit at the small bar near the entrance you can watch them being shucked. Also got a plate of Korean fried chicken, which was spicy! Cocktails are well-made, I enjoyed the Lavender Honey.    The crowds can be off-putting, so I'm glad I was prepared to squeeze a little. However, I was not feeling these two super-basic girls who were practically standing on top of us while we were finishing. Seriously, back off, chair thieves! Wait your turn like everyone else.
MSG! MSG! MSG!   I just had the watercress and tofu soup and had a severe MSG reaction to it.  If you are allergic to MSG, do NOT eat here.  You will definitely get sick.
"This place SUX big time!!  So we enter a basically empty INATTESO on a Saturday night (and you may wonder why) with a party of 4...  Seated and with menus on a Saturday night about 10pm. Here we are, gracious and easy going, ordered, drinking then eating and suddenly being RUSHED the PHUCK OUT! ""No rush"", the lovely waitress said, but not even a minute later the PROUD ITALIAN waiter (who by the way, studied Spanish in Spain, as he proudly mentioned, because he was not understanding ""our"" Spanish... pointed out) dropped the check.  I won't deny that they DID say kitchen was closing, however... having been a LONG time restaurant goer, they could've brought over a dessert menu to close things out in a professional manner. Forget it!! Our waitress was putting on her coat as we were trying to negotiate a dessert that never happened... This is NOT a restaurant for the financial area in its true sense; this is just a supplier of so-so Italian food for the area in the hours it wishes to ""entertain"".  Food: C- Service: Pleasant but in the end an F for FAILURE Decor: B+ Prices: MEH... for what it is... Shameful.  Proud Italian hospitality, rushing patrons out with a smile at 11:15pm on a Saturday night in NYC.  Hilarious!! Never EVER again.  To management - that is 4 people who live IN THE AREA - who will definitely tell at least 2 people each; and so on and so on and so on... Awful and shame on your staff."
I've been really unhappy by the fact that you guys are closed multiple times and do not notify your customers on your website or on Yelp. This is the second time I have attempted to go and find out it is closed. You can at least have a voice recording when customers call to notify them that you are closed for renovations. I had to call the business next door and ask them if they knew your restaurant was opened or closed.
Perhaps an off night, but was less than impressed. Wait staff was rushed, did not know the menu well, flubbed the drink order. The food was okay, but nothing special. 3 stars for the decor and ambiance, 2 stars for the food. I likely would not give it another try.
Huge disappointment, they served me old spoiled lettuce and avocado. The drinks took to long to come and the waiter was horrible.  Only plus,  the manager comped the check due to the issues.
Traditional Italian restaurant with large portion sizes! The restaurant is truly a gem in the surrounding area and neighborhood. It took us a while to find this place via the subway and bus. It was refreshing to arrive inside and be greeted right away, despite the hustle and bustle that went on inside (extremely busy and very crowded). We miraculously were seated within 5 minutes and checked-in for our complimentary wine (when you order an entree). The restaurant was loud, but I have no complaints, because the food and drinks were very good. There were plenty of family birthdays and celebrations going on around us. Everyone looked happy and very satisfied with the food. I loved the pasta and seafood dishes we ordered, along with the lemon sorbet and cappuccino! The portion sizes were large (especially for the pastas), so I brought mine home and the leftovers were just as delicious! We hope to come back again when we are in the area (maybe to visit the Bronx Zoo again when it's warmer and more animals are outside).
Stopped here to have breakfast before heading back home. The food was good. I had the pancakes with caramel sauce and pecans. My daughter had the BLT-E. Surprisingly the home fries were really good, too many times they lack seasoning in other restaurants. The whipped ricotta was very tasty. Would definitely recommend this place.
Where is the cream corn! Ugh it wasn't always on but, when it was on it was EVERYTHANG! So you have forced me to learn to make cream corn, I should give you another star but, I will withhold it praying that my corn returns. Update: you replace the corn with a loaded grit dish and MY MY I shall eat crow cause, y'all Put it ALL the WAY DOWN with the GRITS BOO YAS! That one star returns
Easy... Easy to dine with kids, Easy for happy hour to get a cool crowd, Easy to get great food, Easy to get good service, Easy to go to a clean bathroom.... It's a refreshing place for New York that's hip & cool but not a pain in the ass to deal with!!! One of our local spots!!!
Found this place by accident but it was a most pleasant surprise. The quality of food was ver good and tasty and the potions given was ample. The cost is a bit but worth the cost in flavor and the staff makes it a welcome. I will come again.
adorable brunch place BUT get there EARLY! even on a very cold winter day the bar area & sidewalk outside were flooded with people waiting for a table! we had no problem getting a table at 11:30 one thing i wish i knew before i ordered.. THE PORTIONS ARE GINORMOUS .. there must have been at least 7 eggs in my dish! THUS sharing the french toast as a dessert was gluttony at its finest ---basque scramble: the chorizo gives a great flavor to this, but damn that's a lot of eggs ---baked eggs: MMmm flavorful ---virgin frittata: the frittata was bland, the amount of eggs just overpowered any taste from the goat cheese, tomatoes, or the generous amount of pesto ---banana french toast: SUPER SWEET, i would not be able to eat this dish alone.. it's good but i wouldn't say it lived up to the hype. the crust seemed borderline burnt shed those pounds because you'll be squeezing your way through the tables if you are seated on the right side of the restaurant!
The interior is so cute and the ambiance is great, calm and relaxed with dim lighting. The food was very tasty but the portions were huge! I couldn't finish my fried catfish po' boy and neither could my boyfriend. That's not really a problem! The staff was very nice and attentive! Love it!
Traif has always kind of sparked my interest, but I've never been fully invested in trying it because I hardly venture out to Brooklyn. My friend and I have been trying to change that by creating quota to go to Brooklyn at least once a month now that the weather is nicer.  The restaurant itself can be hard to miss if you're not actively looking for it - it looks like your standard small place with closed doors to prevent heavy winds. We were looking for it and since we were across the street, we actually almost missed it. However, Traif is a lot bigger than what I expected - they even have outdoor seating! Hearing of the long waits, we arrived at 6:30 (they open at 6) and surprisingly the restaurant was pretty much empty. They even seated us outside on a table meant for 4. I highly recommend you ask to sit out here, especially for those nice summer nights.  After receiving menus, our waitress immediately informed us that for 2 people, it's recommended to order 5-7 dishes (5-7 dishes for 2 people is an over exaggeration of the amount of food you need for 2. 4 is plenty). We took the recommendation into mind, but were only really interested in 4 things, so we went ordered the tuna tartar, the short rib sliders with sweet potato fries, the strawberry cinnamon glazed ribs, the broccoli rabe with mushrooms and egg on truffle toast, and the bacon doughnuts with coffee ice cream. Ironically and unintentionally, that was the order of my favorite dishes.  - The tuna tartar resembled poke with an abundant amount of spicy mayo combined with eel sauce, served on top of tempura eggplant. SO good that my friend and I shamelessly tried to wipe the plant clean of the eel and spicy mayo combo with our eggplant. The eggplant surprisingly was not greasy at all either.  - The short rib sliders were so flavorful and juicy for its size that the juice dripped down both my friend and my face. The sweet potato fries were okay in my opinion, your standard sweet potato fries. However, they were a bit too salty. I liked the paprika dripping sauce though.  - Meat so tender that it just falls off the bone. However, the ribs were grilled a bit too long that some of the ends were too charred and hard for my liking. The sauce was unique, where the strawberry really came through - kind of like strawberry jam, but it was too overpowering that you didn't taste the cinnamon at all. Generous portion of 4 large ribs.  - Surprisingly, the broccoli rabe was served last. You would think it'd be the first dish out of the kitchen because vegetables don't take long to cook at all. It took so long that we actually thought they forgot we ordered it. When it finally arrived, it literally smelled and looked like heavy cheese, overwhelming you. For $15, you literally just get a plate of broccoli rabe with a slice of soggy bread (not the toast that was advertised), few pieces of mushroom, a fried egg, and a bed of parmesan cheese on top of the egg. It wasn't a bad dish, but it wasn't wow either, so I would skip this and order something else.   - We were already stuffed, but my friend said the bacon doughnuts was THE dish to get at Traif, so our second stomachs kicked it, overruling our minds. As we saw this dish bought out to the other tables, we were super excited as it looked heavenly. However, one bite in and we were so disappointed. The doughnuts were so dense and not light and airy. The bacon accompanying them were so overly fried that it was unenjoyable. I know, you're probably thinking how could bacon be bad? When it cuts the top of your mouth. The saving grace of this dish was the coffee ice cream - you can tell it was house made.  Service overall was great. Our waters were never empty and the food came relatively quickly minus the broccoli rabe. It's not a fancy restaurant, but prior to your meal, they do bring you an amuse, which was pea soup the day we went. It was steaming hot, but really good - I would actually order a cup/bowl of it if it was on the menu. My friend thought the taste resembled the dry seasoning packet for the spicy packaged ramen. The only thing my friend and I didn't appreciate about the service was the semi dirty look and aggressiveness of our waiter when we only ordered 4 things opposed to her 5-7 recommendation. Good thing we didn't listen to her because we literally were so stuffed due to how heavy the food was - I definitely would just stick to ordering 2 dishes per person. Then after after we finished, she immediately just placed the dessert menu on our table without even asking if we wanted dessert. Her behavior reminded me of a commissioned sales person trying to meet her targets.  Overall, we're glad we made the journey out to Brooklyn and makes us want to venture out there more. I just wish Traif wasn't so pricy!
"Well the drinks are overpriced but they are really good being that the bartenders make them really fresh.the boat was smaller than we thought.upon going towards the back of the boat we were told you have to make reservations which was an hour and 45 minutes thats fine ,but then after he called us he sat us at the oyster bar why would i wait that long at the bar to be seated at another bar and not get a table .I told the host I wanted a table then he said thats another 45 minutes that left a bad taste in my mouth especially being that i seen someone that came after sit at a table.I think the view is lovely but the service sucks the bartenders are not friendly .One guy asked for a gin and tonic and the bartender rudely said ""we only make whats on the menu"" if the prices is high I prefer better service.I give two stars because the view is nice and picture worthy."
We often come here to this little casual restaurant to get delicious Chinese street food.  The price is very reasonable and there is plenty of seating even though it's quite popular with the locals.  I'd definitely recommend the crab and pork xiao long bao and you really can't go wrong with most of the rest of the menu either.
"I attended the Yelp elite event held here a couple weeks ago. This place was delicious. Everything I tried, I enjoyed. It's definitely a cozy spot, but like most places in NYC, they know how to maximize the space they have. Deviled eggs - YUM! I am so happy that these little scrumptious bites of an otherwise fairly plain food, has become a 'thing' for appetizers and finger foods. The chicken & ""cheddar"" waffles were a perfect combination -- juicy, crunchy fried chicken with a slight hint of cheese in soft waffles, topped with some whiskey syrup were awesome. Shrimp & grits - I am not a usual fan of shrimp & grits (and I'm from the South) - but Root & Bone pulled it off into something enjoyable. I don't think anyone would be disappointed if they checked this place out."
"Wow! - Were we disappointed!  This place was rated as the best moderate Italian restaurant near Rockefeller Center, so we thought we were in for a real treat. Instead, it was lacking in every possible way as follows: 1- The staff was not welcoming. 2- The bread service was awful:  2 tiny cold crusts with bad-tasting olive oil on the side. 3- Even though the place was not crowded, it took almost 30 minutes to get our two pizzas. 4- But was the pizza worth waiting  for?  Not at all!. Both pizzas were boring-tasting with crusts so bad that they could have been made by Kramer  during the Seinfeld episode of ""Make your own pizza."" 5- The clam pizza with bacon was actually potentially dangerous to eat. Unbelievably, the tiny clams with their shells were on the pizza and there were many sharp , broken fragments that were hard to see in this darkened restaurant. Luckily we discovered this early, and spent time picking the shards out! 6- The wild mushroom pizza was short on mushrooms and actually used bacon instead of proscuitto . 7- The place is loud with groups from out-of-town. Ugh!!"
What a solid place- love the cozy environment and friendly waiters are always a plus! The starter bread and oil were SOO good!  We got the shrimp fettuccine and it was creamy and delicious without being too overwhelming and the plate was beautiful :) The truffle mac and cheese tart WOWIE. I was so surprised how good it actually was... Winner!!
I have mixed feeling about my brunch at Bijan's. We arrived at 11 am, but the staff complained that they couldn't open up yet because of a late waitress. We came back 20 minutes later to get a seat. Unprepared management, unhappy staff. Not the best way to start your morning.  The space is charming in a cozy Brooklyn meets Bedouin kinda way. Its rustic, but industrial, and filled with lots of kitsch, succulent plants, and modern art pieces. There are small tables, as well as one long communal table. If the place is full, it would feel very crowded. Our tables and chairs were very wobbly, which drove the OCD in me a little crazy. The lack of uniformity and polish actually makes the place look a bit gritty.  I ordered the: Lemonade Saffron semolina pancakes Lamb burger Coffee (which the poor staff kept complaining was going to be a tiny bit of a wait because SOMEBODY didn't show up on time, and wasn't she so sorry that SOMEBODY was completely ruining her day) The pancakes sucked. They tasted like baking soda, not like saffron. They were remedied only by the blueberry compote on top. But if you can't serve a pancake that tastes good on its own, you shouldn't be serving it. However, Perry absolutely loved his lamb burger with feta. He polished it off faster than your momma can say your full name. So his happiness with his meal counters mine. I can see how this place would be awesome for cocktails and lounging around. But that's not why I was here. The service was whiny. The unprepared opening. The pancakes. So this gets a giant MEH from me.
I love Roberta's, my future sis in law lives across the street overlooking R's and if I lived there, I would be there every day. Love the vibe, beer, decor, and especially the pizza... sauce is delicious, cheese salty and stringy, bread crisp and chewy.
Much better places in New York. The quality definitely went downhill over the years. Service was crappy and definitely living off their former glory like the French Laundry. I am sad and won't be coming back. Not the restaurant my dad took me to on special days growing up.
$9 for a PBR/glass of house red or white wine + 6 blue point oysters or clams....nuff said. It's the best deal here. Service however is subpar. I forgot her name but our server weirded me out from the get go. We got our bill and it was $52 and change and because I had a bad feeling about the server I was ready to check my mobile banking to make sure everything was alright. Before I could even open my phone she came back with my card charged to a completely different bill...a $90 bill. So I tell her of the mistake and she basically accused me of making it up..until I showed her. Then she freaked out! My online banking showed two charges, one for $33 and change and the other for $90?!? Neither of these charges reflected my actual bill.. Called manager and got it resolved eventually but it was just a hassle. She gave us a couple beers on the house but I probably wouldn't go back.
40 mins wait on Saturday at 12:10pm for a table for 4.  Different parts of the steak tasted different - some are chewy from the connective tissues, some are tender and flavorful, some taste rare and beefy. Overall, still a good steak but I felt Wolfgang does it better. The bacon was a little dry. Creamed spinach makes a good balance to the oily meal as it was not heavy. The German fried potatoes are bland. Knowing from experience that we've never been able to finish the steak if we got a portion each, we got the steak for 2 ($103) to share for 4. However, found out that we got charged an extra $10 for sharing. I didn't think it was nice of them to charge people for not wasting food. I think I would order an extra $13 lunch burger than giving them the $5/$10 sharing charge. They have a free parking lot down the block from the restaurant
"Atmosphere is warm and potentially pleasant.  We were there tonight, enjoying beautiful, delightful unusually mild weather.  The restaurant's large front windows open creating a semi-al fresco experience.  A nice relaxed local feel to this cozy place set the stage for a delightful dining experience.  We ordered a pasta dish and a main course and our food came promptly.  However, all of this good feeling was trashed as we were simply forgotten about and ignored once the main course was over.   I understand that it's a relaxed local place and one lingers over one's food and no one is in a rush ... however, after quite some time had passed, and we were keen for dessert, we sat around while our waiters studiously looked in all directions except ours as if we didn't exist, schmoozed with other customers and just disappeared in general.  Finally getting our waiter's attention we requested a dessert menu.  Another seemingly interminable interval transpired as we waited for the menu to arrive.  They must have felt that the we might be daunted by the five or so choices on the dessert menu since eons transpired without any one coming back to take our order.  Finally, my boyfriend had enough with this shtick, and spoke to the manager -- who apologized, took our order and put it on the house.  I saw the manager speak with the waiter and our dessert soon arrived.  The server was cold and aloof, apparently feeling there was no reason to acknowledge -- in any way, shape or form -- that we had complained about his inexplicable lapse in service.  Apparently, he wasn't interested in a generous tip ... and he didn't get one. OK, so you'd think now, after dessert, having already complained once, that at least our check would come promptly, especially since we asked for it.  But nooooooooooooooo.   Again, the averted eyes, the ""we don't really see you or believe you exist"" attitude persisted.  And another very long wait ensued.  Finally, the check came, and we paid.  My boyfriend complained once again to the manager who we passed on our way out, and once again he gave us a pro forma apology. The food: we had the Tagliatelle Bolognese and the Grilled Sliced Chicken Breast with garden salad and shared the above-mentioned Apple tort with vanilla ice cream for dessert.  Tagliatelle was delicious.  The grilled chicken was an uninspired, bland affair with a few greens , some sorry ass iceberg lettuce, part of cucumber and half a tomato being the salad part.  The tort dough was tough or stale to chew and it came with a minuscule scoop of ice cream. Bottom line: nice atmosphere, horrific service, good pasta, mediocre chicken dish, sad dessert.   I don't like attitude from waiters, especially when people are being nice and not causing any trouble as we were.   We just wanted a pleasant dining experience and were treated poorly."
I heard good things decided to go for dinner on a Saturday night but when I walked in....no one greeted me. It's a small place and they weren't overwhelmed. I sat at a table and waited 10 mins for a menu. The waitress didn't offer water or a drink. She left for 15 mins to get liquor and her colleague didn't acknowledge me either. I waited another 20 minutes before I walked out.  As I'm leaving the original waitress was out side joking with friends out front...a bird in the hand is worth two in a bush.
I was able to get a reservation on a Friday night. My friend and I sat upstair. The upstair seating area seems to be more comfortable. Portion size was huge. We ordered the hot appetizer sampler and the special of the day seafood linguine. The hot appetizer sampler was delicious. This is a family style Italian restaurant so two people definitely cannot finish two dishes. We had a lot of leftovers. Waitresses were so friendly and constantly offered to help us wrap our meals. We also ordered a tiramisu. I didn't like the tiramisu because it was too sweet and had too much cream. Overall, it was really good.
His is my favorite spot it's spacious and the lobsters are so delicious and affordable . The only con I have is that it's walk -in only you can't reserve a table anymore . So when it get crowded just know you'll will be waiting 30-1hr but it's worth it !
Starved after the Brooklyn Half Marathon this place was our post race destination!!! Talk about ridiculously good! The brunch was to die for. It was an indulgence I waited weeks to have! My bestie loved her Bloody Mary (not my thing) and the Hawaiian Coffee was yummy and strong! Bring on the food! Chicken and waffles and shoestring sweet and regular fries.... Salty and delicious!!! Our waitress Alexandra was super friendly and attentive offering us some beer suggestions! I almost wanted to tell people walking by who were checking it out to come in and try it out! Definitely a return visit is in the future
Passed by this place quite a few times during my lunch break but it's usually full since they don't have too much seating. Finally got to try the ramen out and it was pretty good for fidi. The portion isn't too bad either. I wouldn't come here though if It wasn't a workday. There's better ramen places.
I love coming here for brunches. Cocktails are awesome. Good place for friends' get-together or a date.  Service is kind of slow though
Came here on a Friday night at 6:30 and the wait was about 30 minutes. It quickly flew by as my friend and I sat on one of their benches outside and chatted away. Inside they have an okay amount of seating. There's a round table in the front, bar seating and tables in the back. We both got the highly reviewed ratchaburi crab and pork dry noodles. They gave us a bunch of sauces and my friend and I might have gone overboard with that. I'm not sure if there was any taste in the noodles before but it was good after we added stuff. Beer is super cheap here, only $4.50/$5 a bottle - can't say no to that. I'd come back to try other things!
It's definitely a 3.5 in my book because it has a really fun atmosphere it you come here with a group of friends (which is exactly how I spent my Saturday evening here), but I have to round down on this one due to the food. There was a bit of a wait when we walked in, so the hostess took our name and number and called us when our table was ready.  The service is decent - waiters/waitresses are attentive and happy, but super busy, so not a lot of time for small talk.  A few colleagues of mine have been here and said they had great margaritas, so I opted for their spiciest one - the habanero margarita and asked the waitress to tell the bartender to make it as spicy as he wants to.  There was a definitely a kick, but it was really tasty! For appetizers, we got guac and the esquites (corn).  The guac was very underwhelming - no flavor, too many tomatoes, no lemon/spice flavor, nothing.  They also don't give you a lot.  The esquites were amazing - but then again, who doesn't love mexican street corn?! The four of us decided to split three entrees: Veggie tacos (mushrooms/cactus) - these were pretty good - the veggies were grilled just right, had a smoky flavor to them, wasn't soggy, and the taco didn't die/fall apart on you when you ate it. Enchiladas Rojas - I love these enchiladas at Mexican restaurants, but these didn't do it for me.  The sauce was fairly bland, and the enchilada itself didn't have a lot going on.  It was stuffed with some black beans and I believe a few veggies, with a couple slides of avocado and red onion on top - very weak.  They could do a lot more to spruce up the look, taste, quality, and quantity of the food in this dish. Chili Relleno (vegetarian) - this was a pretty tasty dish...I usually don't order this at Mexican restaurants, but this large green pepper was stuffed to the brim with different veggies and they all blended very well with each other. Definitely worth going to again, but would love to see what else is around the next time I'm in the area.  As a head's up, some of the larger tables are group seating.
Very unwelcoming.... First off, I tend to give all restaurants the benefit of doubt as I used to be a server/bartender and have been involved the F&B business operations.  We had bad night here. Whether this is a one-off experience or not it's worth noting. I will say, the food here is just ok.....However the service is the worst I've ever experienced. Before we even walked in the door the manager, Jonathan, came outside and said in a half joking tone they were closed. The sarcasm was confusing. We sat at the bar. Jonathan continued to push a number of unwanted drink options on my female friend- Belini? Cosmo? Lemon drop?...Really? it was straight up sexist. Then he continued to  push the specials of the evening multiple times  and scoffed repeatedly when we opted out. Again, right at the start it was weird...it only got worse through the evening to the point where we questioned whether we should even eat the food and/or tip!! Crazy bad, never again....
Be careful with what you read on about their drink specials because it's not in effect anymore, and yet is everywhere in their location.  Before I went in they had a board outside saying mondays they had $5 sangrias all day, it said the same on the menu, and yet when I went to order it the waiter said it wasn't in effect anymore. If that's the case the first thing they should do is remove from the signs, specially from the chalk board outside because it just looks deceiving.  I did have some wine and the waiter did have a wonderful and strong wine suggestion. I did enjoy my wine. The food was very good and tasty, but I find that the portions were really small. I mean, I know it's tapas, but come on! I've been to spain and 2 euros tapas were twice the amount of food I had. I will give it to them, the food was very tasty and delicious, but for the amount it's overly price.  If you want to go and spend a lot of money in very small plates of food, which is actually really good then this is the place for you. For me I know I can find both quality and quantity in other places in the city.
The place is very charming, rustic and romantic and the bathroom is very cute. But I have to agree with some other Yelpers that the food was overwhelmingly salty. We ordered the churrasco and the filet sandwich. Everything was just loaded with salt, even the side salad that came with steak. I scooped up a big forkful or lettuce and it down on a chunk of salt! Yuck. Sadly I really had hopes it would be better and even though everyone was friendly, I won't be back.
"Maybe it was an off night, because the reviews here are good & I am generally easy to please. Perhaps it was kind of awkward for me to order fetucchini & a place known for mac & cheese. Whatever it was, I just wasn't impressed (and it's not so hard to impress me). I won't be back.  We'll start with the food. The Mac & Cheese was AMAZING. If I was writing the reviews solely on this, it would be four stars. Still, it is kind of pricey and I'm sure I can get mac & cheese just as good elsewhere. The fetucchini was super salty and because of this tough to even finish. Maybe someone in the kitchen had a hand cramp that night, or forgot they had already salted our dish? Who knows. Unfortunately, this just wasn't a good dish and would be a ""miss."" I would not recommend it.  The worst part of this restaurant is the atmosphere and cleanliness. The bathrooms were dirty. My mom always told me growing up you can judge the cleanliness of the kitchen by the cleanliness of the bathrooms in a restaurant and I can't get that out of my head. I would recommend the restaurant stay on top of this. Towels and soap should be stocked so patrons, and more importably waiters and kitchen staff can wash their hands. The restaurant itself was super loud. I wanted to have a nice night with my husband, but we were crammed at a long table between multiple twenty-somethings with all of us yelling at our partners just to hear one another. It was terrible. I would recommend the restaurant installing rugs, or some sort of acoustic sound absorbing devices to help with this problem.  I do love the concept of the restaurant, with a few small tweaks I think it could be a really great place."
Went there around 6pm and the wait was about 15 mins for two. Which isn't bad considering that the juicy buns there are amazing! They're made fresh and you can definitely taste it. Best juicy buns in flushing.! If you want juicy buns this is the place to go! Just make sure you bring cash. Cards are not accepted.
can't expect much from touristy restaurants in little italy but the food here, once it finally arrived, was as expected.  have a couple of beers or glasses of wine and enjoy the people watching - it'll make the wait bearable.  service sucks but given the touristy clientele one empathizes with the service folks as they have to deal with all kinds, i kept telling myself.   if you have to do a restaurant in little italy, this is as good as the next.
"Perhaps I had too much expectation, perhaps I came in during peak dinner time. I was arriving at the Penn station that evening by Amtrak from north, and I know train tends to be late in the afternoon, I didn't want to make reservations for dinner until I know what time I may be able to arrive. I called this restaurant from the train to make reservation and walked from Penm station (I realized I should have taken a subway later). When we arrived, they were really busy, people without reservation were waiting.  Service was slow, particularly our server. She honestly had difficult time keeping track. She came back twice after she took our order, asking if we decided what we wanted. When she saw my face, she realized she already took our order.  Pasta was good, good texture and flavor but not the best. Chicken and shrimp from main dish had good lemony flavor but lacking some buttery taste. Chicken was so dry, after two bites I couldn't eat anymore. My colleague from overseas ate most of it as he was trying to be polite.  She never came back to see if we liked our food until we asked for a check.  I mentioned chicken was dry, all she said was ""but you ate most of it"". After that, I just paid and left.  I think this place do well for its location. So close to Broadway and Times Square, constantly getting more tourists from all over the world, they could care less for one disappointing customer."
A great spot for brunch- they don't take reservations so plan for a wait before being seated. That says, the food was worth the hour long wait- the pecan pie French toast was to die fir and so was the bean stew!
Perhaps I went on a bad day, but I really didn't think this place was anything special. I was quite disappointed after hearing all the great reviews about this place.  We ordered the classic burger (+$1) for caramelized onions, breakroom fries, taco platter with carne asada, pork belly and fish, and a passion fruit lemonade.  The burger was dry and not at all flavorful. The bun was over-toasted to the point where it was hard and the caramelized onions were not caramelized. Now I know a lot of burger places don't actually caramelize their onions to the point where it's soft and sweet but these onions were UNDER cooked. I should have saved my dollar.  The tacos were just alright. The beef was slightly dry and the pork belly was underwhelming. The fish taco was fried well and was probably the best of the three.  The break room fries was probably my favorite. It was unique with the fried egg and the mixture of fries and tater tots. This was the best part of our meal. The passionfruit lemonade was nothing special -- tasted exactly like the Tazo passion tea you can find at any supermarket. =[
The staff there all seemed to be Korean, but that's where the Korean-ness stops. Some might consider the dark interior chic, but it just didn't have the usual Korean restaurant 's atmosphere.  I went there a few times. Two of the three occasions, I found the food tasting slightly off. It must a fusion style of some sort cuz my tongue didn't quite recognize the taste. Mind you, I had ordered the same dish at different restaurants, many times before.  On my third try though, the sashimi over rice with spicy bean paste sauce was great. Either comparable to my past experiences or even slightly superior.   Bottomline. I wouldn't mind going back for the sashimi over rice. But I would be hesitant to try something new there.
"This week's heat spell, plus the party that was in my pants yesterday equals this joint's name. I. Hate. Summer.  Everything that is good about The Boil is because of two things: the different sauces and the shtick. The shtick is eating with your hands from plastic bags with the shell fish of your choice swimming in rich sauces that are either sweet or will light your hole like the 4th of July. Yes, I meant that one. They give you gloves and a bib(because you're a slob) that evoke childhood memories of chedda bay biscuits & mom trying to sneak as much of said biscuits out in her bag for later. Or, was that just my ghetto ass family?  Skip the Dungeoness crab & go for the King. Why? Because they're the same price here & the real market price is usually 30$ ish for King & 10-12$ for the other, per lb. Skip the oysters. Porque? Because, if a menu just has ""oysters"" without a choice or name, it's like ordering an appetizer with the description of ""meat"". That said, the garlic sauce is good on anything. Dump it on your rice or down your pants & it's a flavortown party.  A wise man once said: If I can make your food better then you and you're charging me 3x the price, then your space better be on the top of a mountain, overlooking the ocean, with aliens hovering overhead taking questions while I'm getting a lap dance from a Victoria Secret Model. Negative on all of the above, Houston. The design is pub like. The vibe is Hoboken meets Chinatown.  If ya like eating average shellfish drenched in sauce with a plastic drool guard around your neck, look no further. You've found The New...Red Lobster three point oh. Which, like chedda bay biscuits, has a special place in my heart."
Da Claudio is a hidden gem downtown, tucked away on Ann Street. The food is fresh, creative and delicious. I have hosted business dinners, private lunches and most recently brought my family of four after a tour of World Trade Center.  The service is attentive and the wine list is modest but a nice selection. We enjoyed great appetizers, main courses and desserts. My son has a nut and soy allergy and they were very accommodating to ensure his food was safely prepared.  The only negative is the noise level, as the acoustics seem to echo the busy conversations.
Fun place to enjoy some Italian classics along with innovative dishes.  Make reservations because seats can be tough.  Shared 2 apps and 2 pasta, which was a good amount of food for 2.  -squid, risotto sausage: delicious properly cooked squid.  It was tender.  Risotto sausage was creative and good, reminded me of the Korean blood sausage stuffed with rice.  -crab, avocado, apple with endives. Scoop the crab mixture on the endives, it was light and refreshing.  -Parmesan wheal pasta with basil and prosciutto.  The waiter toss the spaghetti in front on you in half a wheal of Parmesan.  It was light and cheesy!  -Uni pasta. Creamy but not overly heavy.  Uni flavor did was not too pronounced but yummy.  Texture of pastas were aldente. The pastas can be served appetizer portion as well.  The bread basket they give you with the olive oil was bomb! They also give you a piece of toasted baguette with creamy bleu cheese! Carbs!!!
I have been to Yaso Tangbao couple times because of work related meetings. It's one of the few Asian restaurants nearby, and I was happy to find it in the area. Pros:  1. The taste of the Baos are good.  2. Staffs are nice and bilingual(English and Mandarin) 3. Bathroom has a password, and it is clean. 4. There is a big window that you can see how your Baos are made. 5. Comparatively spacious with many seats. 6. You can find spots to charge your phones. 7. You can choose the sauces you want.  Cons:  1. The Baos I got has little stuffing. 2. It's a bit pricy.  3. The soup taste cheap and not that good.
I just want to start by saying that I really wanted to like this place. I've said it before, I'll say it again: there are no good Chinese restaurants on the Upper East Side.  That being said, I ordered delivery from here two days ago and everything was so mediocre.  Pork fried dumplings - probably the best of what we ordered but not cooked enough BBQ spare ribs - also undercooked. Literally pink. Also just bland Filet of steak w scallion, ginger, etc - Not bad but also not Chinese. Literally four pieces of steak in soy sauce Dinner was $48 for the three items listed above. Not worth it. Needs a lot of improvement, sorry not sorry.
Love their fish nd grits im a huge fan of gritz so I love it when I come to a spot that make it right. My friend had the fried chicken and waffles and that was so good. The chicken is so great like the perfect amount of crisp. ONLY thing is I wish their drinks were a bit stronger. I got a mimosa legit tasted like straight orange juice. They skimped on the drinks heavy if I wanted a virgin I would've ordered that to begin w. Other than that it was good
A little small... patrons are packed in like sardines...  too crowded and noisy for an early Sunday morning...  the brioche french toast was tasty.   Had to pick hair off the sausage,  the staff should be wearing hairnets.
I was expecting more given the other great reviews.  It had a classic Italian vibe with a darker and quieter interior. Service was a bit stuffy which is not my style. However, our waiter knew the menu and was attentive. I started off looking at the wine list and couldn't get over that they were charging about $70-75 for Santa Margherita Pinot Grigio when I can buy that for $18-22. While restaurants always mark up their wine, that seemed even more so and I was going to pass on wine on principle. Our waiter must have sensed our dilemma and recommended a reasonably priced Chianti that was also tasty.  The food was also just okay. A complimentary meat and cheese plate along with some zucchini chips and peppers was served. Nice idea but the zucchini chips and peppers were just bad. The zucchini chips were cold and soggy. The peppers were very hot/spicy (and we had no warning that they were hot).  The pasta was okay but not particularly memorable.  Overall, I thought it was an average experience that was overpriced. Too many other good options.
We went here for a birthday and it was an average night. The food was good and would've gotten a 4.5 rating but the portions were small.  Ambiance: 3.5 Food: 4 Service: 4 Overall: 4
"I chose to celebrate my graduation from graduate school by having a family dinner here. The food was to my satisfaction but our engagement with our waitress ruined the night. The waitress was not 100% attentive to our needs in a pleasant manner...she was utterly rude and lacked customer service skills. She blatantly ""complained"" about her interactions with our party, with her coworker ear shot from our table. When attempting to address this she became confrontational. All in all the manager was able to address our concerns, especially this situation."
I got the Hozon Ramen which was ehh. It came with crispy chickpeas, scallion, and kale. The noodles were thick. The broth was rich but I feel like they might've used a miso base in the Hozon ramen & I hate miso soup. Also, there was somewhat of a smoky flavor which might've been due to the crispy chickpeas. There was too much of another spice, I'm assuming garlic. I can't be sure because it was a sensory overload for me; too many strong flavors all at once. I feel like the ramen might've been better without the crispy chickpeas & if the flavors were a bit more balanced (less strong). I honestly didn't like the ramen. The service was great though!
After the high reviews on Yelp, I had to come here to check it out for myself.  They offered a variety of Asian cuisines from Thai, Malaysian, and Vietnamese!  PAD THAI with chicken - Much wetter than what I am used to, but that is not necessary a bad thing. The sauce was amazing, but quite spicy! It had a great unexpected kick~ PAD KEE MAO with chicken - Not as spicy as pad thai, a much milder spice! It was average, I had better at other Thai restaurants  PAD SEE EEW with beef - Average flavor, quite mild but the broccoli was not overly cooked, which was great  MEE GORENG with beef- This was probably my favorite dish, It reminded me of bolognese pasta. This was also quite spicy, but had great flavors throughout. Well cooked! Service was a bit messy (Friday night). We had to ask several times to place our orders. We also showed them our Yelp Check-In for a free Thai Iced Tea. It came in the smallest cup with a lot of ice. I finished it in one sip. Our dishes came at separate times. I felt they were more focused on the take out orders than with the current guests in the restaurant. Two dishes came out and then twenty minutes later two other dishes came out. Luckily, we were sharing the dishes, but if it was individual, two people would have finished their food before others got their food.  I have had better Thai, Malaysian, and Vietnamese food elsewhere without all the chaos and cramped space. I think the high ratings are related to its convenient location and average pricing, but the food was just average.
So this is my first time here at The Craft House.  Pros: Beer selection is quite vast and they give a little description of each beer they serve. Wings (buffalo) style were tasty with nice flavor. My waitress was attentive and very nice. Overall it's a nice looking place. Prices are very good. Cons: Had the bacon cheeseburger medium well came out medium rare, and the fries looked like they had been sitting in grease because they were no longer potato-ish. Waitress was cool about it and got another burger....which came out like sponge meat!!! Fries again not crispy not tasty. The chicken and waffles are nothing to brag about.  Waitress and beer selection give this place 3 Stars.
After walking around all day, we headed to Luke's after crossing the Brooklyn Bridge. It was a little hard to find, it's on the back end of a small hut-like building. There were a few signs out directing people where to go; now that you know that, you can keep an eye out for them. Tempted by much of the menu, we each ordered the Taste of Maine. The Taste comes with a half lobster roll, half crab roll, and half shrimp roll along with chips and a drink. All of the rolls are cold or mayo based, in other words, there's no option of a hot lobster roll. Of the rolls, the lobster was my favorite. It was a solid showing; I've had better, but it's still quite good. The half rolls are a bit on the small side. I'm not sure if this place is open year-round, but I would find dining challenging in colder months. There is only outdoor seating and a few tables between Luke's and the other shop sharing the building. On a nice day, you can take your meal over to the park only steps away.
I like this place. The food is generally on point, and the lunch selection and price is especially attractive and will not break the bank. I usually get the pho, and while not exactly like a true Vietnamese pho with all the gory parts of the cow, the soup base is decent. You'll pay an extra 50% more than its Chinatown counterpart, but I always remind myself that this place is in midtown and is supposed to be Asian 'fusion'. The other lunch selections are delicious and scaled accordingly for lunch, and I find that the end portions are just about right. I took away a star due to the dust on the wood walls and orange lantern lights. You would think that since it's unique decor, that they would have paid more attention to the cleanliness (or lack of). That's why it's so bizarre that it remains neglected. It would take at most an hour to clean, tops. I was always looking up hoping that the dust would not float down magically into my soup. That and I was wondering what Gordan Ramsey would say if he saw the dust, and perhaps, the kitchen.
Chandler was amazing! Literally saved my life! But honestly this was a really fun place. Food was good the vibe was so fun and I can't wait to come back and drink!!
"I was very excited to try this BBQ place after the reviews I've read about the place. I showed up early on a Saturday to beat in the crowd and dine on delicious BBQ.  Oh how disappointed I was with the food. I chose a duo of meats and sides to feast upon for my lunch, pulled pork and ribs with sides of Mac-n-cheese and baked beans.  The pulled pork was dry as if it was sitting under a heat lamp from the service the night before and lacked any flavor. The ribs were slightly better however after eating bland dry pork water would taste good.  Baked beans, a wonderful dish that is hard to mess up unless you're lazy...Well someone must have stayed out late the night before to neglect BEANS! Under cooked and the aromatics were just a slight hint that vanished faster than a fart in the wind. The Mac-n-cheese was better than the box with the dry powder cheese, I would rather eat the box the box mac comes in than suffer through that ""mac-n-cheese"" again. ** 2 stars"
This place has the best grilled corn I ever had, and that's saying something considering that I don't even like grilled corn that much! For 7 bucks, you get 2 grilled Mexican-style corns - really, really good, especially the cotija cheese!  I can't speak for the main entrees, however. I got a Cuban sandwich, and I have to say, I wasn't a big fan of it. I also got a glass of sangria here - not very impressed with it. It's a very casual joint, and seating is limited, so come here at a non-busy time or expect to wait quite a bit. The only reason I would recommend you visit is for their grilled corn!
It's very near subway track so ambiance is noisy, table are close together so expect your conversation be heard and you can hear tables around you clearly.  Seating is good up to party of 4. The chicken soup with chicken dumpling appetizer was good.  Curry puff I would skip. The noodle was too salty. The rice dish the rice is incredibly hard and dry, shrimp has funny taste and sauce too salty. I might give it a try due to it's nearby location and it's lunch menu starting $7.50
Overall, the chicken is great. I had the Hot Chicken and it was spicy!  Also the Fried green Tomatoes was amazing.   Just be aware that it's in a shaky area of Brooklyn and the service is lacking due to the LACK of employees.   Also the MAC & Cheese does not look similar to the yelp reviews.  Maybe it was an off day but mine was dry with burnt ends.   I will come back here again to try out more food options.
Spacious restaurant, good location. My friend and I went here for dinner on a Saturday night. We ordered dumplings to share and I ordered the sliced beef congee. The congee was good, not enough beef. I'm giving this place three (3) stars because 1. their server was rude 2. my friend and I wanted to split the bill and they didn't allow us to use two credit cards
Very cute restaurant, I really enjoyed my visit. I went with my sister and we split two crustinis, the salmon one and the avocado egg one. Both were delicious, the egg one a little spicy but good too. I would definitely go here again!:) quick and good.
Delicious! First off, plan to wait if you don't have reservations. I stopped in quick to see how busy they were before I parked and by the time I got back the line was nearly out the door.  We sat outside on a beautiful Sunday afternoon, Couldn't hear the music so much but that was fine. Started off with the Brooklyn Bellini ($14) which had me tipsy off of just one glass and I'm a drinker. The drink took about 20 mins to come out, our food came out 5 mins before that. My friend (who is by far the pickiest eater I know) and I got the chicken and red velvet waffle, it was to die for! I've had good chicken & waffle but this spot is definitely top 3. We also had the Aunt Cruz Mac & Cheese and I want to know what's it in because we both were full from eating and even after our food got cold we still dug in for a few more bites. It was really really amazing.  Daniel was our waiter and he couldn't have been sweeter. Very professional and attentive.  Definitely coming back
The food was  sub par but unfortunately both the stuffed shrimp and swordfish were really bland, the 'lemon potatoes' side didn't have an ounce of lemon flavor, also 3 wedgies do not equal lemon potatoes (if you commercialize multiple then at least deliver). The small salad is indeed small for almost $11  ... I realize it's not about quantity but in this place is not about quality ether, even the bread is stale.  Also it would be beneficial to have a lunch special at lunch time. We regret paying so much for food that lacked in flavor :( what a shame
Food was good. Could've used a little more seasoning, but I enjoyed it. The frozen drinks are yummy. And the space is nicely decorated. I love the loud colors. Staff was friendly and helpful with us as first time customers. I would love to return in the spring/summer season.
Overrated. NYC really needs to up its game when it comes to Thai food. This is yet another mediocre Thai restaurant in NYC serving watered down flavors and shying away from the rich, bold flavors that makes this cuisine great. I have to give them some credit for trying though. At least they asked us how spicy we like our food but despite us saying  'spicy!' the food was on the sweeter side. I give them an 'A' for Appearing to care. I had the red curry with pork, which as I mentioned before was too sweet. It needed a bit more sour and a lot more heat. My wife got the Krapaw Gai Sub (minced chicken over rice)  - and I swear I have had much better minced chicken over rice at a 7-11 in Bangkok. My cocktail was okay - I think it was their version of Old Fashioned or Sazerac - I can't remember exactly. My wife returned her cocktail 'cos she found it too sweet. I can see why people love this place though. It looks nice, cocktails are reasonably priced, service is friendly and most fresh-out-of-college kids living in the UES don't have a clue about good Thai food.
"Had the staff provided a very different response, this review would have not been written, and a customer probably would not have been lost. Unfortunately, the experience I had at this Chinatown joint just begs to be shared with the general public. Two nights ago, when I visited Tofu tofu for the second time, I discovered a baby cockroach casually floating in my banchan and alerted the staff of the vile intruder's presence. Predictably, their first response was to dump out the cockroach and replace the banchan from the same open and uncovered containers the contaminated food came from. I voiced my concerns that the entire batch of pickled vegetables had been soaking in cockroach juice and they should probably throw out the batch. Now one would think that it would be a logical assumption to double and triple check the source of the food and make sure that there are no more critters taking a bath in the pool of pickles but nooooo.... instead, the excuses of a really stretched imagination given to save a batch of pickles were somewhat entertaining.  Excuse no.1-  ""The little guy must have fell in after the pickles were put into the bowl. He is still dry!"" Response- ""Picks up the little guy... looks pretty wet to me"" Excuse no.2- ""The chemicals must have killed him and he fell into the bowl before the food was served!"" Response- ""I don't see any blind servers who can casually pick up a bowl with a diameter of 2.5 inches, ignore the cockroach in it, and proceed to put pickles into the bowl."" Excuse no.3- ""We are very clean!"" Response-""Little guy swimming here doesn't agree"" The gf and I then left with our hairs standing on our arms but upon hindsight, perhaps we should have given a chance to the server to cast a strong and confident vote in the food safety of the joint by eating the same food he refused to throw out."
When you arrive you can feel the excitement in the air at the Red Rooster in Harlem. It starts with bustling movement of the neighborhood and those dining outside. As for me and the other person dining we chose indoor dining. Where the energy of outside made its way into the main dining room and bar.  Once inside you will find a large room with a full bar and another with a large open concept dining room, you could clearly see into the kitchen. Once inside I gave my name as I had a reservation that we were 10 minutes early for. Looking at the size of the crowd and the host stating they will call us shortly it's clear they stick to the schedule. At the time of our reservation we were seated with menus. We were promptly offered water options bottled or tap. After asking a few Menu questions the server immediately informed us 3 entrees listed were not available. It was only 6pm?! My thought is, attach an amended menu. This may be better than saying 'sorry I have tell you we don't have this, this and that.'  We wanted to order the 'yardbird' meal for two but the macaroni and cheese is served on top of the collard greens. If you ask them to serve it separately you have to pay for them as separate side dishes. Hummm!! I don't mind my food touching but there are times when one item over powers the other and the taste is lost. I ordered the individual fried bird meal it has, collard greens and whipped yams. After receiving my order I understood why they suggest you pay for the sides separately. Its done to mask they give you small portions and if they were separate it you would see the minimal amount that you receive. I must say fried bird(chicken) is flavorful, crispy and moist. My dining partner found egg shells in cornbread, it was quickly replaced. I tasted the cornbread its ok but not special enough to pay $6 for two slices. During our dining experience a band arrived which stepped up the already lively environment. Food and live music, a good deal I'd say.  Overall the food is seasoned well without being salty. The decor is 'hipster nostalgic' with art and framed photos everywhere of the old and new. The service is good not exceptional however the Red Rooster in Harlem is a suggested stop!
Went here on a Sunday night to grab a quick bite to eat. It was not too crowded so only had to wait for about 5 minutes before ordering. I decided to try each of their taco options: Carne asada (4 stars): This one was pretty good, but just be aware that the raw onion and salsa pack some spice! Pollo asado (4 stars): This was about what I was expecting--decent flavor and moistness. Adobada (5 stars): This was my favorite of the offerings and was probably one of the best tacos I've ever had. Nopal (3.5 stars): This taco was decent in terms of flavor, but I felt that the cactus was not as tender as I was hoping. Overall, this place serves up some delicious food in a hurry. The tortillas are also super tasty and make for a delicious vehicle for the meat. That being said, the pricing of each taco at $3-$4 is pretty high considering the size, but it is well worth it, especially for the adobada.
7.Spice.Sour.. Always Been here too many times to count. It's been me and my fiancé's go to spot if we want to eat some umami comfort food. Dos: soft shell crab, pork buns, almost everything in their revolving menu. Also spent my bday dinner this past year here bo ssaming with friends, which I highly recommend. Had a private room in the back which the former Booker and Dax (r.i.p. to the momofuku 13th st triangle) was located.  Although the menu was pre fixed with the pork shoulder being the highlight for my table of 14, Ssam bar easily accommodated my one vegetarian friend with his own menu with no charge. A nice touch. Long story short. Love food? Come here with friends. And if the dessert menu is not to your liking, walk across the street to Milk Bar.
I had the chiken with foie gras in it and mu ramen. Ive heard a lot of this restaurant and i was very happy to finally go there. First, i loved the ambience of the store. Its was not too dark not too bright it was perfect light exposure to my eyes with energetic musics. Interior seems great with gray walls, tree made furnitures and the huge art piece looking light in the center of the store. It was very small. I finally got to sit on the bar and ordered. Service time was average. The appetizer, chicken with foie gras called something gyoza was the worst food i ever had in last 10 years. The foie grad was sooo pulpy like some jelly. Chicken seems under cooked but i didnt say anything because it seems they undercooked on purpose. Texture was the worst and shapeless.  When it comes to noodle, it finally prove why theres a long line to get in. The ox tail based soup was perfectly seasoned and aromatic and the pork inside the soup was the best way to have a pork. The cucumber and mushroom doubled the texture of the perfectly cooked chewy noodles.  I will go there again for a bowl of noodle buy definately not for the chicken.
Ok after all the hype about this place my boyfriend and I finally went to check out this spot at 1:00am in the morning..The milkshakes where priced at $15 which is a little bit over price for a toothache. I felt like I paid $15 for and Instagram/ Snapchat picture. My milkshake was watered down and not thick like how a milkshake should be. The pictures of the milkshakes looks better than how it actually tastes. However if your a do it for Instagram/Snapchat kinda person then I suggest that you go here for cool pictures.
"It pains me to write my first yelp review but here it goes Food is Meh! Terrible value for money. If you think Jacobs Pickle is a solid 6/10, then Maison Pickle will be equally as mediocre; the food is bland, heavy and overpriced. Solid wine and beer menu and desserts were excellent (the two stars) At the end of the day, if I wanted to spend $30 on a sandwich, I'd go to Benjamin's for their prime ribeye sandwich. The French dip here was very underwhelming, I honestly get more excited thinking chalupas at Taco Bell or buying family bucket of fried chicken at Popeyes after work. But Maison Pickle is Just terrible terrible value for money. I've never left a restaurant feeling like ""I got my face ripped off"" but i uttered those words immediately after leaving. If you're going for the French Dip, save your cheddar and buy a roast beef $5 foot long from subways and dip it in some instant gravy. If you're going because you love Jacobs Pickle, just go to Jacobs Pickle"
+++ Highlight of my meal was roasted butternut squash. I am a card carrying member and president of the anti-squash association, but I cannot deny the greatness of this dish (although the wife was unimpressed) ++ They close at 10:30, we were seated at 10:16 and got full service This is a great way to get the famed key lime pie from down the street (#twobirdswithonestone) Blood orange margarita is worth the price of admission, when else are you going to get that in life + Korean steak left a lot to be desired - Distance; Red Hook is so far out, even if you do have a car. The food here is good, but I don't think it's worth the trip, unless you're already in the neighborhood. TIPS: - EVERYBODY recommends the dumplings. I was just too full to try them. I do not regret me squash decision, but I simply didn't have space for another app. I guess I have to wait until I'm in the neighborhood again I do hate long soliloquies on Yelp reviews, but I must say I bee trying to go to Good Fork for a number of years. This was one of my absolute must-do/cannot wait to try,  but I didn't want to travel all the way out to red hook to do it. With that said, my expectations were extremely high, and this is a positive, well run, good food establishment. I think I was waiting for much more than I received, hence the low rating
Accommodating.  Mood lighting.  And delicious olive oil. Well those aren't the only things that stood out, but they certainly stood out.  They did not have place for my party of five  so they made a table (even though it was uneven) so we didn't have to wait. It is refreshing to have great service even in the middle of dinner service on a busy Saturday night. Dim lighting: great for date night, not so much for my grandparents.  Food: freaking delicious. Even my dad liked the cuttlefish with pesto sauce (I couldn't even get him to eat calamari before). And I found a new appreciation for olive oil. I don't know, it is just so good.
This restaurant was ok. It's in the heart of time square so expect a long wait and for it to be crowded. I highly recommend a reservation,  we had one for Sunday night and were seated within a few minutes which was great.  The staff is very friendly and do a great job of explaining how the menu works, however after we got our food there were times we couldnt find our waiteress. We needed clean plates and utensils after ours were cleared after the first course.  This restaurant is family style, with each dish serving 2-3 people. It's definitely a lot of food and I recommend coming here with a large group. The prices are fair for the amount of food you get. We had the house salad for the table (I really liked the dressing) and we got the eggplant parm.  For the parm, definitely ask for extra sauce on the side because it seemed to be lacking on the dish itself. There is also an unlimited bread basket of some great breads.  Overall, personally, I'm not a huge fan of family style, especially if you have very differing tastes at your table and I think you can get better Italian food in little Italy but carmines is definitely an experience so if you have a large group come with empty stomachs and enjoy!
The lamb-belly, beef-rib, and beef-brisket are phenomenally & sensationally cooked, but, unfortunately, get boring after a few bites. It's very succulent, overwhelming meat, and it needs something to cut the fat, maybe some lemon-lime-grapefruit-orange zest and/or juice, but the two sauces they provide really don't do it for me, at all. The sauces are tasty on their own, but they are too thick and too sugary for the meat, and don't actually enhance the experience, but, rather, are conflicting & actually disguise the meaty-meatiness. So maybe next time I'll just order these meats in sandwich form, which is a shame, but I'm sure they will be delicious.  Jamaican Spare-ribs and Sriracha Chicken-wings are definitely a winner, and absolutely crowdpleasers, as are the amazing beans with brisket. The potato salad is hit or miss, one time it was way too raw-vinegary, caustic and acrid, but last night it was bangin' spot-on terrific. And I really just do not like their mac and cheese or their cornbread.  Awesome location, secluded and spacious. Helpful, friendly staff. Nice atmosphere, warm ambiance.
I had the chicken and waffles or brunch, and was very disappointed.  The chicken didn't have much flavor, but the waffles were ok. My wife had mac and cheese which was super watery and bland. Quality to price gap is just too wide.  It's too bad, I love the location but it's not worth the price.
First time ever found noodle clots in my bowl. Boy chow was yellow and noodle was very little.  Sushi was good but soy-sauce was super salty.  Will not recommend this place.
Overall, I was impressed by how many people were there on a Wednesday night. Many people came after work for drinks since it was so close to time square, also a good amount of visitors waiting for their Broadway show. Let me tell you, definitely come here for the drinks. We tried the lavender monk and all three gin drinks, and loved every one of them. I stuck to other yelp reviewers recommendation and got the green pasta. it was absolutely delicious, and the pasta was just right with the shrimp.  The table also got a side of fries, which was huge and had a great aioli sauce. Definitely a place I would come back to again, make sure you make a reservation!
This a wonderful ramen place to hit up if you're in NYC. All the staff provided excellent service and the only time you could hear them speak english was when they were speaking directly to you. My friend and I felt like we were in Japan! Only down was that there is no boiled egg in the ramen and so you have to add a few dollars to get it. The pork buns were delicious and thicc! Calpico soda was refreshing and the lychee shochu highball was delicious! Would come back again and would recommend to friends and family.
Even on a Tuesday raining evening, this place is PACKED with millennials and tinder-dates. Who can say no to delicious Korean tapas for a fairly good price in the East Village area! Not an NYU student who just finished her evening class and wants to chill with her friends.  The Truffle Mac and Cheese was so delicious. Macaroni was cooked al dente and there was just the right amount of cheese and truffle to take me away from the conversation. The Kimchi Paella was another great tapas-- not overwhelmingly spicy, just a kick of tangy and spiciness from the kimchi-- topped with charred shrimp and mussels. When I took my first bite, I immediately tasted the mussel broth. The Angry Sweet Potatoe was another stellar. You can ask to put the cayenne pepper on the side. My friend cannot eat spicy food, and the server kindly accommodated us. Three dishes and the price came about $35. And best of all, our stomach was happily filled.  It may not be the best place to relax or chat with friends because the restaurant is always noisily packed, and tables are close to each other. However, servers were attentive. The 45 min wait was certainly worth it.
This is a popular place with great food, good location, so so service, and no atmosphere.  Yes, the dumplings are excellent.  We had the about six different dishes including the soup dumplings, pan fried dumplings, and pan fried buns.  They were all excellent.  I would recommend this place to everyone.
This cafe is convenient if you are visiting the Statue of Liberty as it is located on Liberty Island. They have a good selection of food including panini's, pizza and even sushi. I ordered the Southwest Chicken Panini and it was very good. It came with a pile of greens and some tomatoes. The chicken was tender and their was some fresh peppers that added some great flavor. This restaurant can be confusing as they give you your food and you have to wait in line to pay at a separate counter. Overall good food but the cafe can get a little crowded and you have to wait a long time to pay.
Really cozy environment. Nice and friendly staff . The miso soup was awesome ! And so was my sesame chicken. I have to go back and try the ramen .
Where do I start ... I am not sure how the manager Giovanni (if he didn't lie about his name) still has his job, he should not be in customer service. The nastiest attitude I have ever seen from a restaurant manager.  Guacamole with white smoked fish and no one at our table of 5 tasted white fish in there. As a matter of fact I am big fan of smoked white fish and it is a taste you can't just not notice. We thought we just got a regular guacamole so when the check came he was like well if you told me earlier I would do something .... haha what would you do? Actually put white fish in there ? And so now we have to pay for a plane guacamole but since we ate it ,he can't do anything about it.  Trio of fries was disguising and certainly not worth the price.  The rest of the dishes were ok but I would not come back for the food there aside from the nasty manager. Super overpriced for what it is. I get the fact that the rent is high but that does not justify such a mediocre delivery.  And I want to make it clear that the waitresses were very nice and that is the only reason we did leave the tip. I came up to the manager to let him know that we were very disappointed and that gratuity is only because we know it feeds the servers. The guy starts arguing with me ...  unbelievable.
"Awesome. As we were leaving, my wife said ""This is one of the better places we've eaten. Wasn't too pricey either."" Old style NYC. Andee took good care of us."
A bit disappointed on this choice for burgers.   Burger comes 'as-is' OR the waitress doesn't offer the burger at different temperatures.  So if you like well done burgers than maybe this is your place.  I do not like well done burgers and like the temperature of my burgers to be medium rare to rare.   I won't lie the guy sitting next to me was in love with his well done burger, and made google eyed comments to his girlfriend.   As for me, I wouldn't recommend this to other yelpers.  With the hike from Manhattan, the price of 15 dollars for the burger, and other burger establishments that exist I would pass on this place.
First time here - we had the pasta made inside the cheese wheel and substituted the prosciutto for shrimp, the uni pasta, and the duck salad.  The pasta in the cheese wheel didn't live up to its hype, it was overly salty in my opinion and did not have enough cheese in it for something that was rolled around in a cheese wheel.  The uni pasta was delicious!  It had the perfect amount of pink sauce and they gave a generous portion of uni too! Our duck salad appetizer did not come before our pastas did (those came super quickly), but the waitress apologized, gave us 2 free glasses of wine and a double portion of the duck salad.  The salad was dressed nicely and the duck cooked well.  I would probably only recommend coming here for the uni pasta!
"Let me start by saying the reason this place is getting one star is not because the food was terrible.  My girlfriend and I actually thought the food was GREAT and was not upset until we recieved the bill. And let me tell you why... We came in at about 10pm. My girlfriend and I go out for steak quite often. It is one of our favorite dinner dates, so we knew we had to try this place that people rave about in Williamsburg. We always order the Ribeye for 2. When we sat down, we asked for that, and the waitress says, ""unfortunately we only have our bigger cuts left about 60oz(bone about 10oz-14oz)"", that we usually do for 4 people. Of course we say, ""that fine.""We can always take leftovers home. No big deal! Food comes, look great. They sit the steak down and walk away. And immediately my girlfriend and I look at each other like oh...LOOKS LIKE THEY MIGHT OF FOUND A SMALLER CUT, PERFECT! I can tell you it looked like it was like about 30oz MAX (with the bone). Im being seriously generous. I know you lose about 25% with cook loss. NO WAY THIS WAS FOR FOUR PEOPLE. We ate the WHOLE THING. Not even stuffed or anything. We ask for the bill. Before it even came back. I lean over to my girlfriend, and say, ""watch these ass holes try to bill us for a 60oz steak."" AND SURE ENOUGH...bill comes the steak ALONE was $156.60(total was $200). Unlike most places they weight the steak and charge $2.70/lb, instead of a set price. Which is actually good business sense. I couldn't stop laughing. Of course we paid , left a 20% tip, and didn't complain. We just aren't those kind of people and what would really been resolved.  BUT WE WILL PROBABLY NEVER GO BACK! Just wasn't worth the money and they played us. Just to give you reference, we tried Wolfgang's like 2 weeks before, and got the roughly the same size steak(the alledged 58oz-60oz) for $100....AND we both had enough for lunch the next day! Nice try St. Anslem. You lost a potential faithful customer. We'll stick to Peter Lugers."
Nice decoration, Staff are wonderful, patient, great at keeping smiles on customer and the food have done very fast.  Recommended for small groups to have lunch and get some beer in financial district.
I hope the night we ate here was just an off night.   Salad was over dressed.   Several of the pasta dishes were over salted.   It was as if they assumed they were going to be cooking for heavily drunk people that would need extra seasoned food to taste anything.   For the prices they charge and the fact they are on they eater38 list, you would think they would be more reliable. Also,  the restaurant is very loud.
Our hopes were high as residents on the block, but Minnie's is nobody's local. We gave it 3 shots to make good on obvious newbie mistakes. But no, Indifferent service quickly dropped to just plain rudeness, as the hostess chronically devotes herself to friends & family and staff have followed suit. This, on top of a twee, overpriced menu makes Minnie's just another short-lived trust fund baby's flash in the pan, the sort LES has suffered more than it's fair share of.
This place is very authentic. I had many soup dumplings when I was growing up in China, and this place really reminded me of those days. Their dumplings have nice size, good taste, and the juice is just satisfying. They also have some selections of dim sum, and Szechuan food, which is great for a spicy food lover like me. On average the wait time is 1-2 min, and I get a seat. But I usually go there alone so that might be the reason. They have two big dining areas with plenty of seat, so if you go around 10pm or later, there's no need to wait in line. Service was ok, nothing real fancy. The get you your food pretty quickly, and are very helpful if you need get your water filled or order something else. Only draw back is they only accept cash. For me, I usually eat a lot, and spent around 23 dollars. So now you know how much to bring.
Unfortunately, I went here due to all of the great reviews and had a crappy, semi-disasterous experience.   I decided to have a later dinner with friends this past Wednesday.  We ordered the fried catfish basket, jambalaya mac & cheese, hush puppy appetizer, drinks, and the jambalaya.  Food and drinks came promptly except the hush puppies were not served and my friend received regular mac instead of the jambalaya mac.  No big deal- asked for our hush puppies and the right mac dish from another waiter as no one (including wait staff) could locate ours. 30 minutes and two asks later- still no mac & no hush puppies.  We asked another waiter for the third time and he seemed incredibly stressed (he actually pounded his hand on a column when realizing we still hadn't been helped) but said we should wait just a few more minutes.  Another gentleman came to apologize and the mac came out shortly after.  Our waiter showed up out of nowhere finally and asked if we wanted dessert as it would be on the house.  We ordered banana pudding. Another waiter brought out the fried banana pudding- amazing until you got to the frozen inside.  The ice cream it came with tasted like freezer burn.  5 minutes later, the regular banana pudding came out as we ordered- the waiter was confused as to why we already had fried banana pudding instead. As for the food, the catfish basket was flavorless. Jambalaya, hush puppies and mac were good.  The whole experience was just really a disaster as nobody ever knew what was going on so long story short, we definitely won't be returning.
It was a Thursday evening and I was getting together with a good friend from my youth, like age seven. She suggested this spot and it was convenient for us both. We agreed to meet at 6ish.  It was lively from the moment I walked in. We found seating at the bar, miraculously. Ok, we did steal a guy's seat who was standing next to it but not actually sitting for far too long...reminded me of old times with a cookie delivery truck when we...oh, never mind.  She was sipping wine and I opted for a cucumber martini, refreshing. The beers on tap were tempting as well. Nice selection. Chris at the bar makes quite a good drink and is a downright friendly chap. We also ordered food to wash down the cocktails with. We selected the artichoke appetizer and a spinich steak salad. Both were quite good.  The menu looked decent. I would definately like to come back and peruse it more throughly when I've not been on the run all day.  In sum, cool place to hang out and meet up with friends for a bite and drink. WARNING...I'll be back.
A few years back, Joya was really good. The food was delicious. However, I did not have the same experience two days ago. We were five people and asked for a table. They wanted to squeeze us in a table of 4 without putting another table together. Meanwhile there was a table of 6 also available where we could have sat comfortably. I had a pad see hue and it smelled burnt. It lacked flavor and the soft drinks didn't have any fizz.  Also- my sisters phone had died and she asked if there was a way they could charge it for her since she was far from home and they said no. (It's 2017 and everyone has phones! Why can't you charge it) I do understand some places have their set of rules, but they were rude when they said it. If we are paying customers then have some decency.  In any case, I wouldn't want to go back because I don't believe the food was worth it. I've had Thai food in much better places.
I've been quite down on Thai food of late. After a broadway show, we needed a Thai restaurant to satisfy my mom's desire for it.  This was the highest rated one on yelp nearby, and as usual Yelp came through. We arrived at about 5:45 PM so there was no a wait to get a seat.  We found a nice corner section and the service was generally good. We split a few orders of the steamed dumplings. They were piping hot, my only complaint was that it was a little bit to spicy for my likings. For the entree (which came out lightning fast),  I tried the duck noodles. I've never had duck at a Thai restaurant before and they really nailed the dish. It had just a touch of spiciness to it (mild) and this suited me just fine. My parents seemed to enjoy their Pad Thai a lot. I really can't complain much about the food. I think the waiters could have checked on us a little bit more, as we had to scramble to find them to get the check.  They had  $3 sapporro beer happy hour, which sounded like a good idea if I was in the mood to drink. I would return if in the area, because the food came out so fast and was so delicious.
MAMA MANJA MIA.......Bring Your Biggest Appetite and leave stuffed.  My wife and I decided to see a show on Broadway and have dinner at this Italian gem. They serve everything family style in huge massive portions so be prepared for a ton of food.  Reservations are recommended as it gets packed always. When we arrived our waiter Josh was outstanding and on point throughout our meal. We ordered the Carmine's Famous Antipasto Salad with a variety of meats and cheeses. Delicious! We then ordered grilled shrimp in a roasted garlic sauce over linguini.  Oh my God is all I can say.  We finished with a massive piece of NY Style cheesecake which was incredible and could not be remotely be finished. Great service and better food. Enjoy and prepare for a food coma nap afterword.
This is my moms go-to spot for Mother's Day. I always make a early reservation for brunch as they book up very quickly. It was an almost 2 hour wait the day of to be seated. Normally the food is on point and I am never disappointed. However, my meal fell a little flat this time. I ordered the carbonara pasta which would have been delicious, but when I took my first bite, it wasn't even hot. I guess it had been sitting in the kitchen waiting for the other dishes to be completed. I also ordered the kale Caesar salad which was disappointing as well. It was just kale with lardons and very little dressing. I wasn't expecting anything spectacular but it was less than average and Gastroteca has never been average. Our started, however, were absolutely delightful! We always order the Texas toast which is stuffed with Nutella and coated in corn flakes (YUM!). We also chose the banana ricotta donuts which were like fluffy pillows of deliciousness in your mouth. They didn't have a lot of banana flavor which is a plus for me and they were so perfectly fried. Those a definite must try!
I was so annoyed with this place. Me and my friend came in, the hostess that greeted us was friendly and immediately took us back. We sat down and was given menus by a server. That was it. She literally disappeared! We didn't see her for at least 15 minutes later. She comes back and hastily asks of we're ready. My friend has questions and she's literally annoyed and gives a half assed answer. I decided not to pay any mind figuring she was busy with other customers. But it wasn't just that.  Food took around a good another 15 mins to come. My friend had to flag down the server to ask how long it would take, she gets annoyed saying that it's cooking. No shit lady. We wanted a time frame. Food comes out and quite honestly it was ............below average. The burger I had was just disappointing. It was piled high with so much classic burger ingredients, yet no flavor. How does that happen? How does a burger have no flavor? Me and my friend split an order of wings which were honestly the best part of the meal. Flavorful and packed a punch. My friend ordered a side of fries and then when her entrée comes, she sees it already has fries with it. She paid for extra fries which she wouldn't need. Our server made no point to notify us of that. Very upsetting service. She disappears once again and then some other guy comes with our check. My friend was so furious she didn't tip at all. I guess the server knew that as well. We didn't see her at all. A waste of time. The bar is too packed. People are too loud and the food is too expensive. Depressing food that shouldn't be eaten by anyone.
"For all its gourmet famous chef pluses, we had a nice dinner but for several reasons we won't return: 1) The front entrance is narrow and the wait at the Maitre d' table near the bar was just awful. We had a reservation for a party of 6, and four of us arrived 10 minutes early and he wouldn't seat us until all 6 were present. That would be fine if they had room to wait other than being outdoors in the cold. Instead, my 87 year-old mother-in-law and petite daughter are elbowed and nudged by every patron and waiter as they go by the very narrow space near the coat check. 2) We sit, and these huge chunks of Taranova bread arrive, but no olive oil or butter - What? 3) The wine is very good despite the fact that is marked up over 200-300% over retail ($14.99 of house prosecco is $40 and a $34 bottle of red is $90), but then they insist on pouring it for you. While i'm trying to eat, I have to manage who gets it, some people don't drink red wine and if they do will not drink the 4 oz glass the waiter automatically pours and will just leave it. Please let me manage the bottles. 4) The different pastas are the ""best"" items on the menu and were all cooked perfectly and tasted great, but at $24 to $29 for 1/3 of a pound plate they are over priced. 5) The entrees were delicious, the branzino, rabbit and lamb chops were fairly priced at $32 to $37. 6) The desserts at 15 to $17 were very good, but over priced. Overall, it was a nice evening, but i think its status as one of the 50 most popular restaurants in   NYC set the tone and the price point. Give me Lupa instead."
Everything was good! I would come back here for sure.  Small prosecco pour  Best tomato soup I have ever had  Shrimp toast-I loved it, my husband didn't.   We shared a Shepherd pie type main course and is was delicious. Perfect size portion, smallish  Broccoli on the side was just ok. Boring. Nothing special.
The service is so crazy here. Completely overshadows how good the food is. After long days of working, the last thing I can put up with is waitress harassment while dining.
While 3 of my friends & I were waiting for our party of about 14, one waitress offered us Chips & Guacamole but didn't even tell us we'd be charged $9 for it. I've been to a Mexican restaurant before & we weren't charged for something like that but I'm pretty sure if it weren't free, they'd tell us. I kind of felt tricked. Gratuity and tip was really outrageous. I ordered the meal with Shrimp and it was a misleading description compared to how it actually looked. The shrimp didn't taste that great. The rice, beans, & avocado, however, was alright. The set up of the restaurant is nice but I really wouldn't eat here again.
The service was absolutely terrible. I don't think we actually had a waiter as our table was sparsely covered by a combo of people, including the hostess. We tried the Ricotta pizza, which was had a completely burnt crust, yet was luke warm upon arrival. The chicken was also undercooked, which is dangerous for chicken. The fried dough dessert was covered in powdered sugar to mask how bland and over fried it was. Just terrible overall.
There was no wait when I got there, which isn't THAT surprising considering it was 6:30 pm on a Monday night. We were seated right away so that was great.  The food was overall only okay. That's the main reason for the three stars. The only thing that I really enjoyed was the biscuit... Other than that, nothing really blew me away. The chicken was juicy and didn't have any excess oil, but it wasn't hot. It was warm at best. The Mac and cheese was also only okay... But the cole slaw was better! I enjoyed that more than the Mac and cheese.  What bugged me was the dessert. I'm sure it was just our slice because I've seen pictures of other people's pies but ours was SO small. When the waitress placed it on the table, I was shocked. It was really tiny and it was also $5. That price would have been okay if we got a normal sized slice, not half of a slice.
I arrived at 10AM on a Sunday to easily land a corner table with no wait, thankfully. The service, first of all, was fabulous. Despite arriving as a solo guest, the waitress kindly allowed me to take a great corner table by the window. I ordered the green shakshuka, which was excellent. I liked the clean, fresh, tangy tomatillo flavor--I've never had green shakshuka before, only the typical red--while the two sunny-side eggs were perfectly done. The dish paired well with the two slides of toasted challah bread. The medium-sized portions were sufficient.  I've also ordered the Madame Freda via Caviar. I didn't love it, especially since the duck was a bit tough and the cheese a bit hardened, but that might be more a function of having been delivered in the cold.
Had a horrible experience here, which is unfortunate considering it was one of the places we were looking forward to the most while visiting NY.  The service was not at all what I expected for the price, reputation and Yelp score. Our server was a lunk; zero personality, energy and did very little to make us feel at home. He did a horrible job of walking us through the menu, answering questions, etc.  We both got the Chefs Tasting Menu and I must admit, the food was very good. Everything was cooked wonderfully, seasoned beautifully and plated to the level you'd expect.  That said, you're paying for the service and atmosphere as well and that's what Vitae was lacking during our visit. I think the check was around $350, not crazy but you can do much better for the price in NY.  To be honest, the place was pretty dead for a Thursday night -- perhaps our service was indicative of an overall decline in performance? Hard to say but I don't plan on recommending Vitae or going back.  In fact, if you're reading this review and interested in a fantastic Italian meal, check out ViceVersa --- delicious menu, impeccable service and charming atmosphere.
Tacos are really good! A friend and I tried different ones and they were all nicely flavored. But get your napkins ready, it's easy to get a mess. We also tried the highly recommended breakroom fries. It was a bit too heavy for us and we couldn't finish. The service was good and fast and we liked the atmosphere =))
Meh.. this is not the spot for Chinese in NYC... after all, it's located on the circusy, touristy and college-student laden St. Marks Place!  We ordered an array of items, including the scallion pancake, salt and pepper shrimp, sauteed water spinach, crab xiao long bao and 2 other XLB... nothing was *terrible*, the shrimp was overly coated and fried, the water spinach was the best item and the xiao long bao definitely lacked real flavor (Note: I didn't try the pork one since I'm pescatarian). Little nuance... the taste of the dumpling and the filling somehow combined and it all just tasted like a doughy wet ball.  I know it's at the end of the 7 train. But seriously, just go to the New World Mall Food Court in Flushing or Nan Xiang Dumpling House...  There is very little reason to eat at The Bao UNLESS you are a tourist, drunk college student, 20 something who is hungry after a bar crawl...
There is ALWAYS a line out the door.  I went on a Sunday at noon and luckily I was seated right away.  REASONS YOU MAY NOT LIKE THIS PLACE: If you are in a rush, don't like crowded spaces or sharing tables, then you probably won't like this place.  It is a communal setting so we were seated with 2 other couples at a round table but everyone is busy slurping the soup dumplings so you prob won't notice  anyway. The food is great (and you WILL be full) and it's so cheap for the city ($36 for 3 dishes including tip) so this balances out all the bad stuff  The soup dumplings are made fresh and are good, but if only going for these, there are other places in Chinatown that serve pork soup dumplings.  (example: shanghai cuisine on Mott St)  RECOMMENDATIONS: 1) soup dumplings  2) chefs special: shredded spicy beef if you like spice 3) the cabbage wonton soup if you wanna opt for a soup (+add white pepper) 4) bring cash  5) 15% tip is included in the bill but I gave a few extra dollars
My girlfriend and I celebrated our anniversary here yesterday evening, and we're glad we did! The food was amazing and the service was impeccable -- our waiters and waitresses really did a fantastic job making us feel comfortable. I must've had my glass refilled, like, eight times throughout the evening, and only once did my glass fall below the 25% mark. Exceptional service! We each had the dinner tasting menu ($165 per person before tax). I'm not going to go into detail for each course because that would make this review the length of a term paper, but I will say that the chefs made phenomenal meals with ingredients which I normally wouldn't eat. The marinated scallops with blood orange, fennel, and pumpkin seeds, for example, was surprisingly delicious -- I usually don't like pumpkin and would never eat the seeds, but I really enjoyed it! I also very much liked the squash tortellini with bone marrow (super rich!), and the wagyu beef was just a grand slam. Literally everything about the evening was perfect, from the ambiance to the decoration to the service to the food. I didn't feel at all rushed over the course of 2.5 hours, and we both left with full stomachs! (I note this because I'm always a tad nervous having tasting menus for dinner -- the portions are pretty small per meal, but we certainly left satisfied!) The experience was absolutely phenomenal, and I can't wait to eat at more Michelin-rated restaurants!
It's a great deal for the price... and perfect for our neighborhood.  It was rather late when we went in for take out.  My lamb cumin with noodles was good. Very much on the spicy side.  I just wished that not so many of the noodles were cooked fused/stuck together and in some cases still a touch raw.... However, my wife's dumplings were really good, tho. *** I did go back another day - earlier... and the noodles were cooked just the way they were suppose to be.  Not fused or stuck together. In fact there was a young woman was pulling them fresh right in front of me. It's amazing how busy they are, but the line and orders move very fast.
This cute, quaint and intimate spot was perfect for a Date. The lights were very low, candles everywhere and wine shelves on every wall displaying the quench of Italy. However the food didn't offer the same. Between the clamari, pasta and steak that we ordered. Everything tastes the same. The noodles for the pasta were undercooked and there wasn't anything spectacular about this food. Our waiter was interesting, we called him Luigi which was fun but in true honesty I barely could understand what he was even recommending to us.  Then we had desert. Which was the best part of the meal and we both agreed that we would come back for the wine and cheesecake only. Other than that we weren't sold at all.  In summary. Go to have a glass of wine and enjoy the ambience but save your big appetite for another restaurant.
I only tried two things on the menu this time... I recently stopped by this quintessential hole in the wall after reading all the great reviews on yelp, and I have to say I was not disappointed. What it lacks in décor it more than compensates for with flavors that dance on the palate and value that cannot be beaten. They do not have a catalog-massive menu as they stick to what they know and excel in - noodles and dumplings.  Must try: My handsome husband and I ordered the Brisket noodle soup and boiled dumplings (try it with the chili oil!). The soup was loaded with an abundance of delicious hand pulled noodles and just enough pieces of meat and boy choy. The dumplings (also hand-made) were succulent with every bite! Again, for those of you that are not lighting your cigars with $20 bills the taste/value combination here has no equal!
The cafe on the side of the actual restaurant was ok! My chicken noodle soup was NOT good at all no flavor. The fries were ok.
Reservation at 1:45pm on a Saturday. Arrived at 1:15pm and a million people were also waiting for their tables. No biggy, there's a bar up front to help you kill time and a big window so you can people watch. We got seated promptly at 1:45pm. We ordered the wedge salad, baked potato, steak for one (sirloin cut), and rib steak (ribeye cut). The wedge salad was a refreshing start to our dinner, totally recommend it. Comes with little bacon bits on tp. Steak was good but I must say Keen's is still my favorite.  The waiter was really nice. He never rushed us. It came out to $100/person after tip. Please note: CASH ONLY. You need to make a reservation well in advance and they get booked really quick.
Yelped for something near IKEA for brunch--The Good Fork sounded like a good idea with raving reviews...with a caveat. We arrived on Saturday afternoon to a nearly vacant restaurant. I am aware of the outdoor seating in the back. We sat at one of the two cozy tables by the front entrance. Service could've been more attentive as other parties who arrived later than us were seated, offered water, and placed orders before us.  Pork Belly Hash $12 -My fiancé enjoyed the hash, but was lacking pork belly. I'd say there might've been 2 pieces of sliced pork belly diced into little cubes. The pork belly consisted of mainly skin and fat. If it weren't for the two sunny side eggs, she would've been still hungry after eating the dish. Bibimbop $16 - Portions were also small as I recall 4-5 small slices of skirt steak in the bowl. Skirt steak was flavorful, just wish there was more. The spicy gochogang sauce wasn't too spicy but was necessary to complete the bibimbop. Folks that often eat Korean authentic bibimbop will be disappointed. Dumplings $10 - Overly cooked and nothing outstanding. The dipping sauce was very rich and overwhelmed the dumplings. At $2 a piece, the pork and chive dumplings were overpriced. These dumplings come nowhere near the $1 dumplings you get in Chinatown.  I would not recommend this dish.  Overall just an average experience and will not be coming back when in the area.
Just had an incredibly disappointing experience here at lunch today. Today was the last day of my father's cancer treatment. I work in the neighborhood, and my dad suggested that he could come uptown and we could go have a celebratory lunch at Red Rooster. I arrived at 1 pm. We were seated around 1:10 and ordered right away, informing our server that I had to leave by 2 for a meeting back at the office. He said that would be fine. Our mains did not come out until after 1:50, a full 40 minutes after we ordered. Considering I got a sandwich and my dad got shrimp and grits, I have no idea why it took that long, especially since we let them know off the bat that we had a slight time crunch. If they weren't able to fill our order in time, they should have told us. I had to take my sandwich to go, and our celebratory lunch was ruined. Red Rooster is clearly not catering to the local community if you can't have a midday sandwich there in under an hour--the max amount of time working people have to take lunch during the week. Instead, it's catering to tourists and day trippers who can afford to sit for over an hour at lunch in the middle of the day. Disappointing on so many levels. I won't be returning.
Absolutely delicious carne asada tacos. Pricey at $3.50 each but that's Manhattan for you.
Visited here at 7pm on Monday night. Waiting time was about 25min. for two people. I got beef buns and karaka ramen. Beef buns were tasty! I really liked the soft and moisty texture of the white bread!  I also enjoyed eating karaka ramen. It wasnt that spicy but delicious! (definitely rich in flavor) I highly recommend buns and karaka ramen. Regarding services, I was highly satisfied. The waitress was really thorough in explaining menu and even gave us some recommendation.  I wouldn't say it is the best ramen place I have visited but a decent place where I would come back again in the future!
Shot glass, half filled with ice/half filled with muddled fruit, splash of whiskey - $12. Looks like a vault inside. Tourist trap...
Absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in NYC.  I've been to scarpetta 3x now and each time I leave more satisfied than the last.  Located in the heart of meat packing its perfectly convenient if you want to go out afterwards.   Scarpetta provides a great first impression.  If you choose to have a drink at the bar your provided with a basket of homemade potato chips which are delicious.  Once seated you are presented with a bread basket that includes Stromboli.  Yes, you read that correctly... I said Stromboli!!!  The food is fantastic! The portions are not huge so I would recommend you get an app, pasta and dinner unless you split multiple apps.  The food is very tasty but not heavy or greasy.   The spaghetti is delicious and a staple at scarpetta.  The short rib pasta is slightly sweet and very light.  The halibut has a delicious crusty top on top of a delicate lemon sauce.  Everything on the menu is Absolutely delicious!
I don't understand. Is it a hipster thing? Bad hair, bad clothes, bad music, bad food? This wasn't just bad ethiopian food, this was bad food, period. It tasted like what happens when something turns out terribly in my slow cooker. That musty, metallic taste I can never figure out how it happened.  Ethiopian food is always delicious to me, even if it isn't the best. The richness of spices and the depth of flavor is unmatched by any cuisine, so I can't understand how this place managed to screw it up. My suspicion is that everything is just in a warmer all day long. Nothing tasted fresh, like everything was made in a giant batch the day before and just constantly re-warmed.  Food aside, everything else left everything to be desired. There was no hot water in the bathroom, and when you're eating with your hands, you're really trying to get a good scrub in there. Never in my life of Ethiopian food has additional injera been an additional charge. The entire waitstaff seemed like they were afraid of us. And it's 2017. You need to be mind-blowing or super historic to not take cards.  Never had I had a meal where I couldn't wait to brush my teeth just to get the taste out of my mouth.
I have been here three times already. Each time the experience was memorable! Upon entering jonathan and his wait/bar staff make you feel super welcomed. Both times I have been lucky that I have snagged the last few seats. This is a small place but the efficiency is incredible. For example when it's packed you never once feel like they forgot about you. The kitchen is also very fast at sending out the dishes even during heavy periods. On my first visit I ordered the tamarind Mojito. It was the perfect balance of sweet and sour tartness with just enough alcohol that only an experienced mixologist could obtain. Up next was the 3 taco dish. It's a variety of 3 different tacos- chicken, pernil, and beef. Each one is more tastier than the other and the meat juicer to than the next. It's filling but still leaves you room to try something else. On this occasion I ordered the wings. I am very picky about my wings and always request them extra crispy and drumsticks only. A lot of places would not honor giving you drumsticks only. The waiter took my order exactly to the detail and did not deny me my special request. Wings arrived and were extremely flavorful with just enough kick. I will order them again. On my second visit I ordered the trio tacos (again). Just because I loved them the first time so much. But like I said you still have some room for something else. So in this visit I ordered the skirt steak lollipops. Cooked to perfection, very tender and flavorful. They came over a bed of mixed greens and chimichurri sauce on top of the lollis. I shared with my best friend. She loved them as well. But commented they were a tad salty for her. I liked the seasoning.  My most recent visit I tried the patacones. They had small chunks of pork on top. Crispy and plus salty as they should be. I also tried the passion fruit caipirinha. It was on point. This time a bunch of friends made it for brunch and then I arrived. Jonathan was such a great host everyone stayed thru dinner. This place is just amazing for all type of events and crowds. There is easy street parking at all times in surrounding area. It's a small place but the wait is certainly worth it!! Till my next visit! I cannot wait!!!
Try the spicy wings lol they are pretty damn good.
I went second time with some friends.. Same experience as first time...the service is extremely poor. The servers need training on attitude and being more cordial
Came here for brunch on a Saturday with my boyfriend. We got the duck platter that came with a couple of sides and a scallion pancake. Everything was amazing, especially the duck. I was actually annoyed I needed to share because I wanted the whole thing to myself. Next time I will tell my boyfriend to get his own.
My experience at Vitae left me scarred. I was delighted at 'scoring' a reservation at this upscale, exciting looking 5th Ave restaurant on a summer saturday night. But of course I got a reservation - apparently everyone else is in on the joke that Vitae actually is.  The interiors were promising, the restaurant mostly empty. The food was disappointing and disgusting. A seemingly grilled octopus appetizer was essentially raw flesh that sent a spray of salt down my throat. I still gag at the thought of it.  My Cacio e Pepe was neither Cacio or Pepe - it was thick, dry and sad fettuccine pathetically garnished with chives. I looked keenly for the cured egg yolk, pecorino and parmesan broth that were promised on the menu - 0 luck. I'm all for creativity, but why mess with classics to such a disgraceful extent?  My one star goes out to the service - the waiter was kind enough to replace the napkin I had to spit my octopus into.   Save yourself the time, money, and pain. Just don't go
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVR GONE TO THE FLUSHING LOCATION... This place is not as good.  Ordered the pork soup soup dimplings which were a couple of bucks more than the flushing location.  ALSO NOTE: they give you 6 dumplings wheras the flushing on gives you 8.   The dumplings were a little doughey. However, the soup was good.The scallion pancakes were definitly dry and not worth it in my opinion.  Ordered the beef fried rice and the rice was overcooked as if its been sitting in the  pot too long.  If you know the flushing location which is the original, this one has nothing on that location. Service was good though. Everyone was nice.
"Insipid and flavorless empanada. The place looks nice but what I really wanted was for the empanada to be tasty. Nor the chicken or the beef empanadas were good.  The ""loaded Salchipapas"" looked more like home fries, and it had barely any cheese. At least they stayed true to the ketchup and pink sauce. But I guess to help it a little or in my opinion...to finally destroy the dish, they added pineapple sauce!!!  Overall, I would not recommend this place for anyone that has had Colombian food elsewhere. Because they will definitely be disappointed unless they have a health condition that prevents them from eating with seasoned food whatsoever."
The food is amazing here! The avocado-toast is the best, sooo good! We love the crowded atmosphere here. We visited the smiths last year also, we had the same good experience then.
Great expectations based on all the good reviews. I am somewhat of a pizza, meatball, and spaghetti aficionado so came here based on pretty good reviews for the meatballs and pizza. Overall not sure why they got such great reviews. The meatballs were good but not great. The Kale salad was overwhelmed by the citrus dressing to where that was all you could really taste. The spaghetti might have been better if the sauce was not so thick and pasty. And the Sapprosetto/pepperoni/vodka pizza was good but not great. There are far better pizza places near Times Square than this. Service and ambiance was very good.
The food was good but not enough to rave about. I went on a date night, and the atmosphere was perfect for that. Small cosy space, dimly lit, great selection of wines and we got a corner table with a view. I'd go back for that oh-so quaint feeling, but not so much for the food. Unfortunately for them, there is better Italian in the city.
Waited months to try this. Went with my boyfriend and my parents for a belated THANK YOU for helping us move to Astoria. We had heard the hype, and had a few personal friends tell us it was a must. We watched the lines grow through the fall with people waiting to get a table, and we continue to see the vestibule fill with folks waiting to be seated. We were told it'd be a 15min wait when we went, and they offer you free wine while you wait - that's adorable. We didn't have time to verbally take them up on that, because our table was ready...within 3 minutes. We got the greek salad and the spicy feta dip to start. If you've ever walked past the outside tables, you've seen the greek salad, and likely salivated. It comes with a BLOCK of feta on top. The large was more than enough for the 4 of us. The feta dip was SO GOOD. Salty greek goodness. We tried a number of their seafood options - all were delicious. I had the greek shrimp. Really tasty and filling. The spinach pie was really good as well.  They brought out a delicious complimentary dessert that we all agreed really sealed the deal. The bill was surprisingly less expensive than I was anticipating. That's always nice. Can't wait to go back. It is worth the wait, and is not over-hyped. You've got to try it!
Came during the lunch special on a saturday and did not regret it one bit. there are long lines for the restaurant but it goes fast and they will text you when it's your time. Plus it's a cute street to kill time so no harm to me waiting around for a while.  The table comes with a plate of fresh bread (there's some olives in it and some sesame seeds on top) which is piping hot and the best way to start your meal. I tried the fried feta cheese platter which is gigantic and comes with a salad (good thing I didn't order that separate greek salad!)  The salmon was outstanding - it felt like a whole pound of fish for $15 plus a side of lemon potatoes. I do think the lemon potatoes are overrated so I would skip those if I came back. My friend got the calamari dish which was outstanding. Grilled to perfection and perfectly seasoned.  Lunch social doesn't come with any dessert and I was honestly so stuffed I couldn't eat more if I wanted.
Went for happy hours with friends, nice drinks and small plates food! Would come again for sure!
if you pay anything less than $15 for a lobster roll, it'll probably be shit. So when you hear your total for a lobster roll, bag of chips, and drink at LL, just pay and know you're in for a treat. Super cool employees, great roll, and cool location. I tried the taste of maine, which is 3 half rolls, (shrimp, crab, and lobster) with a drink and chips for I believe $23. That's a pretty good deal. Although all were great, I prefer the lobster roll... with a little less oregano.
We came here on a Saturday afternoon around 3p. The hostess said that it would be around a 30 minute wait but it ended up only be 10 minutes or less. Then another hostess gave us the dinner menu instead of the brunch and the waiter ended up taking it away and giving us the right menu. It took a while for the waiter to get to us as well...  Vegetarian Fried Chicken & Waffle- 5/5 It really does taste like chicken. The fried part was delicious and so were the waffles! It also comes with three types of butter. I thought my dish was small but it's a heavy meal- I couldn't finish.  Mac and Cheese- 5/5 One of the best mac & cheese I've ever had. Super rich and creamy.
Had a great time in NYC and Roberta's great pizza definitely helped in making the trip a great one. Although we didn't stay in to eat at Roberta's, we did grab some pizzas to go to eat at the Brooklyn House hotel where we stayed at. I went with a classic margherita pizza and it was great. Very simple, clean, great tasting pizza. The whole concept behind Roberta's is very dope.
The pastas are good - I didn't try the one from the cheese wheel after reading reviews about how salty it is. I forgot the names of the dishes I ordered..so I'll just describe them. Octopus appetizer - The meat is so tender, but the plate was so small. I shared it amongst 3 people, and we each got like 1-2 bites each.  Uni pasta - the flavor isn't too overwhelming (which I liked). However, the portion is on the smaller side.. All 3 of us agreed that this was the best dish. Pasta with bolognese - Pretty good. Nothing special. Lamb ravioli - This was pretty good, but as I mentioned, the portion was really small. Overall, I just wanted to see the pasta wheel from afar, but I wasn't toooooo impressed with the dishes. It's pretty good here, but I definitely want to check out other restaurants before returning.
Wow!! Was in the neighborhood visiting family and took a chance on this place that just opened. The food was outstanding - seriously have never had this kind of food in this area before. Someone told us the chef used to run Tom Collicchio's Craftbar in Manhattan and so that explains it. Jealous of my family who live by this joint cause I'd be here all the time! The food is primarily Italian but fancier, more upscale and delicious. What's nice is the place doesn't feel overly fancy; it's super cozy and quaint. Staff were very friendly and checked on us many times. We had the scallops, which were sliced thin and melt in your mouth. As was the monkfish in this butter sauce - holy cow, awesome. We also took a chance on the octopus appetizer which the server recommended and it was also tasty and unlike anything I've had.  Can't wait to go back - great to see places like this now exist in Bay Ridge!
Agree with the other reviews on here. Small portions of very good food, but over priced. Don't bother going for restaurant week for dinner because you're not getting much of a deal at all. Had we ordered everything a la carte and not during restaurant week, it actually would have been cheaper? Not sure how that is a deal. Meatball app is good, as well as the rice balls. Chicken Milanese and papardelle tasted very good also, very home made tasting. Just didn't feel like it was money well spent.
"Hidden gem in South Street Seaport. I've been in the neighborhood for three years now and tried it for the first time Friday night. It's easy to walk in and get a seat. It looks like a dive bar and has that authentic feel, and the food and service is amazing! I'm definitely coming back and plan to be a regular. There is way too much on their menu that's a ""must try."" Food: Our group had the seafood combination and mac and cheese bites for an app. I definitely suggest it both, especially the fried mac and cheese bites! For dinner I ordered the crunchy fried rice with chicken. It is the most unique fried rice I've ever had and tasted amazing. The hot sauce it comes with is good but only in all doses as it's extremely spicy. Drinks: Nothing on tap, but has a full liquor bar and good beer selection. They have no drink menu but the servers can name everything they have for you. Ambience/Service: The staff is fun and super friendly! They all seem to help run the entire place...serving, bartending and running food. We had our server walk around giving us and other tables free shots of Jameson so we enjoyed shots with the whole bar. I'll probably come back to watch some games in the future too."
"As a math major, I highly doubt the computational ability of Thai Market's staff. Here's a bill of my recent meal. It's $31 without tax, and $33.75 with tax. As we know, tips should be calculated with regard to the percentage of total price BEFORE tax. Many restaurants make the mistake to calculate tips according to the total price after tax, I get it. But on this bill, as on many others I've got here, Thai Market calculated the tips according to a price EVEN HIGHER THAN TOTAL PRICE AFTER TAX!!! Let's do simple math, our meal was $33.75 after tax, so the 15% of that price should be $5.0625, while the real 15% tip according to the price before tax ($31) is $4.65. I have absolutely no idea why the suggested 15% tip on the bill was $5.27!!!!! How did they calculate it?!!!!  The suggested 18% and 20% tips were also wrong! Worse even, Thai Market introduced a new credit card policy that requires customers to write down their tips before swiping the card. Once for a meal of $25 I wrote down the real 15% tip of $3.75. But on the debit card statement Thai Market charged their suggested ""15%"" tip of $4.25. While they did not return the evidence: the bill with our handwritten $3.75 on it, they even included the statement ""we cannot adjust the tip after the transaction."" $0.5 is no big deal, but CAN YOU PLEASE DO YOUR MATH RIGHT and RESPECT YOUR CUSTOMERS?! And the worst was, this meal I decided to pay cash. I paid $40 dollars for a $33.75 meal (after tax) and they DID NOT EVEN BOTHER to give me the change. Come on, even adding YOUR completely wrong 18% tip to the bill, the total still does not exceed $40!!! I will not come back again. (Some of my evidences included)"
Nice little intimate space... the food is good. I had the shrimp and fries.. the chipotle aioli sauce was really good. Drinks were good but I believe they're overpriced. The Claire Huxabtle taste like juice and the Lonely lady is okay. Didn't like the sour winter.. too sour.  Friday night had a live dj... cool atmosphere
pretty confused w all of the high ratings ... not sure if they are used to traditional cuban food ...  this place is definitely trying to be trendy w it's dishes, maybe because they are in hell's kitchen ... but luke warm, reheated food is what we got ... and for the price point it should've been much better staff is friendly and atmosphere is nice... so was pretty bummed the food was lousy...  ordered cuban benedict and a cuban sandwich  cuban benedict:  english muffins were hard, ham was cheap deli meat, pork was flavorless and hard from being reheated... had hard crusty spots from where it got burnt cuban sandwich:  they smothered it will garlic aioli which made it super greasy and completely killed the traditional flavor this sandwich should be ... and the ham and pork were the same issues as above  i wish the former restaurant was still there from 2012 CASA HAVANA .... those sandwiches were amazing!  so sad they are gone ... this place is a disappointing replacement  we were so unhappy w the food we politely paid and made our way back to HAVANA CENTRAL TIMES SQUARE and ate there ... they have amazing food w true cuban sandwiches ... i have a review of that place too
Extremely authentic flavor. I haven't had Kao Fu with this flavor outside anywhere in the US. Instantly transported me back. Plenty of vegetarian options too. Thanks so much Yaso Tangbao!
I have had better Argentinian food in Astoria and Rego Park. The flavor is ok and the portion is kinda small to what I ordered. I ordered a Parillada for approx $50. However, the same amount of money and the same theme will be less price in Astoria and more quantity. The flavor is ok, but a bit chewy for the steak... Therefore, I don't think its worth coming to this place for Argentinian food.
Another soul food restaurant, another let down. I know Melba's is famous but the quality sure doesn't scream it. We went in earlier today about 5pm and were seated near the entrance. First thing I noticed -- no joke it smelled like a bathroom. It was a really overwhelming unpleasant bathroom smell that filled half the restaurant. We asked to be moved to the opposite room, no problem. We had a cool female waitress but the man that came to bring the food out looked like he hated his job or something. Soon as the food hit the table a bunch of flies came around. We ordered three plates of: Eggnog waffles Tilapia with mango sauce Wine braised Ribs Collard greens Mac and cheese In addition to: Ginger ale 2 Malibu Melba's (alcoholic beverage) The food was good, zero complaints on taste (tender meat, good seasoning, side orders were good) but the flies swarming around our table really ruined it. We had to watch our plates carefully while swatting them, and so we asked another waiter for a food cover so we could eat with some peace of mind. He was nice enough to retrieve it for us.  The Malibu Melba's were pretty good, nice balance of fruit flavor and alcohol. I decided to get a Malibu after rejecting the Sexy Sangria which tasted like garbage, too much alcohol. Question, what type of soul food restaurant serves no cornbread? I didn't see that anywhere on the menu. The total bill came up to a whopping $95 (including 10% tip which is bare minimum and you're forced to tip). Ripoff in my opinion considering the bathroom odor, the flies landing on you while trying to eat, it's not fancy, the food being good but not magnificent to warrant that price. Another thing, although the waitress we had was nice, we had to keep flagging her down, and it was a turnoff when she was hovering over the table staring hawk eyed telling us how much we could tip, whether 10%, 15%, etc. You should let the customer decide. This place is ok but it didn't strike me as somewhere I need to return. In other words, overrated.
I guess this place is always teeming with tourists and locals alike whether it's Valentine's Day or not.  They like the ambiance, the vibe, and maybe even the food. There's something warmly familiar about the place, though I've never been here before.  I did the most unoriginal thing: celebrate a birthday dinner in the most clichè restaurant instead of venturing into a so-called hidden gem.  And ordered the most expected dish and dessert, so I won't be surprised by its lackluster quality. I must say, that the plain-looking lobster risotto was quite delicious. The wait staff is incredibly helpful and accommodating.  And I enjoyed watching my kids holding a pleasant conversation though they may just be secretly making fun of us.
I would give 0 stars if I could. I was meeting my cousins for brunch and rushed over a bit late. I asked a guy sitting at the bar what time it was. He ignored me. He looked right at me and turned his back on me. That's right: it was the OWNER. The food was not great either. This place is around the corner from me and I will NEVER go back. Who does this guy think he is? He lost a good customer and I've told my neighbors and my friends to find another place as well. DON'T TREAT PEOPLE LIKE YOU'RE A KING PAL.
Very authentic Mexican tacos. Ingredients are nice and fresh.  They also have natural juices like Tamarind, which I love, but find it a little on the expensive side.   Overall-will come here again for lunch when in the mood for Mexican tacos.
Apps: lobster bisque and buffalo shrimp. the apps were really good.  Main: Fish & Chips and Horseradish salmon. The fish and chips sucked. No flavor. the tartar sauce sucked too. The salmon was good and the mashed potatoes were good too.
If you're ok with spending a bit more, I'd go with their restaurant week menu if you have the chance. A+ in terms of taste and portion sizes! Personal favorites were their grilled pineapple salad (grilled pineapples, shrimp, cilantro, cucumbers and some spice) and their Khao Soi (curry and noodles) The appetizers themselves could've been a meal. Not to mention their Halo Halo dessert that's shaved ice, condensed milk, Rice Krispies, scoop of ice cream and flan!
The first time I ate at Wilma Jean iI liked the food. We ordered one of everything to try it out (so much hype). I did think the thigh and iceberg were mini but it was tasty fare.  Last night my friend and I ordered $32 worth of food and drink and gave $40 cash to pay the check. OUR SERVER DIDN'T BRING OUR CHANGE BACK TO THE TABLE. I have worked in hospitality and that is never, ever something you do. No matter how yummy, this gives Wilma Jean one star. How presumptuous that you tipped yourself $8 on a $32 check! Sure, it's only like $1.50 over 20% but how RUDE.
I ate her at a group business meeting/dinner and the service was friendly and fast, the food was all good (nothing was disappointing) and they had a great wine list... cocktails were OK too... I probably wouldn't eat here as my first choice for a private/personal dinner engagement (as I tend to not eat at Italian restaurants in the US) but for a business dinner this suited us perfectly and the food/service/welcome was spot on...   Would definitely recommend and come back again...
I honestly loved every single meat I had here. I haven't tried all the BBQ spots in New York yet but Fette Sau serves some mouth-watering delicious smoked pieces of meat. They are leaps and bounds better than Mighty Quinn and Dinosaur BBQ. The set-up here is similar to Mighty Quinn (if you're familiar), you line up and order meat by the pound, then find communal seating to devour your acquired meats. There's a different line to order your drinks, as well.  Between my boyfriend and I, we ate too much but we pretty much sampled every piece of meat available that day. We had the beef short ribs, beef brisket, slab bacon, pulled pork, spicy pork sausage and pork spare ribs. Everything was what I expect in a good BBQ..dry rubbed (I'm not fond of wet rubs especially on ribs), smoky flavor, juicy, lean & fatty (fat rendered so well) and tender meats. They definitely know what they're doing here. I'm salivating just thinking about it now.
I was excited to try this place out after seeing all the positive reviews here on Yelp. Came in for brunch on Saturday morning and opted for the brunch specials which included an appetizer and entree. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich with fries and the hummus for my appetizer. We also got an order of Shisoto peppers and a burger. The food overall was average in my opinion. They used fresh ingredients with quality flavors however I didn't notice anything exceptional or different about these plates than most other places. The service was friendly and the wait time was not bad either. I guess I just had high hopes based on the reviews but in my opinion everything was average.
Best Thai food I had in a while. In love with their tom yum special they had...hoping it's still around the next time I go
Try for lunch, not for dinner. There is a spending minimum of $20/pp. Having frequented Cocoron in Lower Manhattan, Soba Totto did not live up to expectations. Came on a Saturday night and wait time for bar was 10 minutes. Not bad. However, service was impersonal. I can understand that for a busy lunch place, but for a $30 weekend dinner (soba + appetizers), we were hoping for a little more interaction. We were offered no guidance on the food and drink menus. Food arrived promptly. Yakitori was on point - wish we had ordered more skewers to share. Chef's special uni chawanmushi was porous and bland - not salty sweet and refined. Sukiyaki soba noodles were becoming soggy and dip was very sweet. It satisfied my cold weather noodle craving but did not impress me or leave me wanting to come back for more. My dining partner's cold soba tasted better (although forgot the name of his soba). Even though there were other seats open at the bar and no parties waiting at the door, we were rushed through our meal. Our table was cleared and check delivered promptly after we finished. Tea was no refilled. The interior of the restaurant was beautiful and it seems like a nice place for lunch according to other opinions (?), but I would reconsider for dinner.
"You wanna know how good this is? We poured ourselves into a SUPER hot Uber while HUNGOVER to drive here in time for brunch.  That is MOTIVATION, but the words ""French Toast and Fried Chicken"" were all we needed.  So, let's get right down to it.  The line looked crazy long, but we only waited about 25 minutes (enough time to go get an iced coffee and come back).  It looked like it was crazy tight inside, but it wasn't too bad once we sat down. I wanted EVERYTHING on the menu, but the three of us ended up getting shrimp and grits, the French Toast/Fried Chicken platter, and an order of hot Nashville's chicken. It was all amazing.  The french toast platter was also a great deal bc it came with grits and eggs.  The sauce on the shrimp and grits was insane.  But I think the Nashville chicken was the clear winner.  So crunchy, so moist, hot but not too hot.  It was amazing. AMAZING. I cannot wait to come back. The others got this bourbon and blueberry drink that they said was amazing.  I got a bloody mary, but I hated it (oh no!) but it's ok- I have been to several places  in Brooklyn lately that are making this sweet bloody mary, and I forget to ask before I order it bc I assume everyone wants theirs spicy and full of brine like I do.  But I couldn't even finish it, it was TOO sweet for a bloody mary.  EVEN SAYING THAT I am still giving them FIVE STARS.  I will be back soon. TOO soon probably. Thank GOD it's a bit of a poke from where we live."
A friend asked me to go out and grab a bite and i was up for it. He picked Peaches. This was my 1st time at the restaurant and he said he liked the food as a southern boy. Ok...my biggest mistake. The place needs to have a makeover. The restaurant was pretty empty and they have outdoor seating. We were seated pretty quickly I sat in the corner and I really wanted to leave as soon as i sat down. I felt like a lump of poo with the amount of flies flying around this place, not fruit flies either. I think there were more flies inside the restaurant then outside. One of the flies flew to his death and landed in front of me on my table. I plucked him off and went to the batchroom to wash my hands. Thats when I notice someone forgot to make sure they completely flushed everything down the toilet. So the ratings were going down by the minute. I arrived back to my table and noticed the pieces of carrots on the floor under my table. So im pretty much turned off. Did I eat? Unfortunately, I did, only to appease my friend. We ordered 2 glasses of reisling wine. They were brought out in scotch glasses because they ran out of wine glasses. I dont know how because the place wasnt crowded and there were several empty seats. I ordered the shrimp and grits. The shrimps were in a very creamy sauce that covered the grits making it look soupy. The shrimps were cooked perfectly and seasoned ok. The grits werent the best or the worst, but nothing to order again. I literally picked out and ate only the shrimp after a couple of bites. The side of garlic broccoli wasnt really garlicky and i ate about 3 floret and left it alone. Our 2nd round of reisling they found wine glasses. The reisling was more on the sweeter side. It tasted more like a moscato. I had the worst stomach ache by the time i got home. And lived on the toilet the next day. Overall, you guessed right. I wont be back, and dont recommend it to anyone.
Great lunch specials. Had Tom Yuma, green papaya salad (a little too much garlic) and Shrimp Padres Thai (a little too sweet). I ordered everything Medium spicy and that's exactly how it came out.  Excellent service and found a parking spot right in front.  I couldn't have asked for a better first experience here. I will be back!
I'd definitely recommend the squid starter for lunch and the chocolate cake on cake on cake FOR DESSERT !!!!! I'd expected more from the huevos rancheros but it was still good and my friend said the beef burger was delicious
first time having a poke bowl and it was delicous. saw this place on foodie instagrams and just had to give this place a try. i am not disappointed but its pricy though. they range from $13-$20 depending on the fish you want. they have salmon, tuna, and fluke. i asked the cashier which one was the most popular and she recommended the sichuan chili salmon. i said i dont eat spicy and she said she doesnt eat spicy as well and she really likes it, and that its not spicy. i couldnt agree more. i would go back on a day i want to splurge. you will NOT get full (at least not for me) from the regular size, not sure about the large size.  i hear they also have good ice cream but being that i was hot and in a rush, i didnt want to ruin my appetite eating ice cream before my meal. Oh, they have short operating hours, mon-sat 11-4
"Been wanting to try this place since I moved to NYC a couple of years now. Came here with my school fam and we ordered the beef brisket and tendon soups and dumplings. I wish they had a vegetarian option for those who don't eat pork. Regardless, my friends said they taste better than Vanessa's...I gave this place 4 stars because they mixed my order up...I got tendon instead of beef but my friends are nice :) and they gave me theirs haha. The noodles were really fresh and you could see them make it in this small hole in the wall place. It's really tight in there...so go when it's not ""rush"" time. We went on a Sunday evening around 8. There's very limited seating and they will push people out or move them around if they want to lol. Real cheap for the quantity of food. Cash only :P"
Really had high hope for this place based off all the great reviews but everything fell pretty short.  Came on Sunday for the restaurant week brunch.  We got biscuits to share, tomato salad for starters, chicken waffle sandwich, and banana pudding.  The bad experience all started since I have an allergy to mustard and both app items contained mustard.  The waiter suggested that I get the tomato salad and they can give me a different dressing on the side.  They first brought out the wrong app, then the tomato app but with the mustard dressing, and then finally after the third time they got it right. Then we were waiting quite a while for our drinks and were then later told that our ticket was lost.  Now onto the entrees, when it came it, they again brought out the wrong dish for me (we all ordered the chicken sandwhich).  Now the entree too was a bit disappointing.  The chicken was not crispy at all.  I thought it may have been the cheese that was melted on top, but even the pieces on the end were soggy :( The waffle was definitely more dense than I was expecting and not my favorite.  I will say the biscuits and the mac and cheese was pretty good, but not enough to make me come back.  In the end, the server was very very nice, but the service and the food just was not up to par.
"We went there for dinner with a group. Overall, this restaurant has the potential to be very good but needs some improvements. We asked for water for the table, and were brought a pitcher of tap water that still had foam on top. The waitress said and I quote, ""give it a few minutes to settle, it's from the sink"". That right there left a bad taste in my mouth and I hadn't even tried the food yet. Please get a filter and educate your wait staff to NEVER  bring out water like that out to a table again.  I also have to add that their $5 homemade lemonade is grossly overpriced.  Yes it's very good, but for a $5 wine glass of lemonade, there better be some rum or vodka in there to justify that price tag. We were served pita bread that was clearly not home made, lacked any flavor and was cold. Make the extra effort of either making some delicious flatbread or at the very least, warm up that store bought pita. It's important. Your bread will be used throughout the meal.  We ordered their sampler of dips which consisted of hummus, babaganoush, and 2 other dips. They were very good but the portion size of each dip was ridiculous. For $14, I expect more generous portions. The Fatoush salad and falafel were the hits of the evening. Both very flavorful, and perfectly seasoned.  Unfortunately, the rest of the meal was lackluster to say the least. We had to ask more than once for the pita to be replenished. Our pitcher of foamy tap water was never refilled. The service was not good. In fact, our server seemed to disappear into the kitchen constantly.  We ordered family style. The food arrived and we didn't even have plates. We had to wait for a few minutes while our waitress stumbled to get plates from an empty table behind us. Not professional. We ordered the lamb chops which were seasoned and cooked well. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the grilled meat platter. The meats lacked seasoning and were over cooked.  I won't even mention the desserts because not one person at out table enjoyed them. We ordered baklava and another I can't remember. There were only 2 available anyway. I write this review with the hope that the owner takes my criticism into serious consideration and makes the necessary improvements."
Pok Pok - tasty Thai food at the edge of Brooklyn, where courtesy goes to die. TL;DR - Food is tasty, portions are small so estimate 2 plates per person. Service requires a lot of patience. Expect to pay $50 pp including a beverage. Groups and dates are not advised. With a Michelin star and the neighborhood proximity, it was only a matter of time before I tried the much lauded Pok Pok in Cobble Hill. Situated on Columbia St on the edge of the water, its not convenient to most subways. Build in that expectation into your trip. (It's not the restaurant's fault where it is situated, however, if you have to wait a long time on top of the time it took to get here, it just makes the situation super grumpy reaaaaaal fast.)  Our group of six made a reservation for 7 pm. We updated the reservation to be for nine people a few days before, but the restaurant did not complain about the large party size. Everyone showed up on time for the reservation, to find that Pok Pok is so tiny, we couldn't stand inside the restaurant to wait. The hostess advised us to stand in the vestibule (not air conditioned) or go to the bar next door. We had actually come from the bar already (as some members in our group had half an hour to kill before the reservation time). We checked in with her at 7:20. Then 7:30, she said it would be five minutes more as the table was paying. Then finally at 7:45 and two more trips inside, we were finally seated. The hostess was curt and rude, rolling her eyes when we checked in on our wait, refusing to greet people or acknowledge customers when she was trying to accomplish things. I get that she's crammed in a tiny space, people are constantly asking her questions, and she has to be the multitasking queen of the universe - but the hostess sets the stage for the dining experience and she failed royally. Our waiter tried to smooth things over and apologized for the wait - and also, tactfully tried to remind us that the front of house issues didn't mean HIS service would suffer (which sounded like a reminder to not tip him poorly because we got started off on the wrong foot). That makes me feel like this happens a lot. Poor servers! Sounds like you all hate your jobs here! We got menus and I took down orders for our large party. I worked directly with the waiter (to minimize confusion) and made sure we got started quickly and avoid hangry backlash. We quickly received one plate after 10 minutes. Then drinks arrived 20 min after that. The bar is totally out of sync. Get it together - drinks are the money maker on your menu. Plates came sporadically, giving you time to finish a plate and savor it, before getting a brand new flavor. But that also means that you have a hard time gauging if you need to order more dishes and makes your meal stretch longer than necessary. We eventually ordered three more dishes on top of the original order and then had dessert. We left close to 10 pm, and a few people were not full. I had to flag down the waiter repeatedly as he was hustling between the back room and the patio. We also had to ask for water refills twice. The space is very tight and dim, so its hard for the staff to get around. Forget about bringing wheelchairs or strollers. We ordered: Fish sauce wings Muu paa kham waan - Spicy boar collar Kang hang leh - Stewed pork belly Neua naam tok - Flank steak salad Phan bung fair daeng - water spinach (ong choy) Mussel crepe (more like an omelette) Duck salad One sticky rice per person Mango sticky rice Thai iced teas Most dishes came spicy as the default. The boar collar had a bright green chili tang to it and came with a plate of iced greens (great idea!). The steak salad was also spicy yet refreshing. The ong choy and the duck salad are mildly spicy. If you can't take the heat, I wouldn't bother coming. So many dishes rely on chili that you may be limited to the mussel crepe, the curries, pork belly and dessert. In general, the dishes were a chaotic mix of spicy, sweet, sour, salty, and savory. Some lean more in one direction than another, but most dishes feature at least three of the five. My favorites were the fish sauce wings (not too salty, as one commenter said), the ong choy, and the pork belly. The boar collar had great flavor, but was not as tender as I expected. The flank steak was good but not memorable. The duck salad was hard to eat and featured minced duck rather than large pieces that were easy to share.  Due to the wait, the meal was sabotaged from the start. I'm sure the unique flavors of the food would have impressed more if we were not subjected to such a long wait and if we came in a smaller group. I cannot recommend Pok Pok for a date or important event because of the service, and while the food is noteworthy, its not worth going out of your way for.
Very nice. Walked right in with no reservation or wait on a Wednesday evening. The waiter was very attentive and food was delicious. The food earned five stars - deducted one star for experience. This is the sort of place where they expect you to spend plenty of money. We were on a business trip and were limited in what we could expense (and also simply weren't that hungry, having snacked that afternoon). After the waiter realized we wouldn't be ordering bottles of wine or multiple courses, it was obvious he was disappointed (even though, in the end, we tipped healthily). It lessens the experience overall if you feel too much pressure to (or worse, feel guilty for not) spend more money than you want. It's not like we walked in and ordered water and appetizers - but you would have thought it. He was kind, but never waivers in his attempts or recommendations (which, I understand, is his job) and couldn't completely hide his snobbery. I'd go back, but would try not to let it bother me next time.
I am offended by the frequent reminder of least amount restriction by the waiter. Let alone the legitimacy of a minimum restriction amount. First, it is an annoying experience to be reminded of this trivial issue all the time.  Second, the minimum amount does not match what is said on the website.  Third, it does not say anything about the exclusion of tax nor it says the take-out order does not count. I recommend people not going there for any meal.
I've had the poke bowl here once, with spicy salmon, salmon, kani, mushrooms, etc. The fish did not taste fresh at all, and it was actually difficult for me to even finish the fish after I've come to the realization. Aside from that, the rice and kani was good. They drizzle some spicy mayo over it, which always makes things taste better. Looks like I won't be getting a poke bowl from here anytime soon. I do love snow & cream though.
Menu is very limited--food is ok--portions are not large. Value is not great--over-hyped
Jacob's Pickles is probably one of my top 10 places I've ever ate at in my life so far.  This place can get busy so try to get here early and try to sit on outside on a nice day.  Came here for brunch and it did not disappoint.  Tried a Bloody BLT drink and it was very good and my wife got a mimosa, good too.  We were in the mood for fries and they come in a large bowl, easily enough for 3-4 people.  I got the sausage gravy smothered chicken southern biscuit sandwich, which is Amazing!  Everything about this sandwich is great so come here hungry.  The cheese grits are also good.  We also got the pancakes and fried chicken, which they hit out of the park on taste with this.  They do have a lot of good beer choices too if you are into craft beer.  It was a very lively place with great service.  If you're looking for a great brunch etc. make sure to try this place, they know good food.
Very cute location- clean and polished. But the food is far more greasier / more oily than most Korean food I've had, and I've had a lot. Well, all food wasn't too oily...the mandu looks way too dry so I decided to skip it. Shame about the food because the service was lovely and the place is nice. But food takes priority!
Super cool pizza spot. The overall place is HUGE. They have a Dinning area, patio area, and also a pick up/to go area. All which take up like a half of a block.  We came in on a gloomy Saturday afternoon. The place was fairly packed, however the Dinning room was super busy (30 min wait). The host did inform us we could go to the patio and order & pick up from the Togo space and eat in the patio. That was the best idea for a group our size, we were able to snag a bench for our big party in the patio, were they some old school hip hop playing, which always makes eating pizza in BK that much better. We didn't have to deal with a server, we were able to order our pizza, wait about 10-15 mins and then walk it back over and grub!!! The pizza was really good. Super fresh & quality ingredients were used (you can tell by the Taste). I can tell why this place is a hot spot for good pies.  We will definitely be back.
Another great option in the West Village for brunch! Like most spots in the area, the restaurant isn't very spacious but cozy enough for a meal with a small group of friends. The wait time was around 15-20 min for Saturday brunch so pretty standard affair. There's also a nice bar area to wait at. Once we were seated, we started with a round of cappuccinos, which were served in adorable stainless steel mugs! For our mains, my friend ordered the frittata while I had the baked eggs! The baked eggs, served with tomato hollandaise, and sprinkled with pancetta and spinach were delicious! The eggs were perfectly baked, and everything else was just so well flavored. My only complaint is that the toast underneath the egg was really soggy, but that's small enough that it can be easily overlooked.
I'll start with the food/cocktails. That's the most important after all, right? The food itself was pretty good. The pizzas we ordered were well put together, and the crusts were quite delicious. Absolutely would recommend them. The gnocchi was also delicious, but I would order without the hazelnuts.  Cocktails were strong, and the menu itself was full of bright and vibrant drinks. The atmosphere itself was where I struggled the most. Our server was adequate, but not overly personal nor very attentive. Definitely seemed most interested in turning tables. The music was on the loud side, making it tough to converse. And it was extremely humid, because as it was humid outside the restaurant decided to open all of the windows. I didn't find that to be overly pleasant. These things kept me away from a four star rating.
"This is one of the best pizzas I ate during my pizza pilgrimage to NYC.  For pizza enthusiasts, I would place this on the must visit list.   It's important to note that this pizza is NOT authentic pizza Napoletana, nor does it claim to be.  It's a neo neapolitan with many similarities to the original style, but an addition of non double zero flour into the dough and a flair for innovatively named and topped pizzas makes it uniquely different. I found the flavor development and texture of the crust to be better than most other NYC pizzerias offering neo-neapolitan or traditional neapolitan.  The pricing for the product seemed on the high end, but the service, atmosphere, and taste justified it in the end.  If the pizzas were only average, the atmosphere and ambiance still make it worth a visit, but the product makes it destination worthy for travelers or locals. Bright and well seasoned tomatoes on an excellently fermented dough with nice cheeses makes for some great pizza at Roberta's.  The high energy feel of the dining room is complemented by a ""rustic meets industrial meets hipster"" decor.  I come for the pizza but always enjoy an atmosphere as unique as the product.   One additional positive worth sharing.  I'm a pizza nerd and I love talking about pizza with people that share my passion.  Many times my questions and intrigue are mistaken for someone trying to steal trade secrets or passed off as some annoying customer that thinks he knows a thing or two.  I really appreciate when chefs and Pizzaiolo take the time to explain what makes their product unique or have a dialogue about their ingredients.  It's this openness that make us all better and continues to drive the pizza to new and undiscovered heights :) Thanks for taking the time to talk."
Such a cute place on the UES - warm and inviting and buzzing with people and conversations. Amazing burrata! Pappardelle al ragu was also great. Good wine. A bit cramped in terms of seating, but that's part of its charm. Service was prompt. Hope to visit again soon.
Me and my husband loves the food here. We've been here 3 times. Everything is seasoned very well. Pretty big portions which I like. Only disappointment is you can't make reservations and they don't have bottle water because I don't drink water from the tap or filtered water that still tastes like chlorine. American people are used to it but I still taste it because I'm from The Netherlands.
Roti canai  Asam laksa  Ginger duck egg noodles  Coconut curry chicken noodle dish  Satay, both chicken and beef,  My sister and I stopped in after our haircut. We've been coming to this place for years. Love their roti canai, light papery dough that you dip into their bomb curry sauce. The ginger duck noodle dish was a bit on the saltier end. Tried my sister's coconut curry chicken noodle dish and that was straight . Prices are so cheap for the portion and quality. Def recommend this place if you're craving endless options of Chinese/Malay food!
I ordered the skirt steak lollipop skewers (appetizer) and the Alcove burger with truffle fries. The sauce on the skewers were tangy and flavorful, I would definitely recommend. They serve you 4 skewers with three piece of steak on each skewer for $12. Quality of meat and sauce was excellent. The burger was juicy and the truffle fries were perfectly crisp. I shared the burger with one other person and the staff offered to split the order in half, which was very considerate. For a grand total of $34.60, the service was friendly, the food was high quality, and although slightly pricy, it was all worth it.
Chicken in a vegan dish, no clear way to order and get your meal. Messy inside, no order at all.  Poor experience overall.
Warning: DO NOT COME HERE DURING LUNCH. I've been here a few times for dinner, and the service was pretty stellar. However, I came back during lunch and got zero service. Nilch. Nada. Nothing. Crickets. We got our raw food..but they didn't come out with our hotpots with soup until 25mins later. Then we got our BBQ meats...and nobody showed up to cook it. I half expected tumbleweed to roll by.  One word: Trainwreck.
I came here on a Friday night on a double date. Key takeaways: outstanding martini and excellent menu!  Don't miss the Dirty Jane martini - their take on dirty martini with pickled tomato juice and garnish - absolutely delicious! The menu is varied and has several seafood options. The milk and cookies dessert was three huge chocolate chip cookies, just out of the oven, and served with milk + vanilla ice cream. The perfect way to finish off a delightful meal with great service. Perfect place for a date, girls dinner or entertaining visitors. Thanks, Jane, for a great evening!
Long wait, mediocre service and cold food served. Not what I expected, will I come back; probably not. I hate to feel like I'm constantly begging for assistance.
Stopped here because supertaste was closed.this is the absolute worse food i have ever had.pure slop.
As a Dumbo resident for the past 10 years, Almar has been my favorite restaurant in the area. They've always presented consistent well-seasoned food in a warm rustic environment.  Some of my favorite dishes include their steaks and fish. If you're craving some carbs, their pastas never disappoint.  Sadly, my family and I will be moving from the area soon. If we ever visit, I'll be sure to drop in to satisfy my dinner cravings and top off with an affogato!
I took my 90 year old great Aunt here this afternoon for lunch.  It was the first time I'd seen her in 15 years. Ambience was nice.  Service was terrible.  It wasn't busy at all, but took our two sandwiches nearly 45 minutes to come.  What really peeves me off is they charged me $3 for a soda, and then charged me $3 for a refill without ever saying they were going to charge me twice.  Food was boring and standard, and the dinner entrees looked way over priced.  Would avoid again.
Amazing! Came here for $1 fish taco night and was as good as I had heard! Can't wait to try the rest of the weekly specials.  Food so far is great! Price is just a bonus! ***** So I had originally given this place five stars after fish taco night... which is still legit.  The burger special on Tuesday is also good as is the oyster special on Sunday. I am indifferent to pork slider night.  I 'd recommend you skip fried chicken night (too much breading) and DO NOT do the fish and chip night.  As an advocate of Coopers, I have loved it since its opened- its close to where I live, and the food is good. So it is with a heavy heart that I say that the fish and chips here suck- possibly the worst I have every had- and I have had fish and chips on and airplane.  DON'T DO IT!
I just ordered the Katsudon. It was the worst katsudon I have ever had.  Whoever prepared this katsudon has not been trained properly.  Basically I got a bowl of rice covered by three pieces of onion, a couple scrambled eggs, I honestly did not taste any type of sauce, and a tough piece of katsu on top. Super disappointed..  I actually had the miso ramen once and I thought it was good.
This restaurant is a tourist trap. It's a 2 hour wait if you don't have reservations. Thank goodness the birthday boy had a reservation for 8 people. It's a family style Italian restaurant in Times Square. For appetizers we had the ceasar salad, mussels in garlic and wine sauce, and baked clams. Entrees we had the seafood linguini with clams, mussels, shrimps and scallops. Also chicken parm and the special of the night chicken that came with spinach and potatoes. Stuffed beyond belief. Come here with an empty stomach.
Beautiful, cool place to dazzle out-of-towners, and solid choice for a first date, as the place certainly looks impressive, and you'll be likely sitting alongside your date. Prices aren't cheap by any means, and for that price you can get a tastier bowl of ramen almost anywhere else in the city. Udon is not ramen, though: if you're expecting the same kind of rich broth and explosion of flavor, you'll be disappointed. We came here without a reservation during lunchtime on a Sunday. The place was definitely very busy, but the line moves quickly, and we barely had the time to order drinks at the bar that our table was ready. We tried the Tsurutontan Deluxe and the Oyako Don with chicken. First of all, the udon noodles are really good: thick and chewy, a real pleasure to eat. Moreover, most of the dishes come in huuuuge bowls the size of a small sink; as beautiful as they are impressive. The broth of both dishes was pretty mild; the tempura in the Tsurutontan Deluxe was good, and I certaily suggest to take it out of the bowl and put the various pieces on a side dish unless you like your tempura soggy. The chicken in both dishes was very bland, and in retrospect I would probably get the Okayo Don with salmon instead of chicken. Overall, outside the noodles, there was nothing particularly striking with these dishes. Service was good; attentive and fast despite the place being very busy.
"So after several years of having to hear, ""What?! You don't like Marea?!?  You MUST have just gone on an off night!"" I decided to give them another shot. That was a mistake I won't be making again.  Never again, Marea, never again. Frankly, this is now my example of just how off the Michelin guide can be.  How Del Posto can be 1 star while this is annually 2 stars is beyond comprehension.  Marea doesn't hold a candle to Del Posto. The food, the service, the ultra crowded seating... they all add up to a meal where honestly, if it cost 1/2 as much and didn't have the raised expectations of michelin stars, I still wouldn't go to often.   Oysters were fine but I've had better during happy hours... seafood risotto was bland as anything.  The lobster... oh the lobster was so boring I insisted that others at the table try it because I couldn't believe this place would plate such a dish. The affogato was good.  Well done, putting espresso and gelato together boys... well done. The service is on par with a neighborhood bistro... which is to say fine if you're spending 100 a couple, but no where near the prices they charge.   They naturally didn't have the wine we ordered either.  I can only imagine that they sold out of the wine just minutes before we ordered... or that the wine program is as sloppy as the food. Never again, Marea, never again.  You fooled me twice but I won't make it three times!"
"The pizza is not horrible but I'm confused with the price? We were excited to try New York's pizza since you always hear good things about it... but it was not worth to be honest. We waited 40 minutes on a weekday night which was fine. What disappointed me was the menu selection and prices. Over $20 for a small 12"" pizza that was nothing too special to me personally. I will admit that I appreciated the crispiness and how thin the pizza was. But just like any other Margherita pizza I've had it taste just like how its suppose to?  The small pizza will feed about 2 people maybe 3 if you're not too hungry. I saw customers around me who ordered a whole pizza for themselves. If you are cool with spending more than $20 on some basic pizza then this place would be great. Also this place is Cash Only. They do have an atm nearby but you will be charged $3. Additionally, the waiters weren't really attentive. We sat there for awhile before they even asked for our order. Idk I wished I liked this place but I guess my expectations weren't met."
Overall underwhelming and not a good value, but some positive points...or churros I mean.  Pros: 1. Chocolate churros! I would go just for those... Seriously delicious. 2. Water attendants were on it, it was hot and the food was salty so water was key and they were water ninjas! 3. Rice was tasty, maybe sugar or butter in it, not sure but good. Cons: 1. Overpriced, not any added value versus the other 3 Cuban restaurants in Hoboken. 2. Appetizers were tiny, empanadas were good but what deep fried food isn't good?  3. Churrasco is what everyone talked about but it was super fatty, ridiculous salty, and lacking in chimichurri (had to ask for extra). The beans were almost inedible they were so salty. 4. Server wasn't attentive, just going thru the motions. The water guy was nice and friendly and cared way more, bringing us sauces and going out of his way. Overall, I would just get chocolate churros and a drink after going somewhere else.
My friend and I were planning on going to UpThai for dinner last night, but once we saw the long wait we decided to try Thep instead. I am glad we did! Always great to try something new. We sat outside, which they have seating both on the avenue and the street which is something I appreciate. We split the chive pancakes, which were very different from what we expected. I loved them, my friend did not. Basically, they were shaped in these triangular prisms, instead of normal scallion-pancake shape. Crunchy outside with a gooey inside. I thought it was great! Then we split the cashew wok dish with vegetables and tofu. They charge an extra couple of dollars to have both. I thought this was really delicious.  The decor fits into that typical swanky thai decor that allows you to either dress up or down when you go. I was in gym clothes which was a little inappropro, but totally fine. They also have clear labels for GF and Vegan, which is something I always appreciate but especially at thai places where fish sauce seems to sneak into everything. Our total was $26 (one app and one entree). So IDK what the deal is with the boyfriend/girlfriend who also reviewed Thep and shared an app and entree and said there's cost double that. I will definitely be back to try some more things.
"I am an avid patron of Parkside. It's one of the few restaurant/cocktails bar in the neighborhood so I have been quite supportive from the beginning. My last two visits were less than stellar do to a manager who clearly doesn't understand hospitality. On both occasions, said manager of Guyanese ethnicity, was verbally rude and dismissive to me and my friends.  Each request was as simple as politely requesting the front doors be closed as it was a freezing spring night and the other was for a napkin/towel to help a lopsided barstool. Each time we were met with "" I can't help you"" or a plain ""No.""  Meanwhile, he sat literally next to us, idly reading a book and barely greeting new customers who came into the restaurant. Throughout the night we witnessed his grotesque behavior towards the staff. It's clearly commonplace that he is an awful person and manager. Not quite sure why someone like this would run a business when he lacks the acumen to provide  leadership and hospitality. As we know, in NYC, restaurants fail everyday due to such management styles.  I highly recommend never patronizing this restaurant. But if you decide to go, stop by Tuesday through Friday when the stellar Billy is mixing drinks and making sure all patrons drink well (defend the north and witch doctor with bourbon) and eat good (any pizza). He's warm and friendly and will make you feel right at home."
This place might be my favorite Malaysian restaurant, if only out of nostalgia (I've been coming here before Chinatown was ~hip~). With the area constantly gentrifying and new businesses popping up like weeds, it's nice to see that Nyonya has remained after all this time - and for good reason. After a poor experience at another restaurant where miscommunications with the hostess led to a 2 hour wait, I was really happy when the Nyonya hostess came outside to call numbers for those of us standing out front because the waiting area was full. It wasn't a huge deal but it still meant a lot. My friend and I waited about 20 minutes, which wasn't too bad for a busy Saturday night. It was a bit hard to get ahold of a server at times, and we had to ask more than once for water, but other than that it was fine. I wish I remembered the name of our server because he was so kind and cheerful. Roti canai, chow kueh teow, and pineapple fried rice are my go-to dishes. I'm pretty basic. The entree portions are a good size - more than I can finish in one sitting. Affordable and so so delicious. Don't ever change, Nyonya.
The boil isn't Boiling Crab (West Coast- best bagged seafood concept) but its pretty good. The line gets pretty long so try to get there a bit earlier. We got a pound of clams, shrimp & king crab combo, Cajun fries, soft shell crab, and wings. You can easily eat a pound of shrimp per person because it's so good. Oh, make sure you get a corn in one of the bags of seafood. Leave the corn in the bag to let it soak up all the spicy garlicky sauce. Then eat it at the end to finish your meal. The sauce is pretty delicious. I love peeling the seafood and dipping it back into the sauce to let it soak up all the flavor goodness. Overall the bagged seafood is pretty big and fresh. The apps are a bit smaller portion for what you're paying. The fries are a must though, so yummy. It is cash only!
The first word I said when I walked into this place was WOW.  The interior of the restaurant was covered in gold, gold draping, gold chandeliers, gold light fixture, you name it and it is coated in gold.  I freaking love it!  It was such an over-the-top display that makes you feel like you are in the grand dining room of a palace.  I have recently been to a number of new restaurants with minimalist modern decor, this place was a fun surprise.  I came here with a friend, but wish I came with a group of friends so that we can sit in one of the elaborately decorated booths in the front dining room.  We were seated in the small upstairs dining area, the seats were tight, especially since everyone had bulky coats with them.  However, it was nice to be tucked away in the smaller area without the hustle and bustle of the busy dining room downstairs. I never comment on menus themselves, but I have to describe the enormous menu presented to us.  It was leather bound and shaped like an old novel, absolute gorgeous.  We ordered a few dishes to share: Papaya Salad - A lot of restaurants just slap together shredded papayas with a huge amount of sugar and fish sauce.  That is not the case here, the papaya salad was perfectly seasoned and full of depth.  The spices formed a perfect harmony and the papaya had a nice texture.  It was a great appetizer to start the meal. Mieng Kum - I've never had this dish before and really wanted to try something new.  It was delicious!  The dish arrived as five bite sized leave wraps that sat atop five small glasses.  The presentation was beautiful!  I can't really describe this dish, except that it was the perfect little bite with different flavors (i.e. sweet, spicy and salty), and textures (crispiness of the coconuts, crunchiness from the peanuts and the delicateness of betel leaves).  I highly recommend you trying this dish if you never had it before.   Fried Half Duck with Red Curry - my favorite dish of the night!  The duck was fried to perfection with crispy skin and the curry was seasoned well with just a hint of spiciness.  The curry also contained string beans, Thai eggplants and other veggies, which was the perfect complement to the garlic rice. Braised Pork Belly - the least successful dish of the night.  The pork was tough and the flavor profile was lacking vis-a-vis the other dishes. Overall, we loved most of the dishes we tried and the entree portion was very generous, definitely meant to be shared family style!  The Thai ice tea came in a large mason jar and was aboslutely delcious.  Highly Recommend!!
The food here just wasn't good. The collard greens were not cooked, the chicken and biscuits were dry. The mac n cheese okay but $20 for lobster mac not worth it.
This is my routine of going into Chelsea Market as a local.  1 - Anthropologie 2 - Los Tacos No.1 3 - Wait in the forever long line for the Ladies Room  4 - GTFO because it starts to feel like Times Square with the mass of people. Bottom Line -  just order the adobada taco and thank baby Jesus. I don't even bother looking at the menu at this point.
Came here on a Friday night around 8:30pm. We were seated promptly. Ambience: Small and vibrant. Service: No complaints Food: We had the mushroom salad and  the asparagus wrapped in prosciutto, both yum. We had the Quattro Formaggio pizza and added pepperoni. The  pizza was good but the pepperoni was realllllly salty.  This was a cool place and if in the area I would return (and skip the pepperoni).
I'm so glad this place opened, I was waiting for their opening so long I forgot about them till I happened to be in Greenpoint and passing by recently. Noted and bookmarked for lunch later that day. I walk in and they're really just opening for the day, perfect I think to myself, I had a choice where I wanted to sit and didn't realize they had outdoor seating available to mid way through my lunch. (more on this later). Baoburg is very small and seating can get tight when at capacity, artfully decorated, serving cocktails and nice potential for a random night out with a friend or two for their outdoor dining area.  The Staff here and management you really need to pay attention to this, is bordering on can barely speak loud enough for the customer to understand, can barely understand a customer's inquiry and lacks good customer service / waitress skills.  1. I walk in and ask if Baoburg is serving Ramen Soup? Waitress Yes we are, what do you want? I would like to have a seat for starters. The girl behind the counter is talking to another staff member now and completely ignores me. 3 minutes later the same girl turns to me and asks again how can I help you? OK, I say can I be seated, oh you want to order she says. Come on already!!!!  So after this charade I'm seated wherever and wasn't advised that they had outside dining or giving the option. So staff and I were both clueless apparently. 2. I ordered a deliciously cold and refreshing Coconut Juice to start and could'nt find any Ramen Soup on the menu, so I called over the same lady and I say where's the Ramen soup on the menu, she says we don't have Ramen soup and I'm sitting there trying to figure out where the breakdown in communication came in at. OK, so I decide to order the Seared Duck Breast Noodles which was the closest I could get to what I came in there for. 3. The Servers are not only complete clue birds but they're also rude and got a bit too pushy at the end of the meal. They appeared anxious to clear my table and I understand the need to seat as many people as possible, but it was off-putting after being asked twice if I was done with my meal, which I was not but clearly they wanted me out of my seat as quick as possible so the next 3 minutes went by and the waitstaff came back to my table this time with my check in hand and her hand outreached to remove the bowl. Come on already, Baoburg seems to want to offer a chill environment but having cluebird waitstaff on hand that chases out the customers before they can finish swallowing their meal is an absolute disgrace and really set me against coming back here. What I ordered - see below   * Seared Duck Breast Noodles - 4.5 This was a small dish for the asking Price of $12 and the broth you see in the bowl (photo here -  ) tasted a tad too sugary and salty however the overall dish was very good. * Pork Bao Buns - 2.5 stars - photo here -   & here -  I was surprised with this order - for some reason the pork came stewed down in a thick sugary salty type of gravy base along with two super fresh steamed buns and some fresh veggies that you had to put together yourself wasn't bad but I got nervous thinking about the the level of MSG that might be in this small appetizer and wasn't good enough for me to reorder again. I left Baoburg not feeling that great because of the high levels of sodium / sugar content in such small servings and very annoyed that I spent my money here after being rushed out of the door by cluebird's.
This is, by far, the best Greek food in NY. It is also very affordably priced. The fish is extremely fresh - I've seen it coming in myself as I live in the neighborhood.  This is a favorite lunch spot for my girlfriends and me.  You will NOT get octopus like theirs ANYWHERE else. Trust me, I've tried. It's become a fun little competition for every restaurant I go to. No one compares. Not milos, not Limani, literally no one.  Other outstanding menu highlights include lemon potatoes, romaine salad, saganaki (fried cheese), and the Greek style shrimp.  The best part? Most of what you order is actually healthy. The service is lightning fast, accurate, and amazing. And the waiters are not too hard on the eyes. Lol.
"TIP: CASH ONLY and AMEX ONLY!  The only reason why I chose to eat at this restaurant is because of Google. I looked up ""best restaurant in Chinatown"" and this made it to the list. Despite the average Yelp rating, we still decided to eat here. My overall experience was average. To be honest I've had much better dim sum in other places.  We ordered pork and shrimp dumplings, pork sticky rice, shrimp rice roll, fried shrimp balls, and stuffed eggplants. I also ordered a side of rice, but we ended up not finishing it. The sticky rice wasn't very sticky, and some parts were hard. I like the shrimp stuffed eggplants the most. Everything else was just average.  The service was exceptional! They have enough workers and they were all pretty nice. I accidentally dropped my napkin on the floor and one of the waiters immediately for me a new one."
"I would definitely say this place is hyped and overrated. Service is standard and food is also standard. The staff is attentive but they're not the happiest bunch. My friend and I went all out with drinks, appetizers, entrees, desserts, etc, but they proceeded to give us the check when we didn't ask for it. We completely understand when the restaurant is crowded and they need to clear out tables, but it was only 6:00 on a weekday night with only two tables besides us. Rather off putting; it basically tells customers ""Hey, you're done eating and you've been here a little over an hour which is too long so please get out."" Food is decent, but not awesome and memorable. We can eat a better, hearty meal at Ayada for the same price and for the same service."
Loved it!!! The arugula salad, seafood pasta, and vodka pizza were all exceptional. The wait was less that what we were told, and the place was fun, service was great and the food was amazing.
Wedge salad was delicious, but the pizza was disappointing -- bland sauce, soggy base w/tough perimeter crust, and no flavour toppings.
Last night we had the opportunity to have probably the worst dinner one can have in NYC. Dry focaccia is served with weird sweet butter.  Meatballs in tomato sauce is ok. Served with cheap soaked in oil grilled hero.  Butternut squash ravioli was a form of a torture. Uncooked disgusting ravioli topped with unrecognizable sauce that tasted like a fermented jagermeister with some bland salad on top. Duck 2 ways dish was the star of the night- dry and old confit on top of weird coffee infused duck breast that was completely raw and rubbery. Scotched farro with sweet potato purée took this dish to a new low. For dessert high price tag, and pretentious cold service.
"*In my Fire Marshall Bill voice* ""Let me tell ya something!!* I really reallly heart their burgers...and this from someone who has never cared too much for meat! The bun was soft and tasted like it was lightly buttered, the burger was juicy and just perfect. My husband introduced me to this place when I was in NY for a few days and I could see that he was a regular. I really like how they treat him and now us for the matter. Very welcoming and like we are family. They know his name and occupation and always have a quick but friendly chat. This goes for whomever takes the food orders but whoever is at the bar, they still treat us nicely. I can see that there's a cute little area to sit outside when the weather is right for that type of thing. And I have to say, that the music adds the right touch--not too loud or too soft--and it's pretty good songs. It looks like they have another "" regular "" customer in me lol, they definitely earned it!"
I always come here for the zha jiang mian noodles when I'm craving Asian flavors from home.  $12 gets you a medium sized bowl filled 80% with noodles, and the rest with sauce. Quite steep for noodles, especially for the portion, which would be hard to make into two meals even for a small girl like me that stops eating when I'm not longer hungry, but it is midtown. This particular dish is a little different compared to what I'm used to having, which is the Taiwanese style, but it's still good! It almost has a hint of korean style flavors to it. When you're done, you'll be greeted, unfortunately, by a pool of oil at the bottom of the bowl.  This location is pretty small with a front and back kitchen, called kitchen A and B. It gets a little confusing sometimes if you don't listen carefully which kitchen to get your order from. The back room has a couple tables here and there, though it's a little cramped - definitely not a place to enjoy your meal if you're 6 feet. Thankfully, Bryant park and my school is just nearby and I can take it to go. Be careful about making sure that you got what you ordered! Once I asked for nonspicy only to get back to school and learn that it had chili oil. I can't handle my space well and this oil in particular was incredibly spicy for me. It was hard to finish.
"This place is one of those dreaded CASH ONLY spots!!! No mention of this on their website or menu or when you walk in the door. You get a wooden cup with your bill at the end of your meal that has CASH ONLY written on it. Like really??  Uber annoying when you have a $200+ bill!!!  Let's stop trying to stiff the IRS and take one of the major cc brands for payment for the love of everything holy! Plus if you're going to charge me to take money out of your ""conveniently"" located atm machines, at least drop the fee to one of those .99¢ charging ones or something.  But that's really the only negative about this place, thankfully. Hands down the broth for their signature mu ramen is rich, deep, rib sticking and soothingly good. It was a nice welcome on a chilly rainy evening. Reminded me of some of the best ramen broths I've experienced in Japan.  The U&I was executed perfectly with the perfect balanced amounts of wasabi, sushi rice, uni, ikura, and magaro. Every bite had a little bit of everything. The foie gras stuffed chicken wing was interesting. Great crunch and seasoning of the skin and breading but because the velvet texture of the foie gras, for a second there I thought I had bit into undercooked chicken, though that wasn't the case. The foie gras against the chicken meat had a bit of a rubbery texture much like undercooked chicken. But getting past that mouth feel, it was delicious. Their short rib sammie served with kimchi as the veg accompaniment was cooked to a perfect medium rare. So tender and full of flavor.  Tables seemed to be cleaned and turned over very quickly so the wait wasn't bad. Could use a bit more air flow or AC, it got real stuffy and warm very quickly."
Bad, tasteless pizza given to you with an attitude.  Their workers look so unhappy working here. I cannot, for the life of me, understand some of the high ratings.  My only guess is that a majority aren't native New Yorkers and that this pizza is somehow better than the pizza of their youth in Bumfluck, Nebraska.   To me, it's even worse than store-bought, frozen pizza.  The pizza at Joe's has a flavorless, thin sauce, that tastes a little off or stale and slightly sweet (sweet sauce on pizza is a no-no). Like old water sprinkled with some sugar. The cheese is sparse and also flavorless. In short, they've gone on the cheap with their ingredients.  Very poor quality. The dough also has a slightly sour taste.  In other words, the entire pizza sucks.  The Sicilian?  Even worse if you can believe that. You'd get more flavor drinking water from the fire hydrant around the corner.  Finally, this place is filthy. Even the exterior needs a good scrubbing.  Take a look around if you decide to come here.  In short, Joe's (including the owner) should be ashamed to sell such crap in NYC.  Sucker born every minute? Zero stars.  Had to give 1.
Good food, not great.  ok service.  the chianti was dull, the Italian bread was stale, dry and very cheap.  they can find a bakery nearby to offer better breads.  baked clams v.good, veal florentine average, and the risotto funghi undercooked and slightly hard.  Too much competition nearby to tolerate overpriced, average entrees.  Not worth a repeat visit.
This place was AWESOME. Highly recommend if you're in town near Little Italy. Great place for dinner if you want a pleasant filling pasta and pizza with cheese that melts in your tongue. They really couldn't have made the margherita pizza better. The venue is on the dark side and can be crammed, but it's perfect when you want to feel cozy and warm inside.
Park Ave Tavern was a pleasant surprise in an area not known for great restaurants. The food isn't amazing or particularly memorable, but it is solid and the space is very cozy. Service wasn't great as they kind of forgot about us for a while and had to be asked to come back, but in general were pretty helpful and friendly. The beer selection is decent, but not exceptional on the craft beer selection. Still, the inclusion of Prohibition Ale is a nice touch. The menu is mostly pub fare with a few interesting twists like a spicy lamb burger. The lamb was delicious, especially with the creamy goat cheese and pretty mild peppers. The room in the back is also very nice to relax in and have a quiet meal.
No ma'am, no sir. I'm not West Indian, but I've lived in Brooklyn long enough to know good West Indian food.  Sorry, but this isn't it.  I ordered oxtail stew, and my dining companion ordered curried goat. He remarked, quite appropriately I might add, that the food would have been a bit better had it not been listed as curried goat. Harvest Stew? Yes. Curried goat?  Nope. Saying the food was underseasoned is an understatement. I asked the waitress for hot sauce (in a WEST INDIAN restaurant), and she directed me to a bottle of jerk sauce on the table. Listen, that jerk sauce tasted like vinegar mixed quarter teaspoon of jerk seasoning. Anyone who eats oxtails know they are work, and the flavor simply was't worth it.  The best part of the meal was the coconut ice cream.
Super disappointed. This place was rated with four stars so I decided to try it, but honestly not sure why it got four stars. The tacos were mediocre- under-seasoned. The drinks were flavorless, really watered down and over priced. Definitely won't be coming back.
This place is so fun. We sat at the bar and the bartender was great! I don't totally understand the ordering approach because it looked like you were supposed to mark on the menu what you wanted to order but there was no way to designate between what you wanted on each meatball. We just told the server what we wanted and it worked out just fine. We had the original, the Chicken and the Special that happened to be a mac and cheese meatball. it was so good!   There is quite a wait or at least when we went there was so be prepared but there seems to be plenty to do around there to kill the time.
【review from a Chinese】So everyone, Please please look at here!!!! As a Chinese I would say,,, the food here is terrible! I mean, of course a lot of you may enjoy it since the reputation and ranking won't be such high for no reason. But as a real Chinese(well you can tell from my terrible grammar lol) who has been 'spoiled' by REAL Chinese food, I didn't enjoy it at all! I would love to be fair and objective so I only comment on the dishes I tried.  1. Soup dumpling小笼包: well I feel that the dumplings are too big for the name 'Xiao long bao'. Of course you may feel happy since you get enough amount of food for your money. But in China, soup dumplings are always t hat kind of 'delicate' or 'luxury' thing because they are supposed to be very small and the skins should be very thin. I feel that the soup dumpings there were like pork bums with soup inside lol. 2. Fried rice The rice is so sticky and the taste is very ... average. I would say if the fried rice that I cook is like that, I won't be confident enough to ask my Chinese friends to try it lol. I feel that for fried rice, the rice should be more loose.. I mean, you feel every grain of it and the grains should be smaller. 3. Beef noodle soup Well this one is so so average or below average. It's just like one of the wierd instant meals that are served on the flight. The noodle was way to thick and the soup was tasteless.  Overall, if you enjoy the food there then good for you. But let's not say that's Chinese food. If the restaurant were in China, it won't be that famous at all. Even some small restaurants on the street are better than it.  Also, it's not Shanghai food either! It even doesn't have 生煎 and 咸肉菜饭 and 红烧排骨 and a lot of other typical Shanghai dishes！
My best friends planned my birthday dinner here for a large group of 20+ guests.  pros:  - we occupied the entire room to the left and were able to enjoy a semi-private dinner.  - very roomy and comfortable dining. atmosphere, ambience and decor was very cozy and romantic. loved the tall ceilings, exposed brick and candlelight.  - we chose the family style menu (which was reasonably priced) and there was definitely more than enough food to go around.  - some of the items on our menu were hit or miss but for the most part, majority was tasty and well prepared.  - their speciality cocktails were actually very good. the Glass Slipper was my favorite.   cons:  - our waiters while professional, were somewhat dry and robotic.  - the dishes could have came out somewhat faster. the major disappointment however, was that we were never informed the backyard garden closes before midnight. the host agreed to keep an area reserved for us in the nice outdoor lounge/cabana area for our after-party where we also invited additional friends to meet us for drinks. suffice it to say, it really really put a damper on the entire evening while myself and 15 other friends are walking around williamsburg at midnight looking for a place to have drinks...  MAJOR FAIL, MY MOON!
A friend of mine who use to live in NYC recommended Freemans for brunch/lunch because of how unique the location is. So I was on the hunt for Freemans, she mentioned that its hidden down an alley and I wouldn't have spotted it if I didn't know about it. Freemans is a neat spot in the lower east side down near China town and SOHO down an unusual alley with art work. Nat and I were on a bit of a hunt, google maps was being weird so we got a little lost but were in the general area. We took a turn and saw a outdoor sign that had a brunch special and arrow - there was Freemans!!  There is a bunch of unique art work and a baby blue door which is the entrance. We walked in and you have to walk through some curtains before you are greeted. We were seated right up front near the entrance and a two table top and handed menus. I looked around and it was dimmed lighting so I couldn't see much. I went with the scrambled eggs with roasted potatoes and I chose sausage links. Nat went with the steak & eggs sandwich which came with potato salad and we shared an order of beer-battered onion rings. I was pretty excited for the food to arrive because of the recommendation and reviews. When it did arrive, I was excited to see a full plate! I started to eat my meal and noticed that it was really greasy and bland tasting. The eggs were a little on the dry side, the potatoes weren't crispy at all and when I had some potatoes it left grease marks on the plate. The sausage was nothing special....needless to say, I was super dissatisfied. Nat's sandwich came with lettuce, cheddar cheese, spicy mayo, shredded beef with scrambled eggs and the side of potato salad. She noticed right away that it wasn't your classic 'steak' but shredded pieces of beef. It would have been nice to have the option of how she wanted her eggs done but otherwise, she enjoyed her sandwich. The potato salad on the other hand was....odd tasting. It was almost gritty and was super bland. The potatoes had no texture and were way too soft. They need some kind of crunch in the salad and something for flavor, we didn't finish the potato salad. Now for the onion rings, they were HUGE! There was four rings and they were lightly battered with a  nice crispiness. They didn't have much flavor either but they are just onion rings after all. It was neat to see them that big but for pretty much $2 a piece, it wasn't worth it. Our server was kind of attentive, he filled our waters but we had to ask a couple times. The food wasn't good - it was actually a huge disappointment for us. I had my eye on the turkey sandwich at first but changed it to a classic brunch last minute. Full of regrets!!!!!! They say their food is American style...simple, rustic and inspired by old world traditions. I get it but it was way too simple and did they not have any flavor in the old world?!  Neat location but that's about it. *sigh*
The cocktails are pretty good. The food came put surprisingly quick, you're going to get your food fast if your hungry. I got the green pasta since it seems to be all the rage, but it could use a tiny dash of salt, other than that, great place, great ambiance. I enjoyed the vodka more than tequila, but that's personal preference. Try it out and you won't be disappointed!  Not too busy, plenary of space at the bar and the bartenders are pretty great!
A bit pricey, but a lovely hidden treat! I usually come with another person and start off with the flatbread. So far my favorite are the rabbit tacos and I love the lamb! I've also had a few of their vegetarian dishes as well and love the complex flavor profile each dish has. We usually order either two big dishes and or a big dish and medium one depending on the selection. My favorite dessert is the chocolate pudding that is paired with an olive cookie! I highly recommend this place and the price is well worth it!
Food was good for what it was, but service was atrocious. Friends and I did not get our food until an hour after we had ordered, which was unacceptable given that our orders were not that complicated: three orders, all of which were some version of knife cut pan fried noodles. One of my friends went to a lady to ask, and all she did was shrug without giving him a direct response. He went to someone else afterward and they said that everyone else in the restaurant was waiting, which was a complete lie since every other table seemed to be enjoying their meal. They didn't bring us the tea that we had requested for about 30-45 minutes. They likely forgot about us because we sat in the basement area. We probably could have gotten our food faster if we had decided to wait for a seat in the main seating area or gotten our food to go. The last straw was when we were supposed to get $15 change, and the cashier only gave my friend $5. Mistakes happen, but she was not apologetic by any means when we called her out on it. Would recommend this place for takeout only... And make sure they give you back correct change.
Stopped by for dinner tonight. The atmosphere was nice. The staff was friendly but not extremely attentive regarding drink reorders. The food was decent. Nothing to write home about but fine. The menu descriptions were better than the actual food, IMO. My big disappointment was the spicy margarita. I got the Toronja which is supposedly made with habañero & is very spicy. My wife got a mango margarita with jalapeño. Neither were spicy enough to even raise an eyebrow at. Just the slightest hint of heat but nothing near the description on the menu. The standard house marg was fine. But after 3 of them I wasn't the slightest bit buzzed.
Hostess is very rude.  It is a shame because their food isn't bad, but the unwelcoming atmosphere spoils my appetite.  I wish they would change the attitude.
My friends have been hyping this up for years, so I finally just had a chicken tikka roll.......and hated it. My first impression was that it was too salty, followed by a realization that a couple chunks of chicken were still pink inside. It just didn't have a satisfying taste to it at all. I expected the green chutney to be poppin, but it wasn't. I was super disappointed. And their white sauce is just.....odd. It doesn't taste like regular white sauce that I've had at similar joints. I hate to say this and I never thought I would, but I think I might like the kati rolls in New Brunswick better (which is not saying much, because they have a two-star rating). If I had to choose, I'd sadly choose that one instead. Update: Had the aloo masala roll with green chutney, and honestly it wasn't much better. I should have known better than to come back.
The food is nasty. Non seasoned meatballs with a whole lotta sauce poured over them. It was one of the worst thing I ever ate. Bland and tasteless. But the ricotta asparagus is okay nothing to brag about. Definitely will not be coming back here.. and oh that grape fool aid taste just like Koop aid with a splash of rum..
First, it's beautiful. Every last charming detail, especially the round vintage lights with their nod to the building's history. Our service was excellent - helpful, respectful and they were around just enough. The food was delicious, delicate and inventive. Our server was very helpful in pulling together the just right concert of dishes and, despite not being a bread fan, I'm so happy that at her recommendation that we tried the flatbread. Even if a bit too pricey, it was superb. (though its really a bit too pricey) I had the chicken and my friend the lamb. Both had spectacular flavor and were cooked to perfection. The broths were out of this world and the chicken was the most tender and flavorful I've had in a long while. There may have been a few too many onions proportionately in both of our dishes and despite the fact that they had nice flavor, the amount of them left us feeling as though they were filler. And it wasn't a small serving - it actually felt just right. We also had the tomatoes with Bulgarian feta and the cauliflower. Both were top notch. Our only complaint - We were enticed by the interesting cocktail and wine menus, but when they arrived, while both beautiful and delicious, they were very small, just sips each. I wonder if restaurants know what an impression this leaves. There are places we don't go back to based on this alone. I for one would much rather spend a couple extra dollars and have a real drink. We stopped ordering more out of resentment, not because we'd had enough. In the end, we would most definitely return, which - given what I said about the drinks, says a lot about the food. (Though we hope they heed our thoughts on the drinks, as it might not be as often if they don't)
"We ate there on Saturday night and it was fantastic!  I went back Friday, and had a very different experience.  We ordered an appetizer and it was out in 5 minutes and it was delicious. We finished it at 6:00. I started to notice people who came long after us were eating already. The waiter saw me looking around and came over and said "" your food will be out in 2 minutes"" 15 minutes later, at 6:50, customers had come, eaten,and left, and we still didn't have our main course.2 Gyros and one Souvlaki- which shouldn't be a big deal in a Greek restaurant. I called the waiter over and asked for the check. He told me the food was coming out ""right away"" I told him I didn't want it. They did not charge me for the ONE appetizer we ordered. I wasted an hour and 15 minutes on a Friday night and wound up going home and ordering a pizza. I am hugely disappointed, great one day, infuriating 6 days later."
Taste so bad. I ordered steak bowl and steak tastes burnt. And my bf ordered a chicken udon soup, and the soup tastes burnt meat as well
The world famous Joe's Shanghai in Chinatown does an incredible job of xiao long bao Shanghainese dumplings and hundreds of other Chinese dishes. Done well and done expertly. We had about four orders of the dumplings but also a great chicken fried rice, fried noodles, sesame chicken and also general Tso's chicken along with a few other assorted dishes. Beef and green beans was an absolute stand out as well. This place is chaotic, but go in and get a number and they'll call you for your table - you may wind up sitting at a communal table but definitely worth it.
Came here to eat after watching a show on broadway.  I have to say I was disappointed with my dining experience.  I used to frequent this place when I lived in the city from 2007-2010.  Maybe it is just that I have enjoyed fine yakitori, most notably at Nanbakan in LA.  But yes, this place really disappointed me.  When I ordered, they did not have any white rice so they could not make me a donburi.  That was really disappointed.  I am not sure how a Japanese restaurant runs out of white rice... I ordered a few yakitori, the standard like liver, chicken thigh, couple of veggies and I opted for the lamb instead of steak.  Boy, was that a mistake.  The lamb had a real gamey flavor, did not taste fresh at all.  I was really disappointed with my dining experience.  I might go back if I was sure they would have rice available and stick to the standard fare.  Don't order anything fancy or expensive at this establishment.  Their items are not super fresh so no need to overpay while expecting quality you probably will not get.
Food was ok. We found very thing bland and lacking flavor. We didn't even offer fish sauce? That's ridiculous.  Here's wat we ordered : Special Pho: We like the pho. It has a light broth and  not heavy on salt. Just the way I like it. Potion was big also. Me and my husband shared and was good.  Summer roll: was ok. Didnt like the picked turnip and carrot in it. The peanut sauce was bland. Where's the fidh sauce? Pork chop banh mi: was ok. Pork chop has no flavor.  Overall it was worth a try but being asian we had better Vietnamese food locally.
I expected this place to be overrated but it was really quite good, especially at the price range. I enjoyed the beef tartare which was actually quite delicate. I also had the black bass which was very flavorful. I only wish that it came with slightly more fish, but I was still full when I left. For the wine I had a Loire valley sparkling white which was a good compromise for champagne.  The service was expert. Even with the device included in the price, our waitstaff was attentive and professional.  I hope to return soon.
"This 2 stars is NOT for the food. The food is solid and the tempura is probably the best I've had. Food is awesome, lunch box special is a great deal. FOOD GETS SOLID 5 STARS. The service is what prompted me to write this review. I went for lunch and when the bill came, I paid and tipped 15%. A few minutes later, one of the employees came up to me and said ""was the service okay?"", and then went away. And then a minute later, the same person came up again and said ""an 18% tip is required"", pointing to the portion of the receipt that said ""Suggested Gratuity"". It was a $1 difference, so that's not what bothered me. The issue was that I was told I was REQUIRED to give a certain amount of gratuity. I paid the difference because a dollar wasn't worth the argument, so I guess here I am on Yelp expressing my discontentment about it instead.  So yeah, the service was fine until I was confronted about having to pay a required amount for tip. I have never been told that before, and having been a waitress myself, think that is kinda rude and weird to be demanding a certain amount of tips from a customer."
My boyfriend and I were walking around in the area and decided to come in for dinner. We didn't have alcohol, so only rating their food. The food was really disappointing. Although the presentation was beautiful, everything was undersalted and sorely lacked flavor. The patatas bravas were the best dish we ate -- the dishes with ham barely had ham and just tasted fried. There are much better tapas places in the area.
I heard so many lovely things about this place and I was truly disappointed with my experience. When I got there it was a wait I was told there was one more person ahead of me but the host sat 4 tables after I arrived. Since my shift started in 20 Minutes and I was being looked over I thought I could order to go. I asked a server  if I could look at the menu and the hostess who wouldn't allow me sit came behind her and said I couldn't order to go Bc brunch time is really busy. I'm so disappointed and I guess I have to try another place the next time my shift is in Williamsburg
This is the best brunch menu I've had in forever. Celebrated my birthday brunch here and it was super awesome. Everything was spot on, from the cozy rustic ambience, to the seamless service and to the really amazing food for which we just had to compliment the chef. Definitely would recommend this to everyone to try out their menu :)
The Happy Hour wine flights alone would keep me coming back to this place, but the escargot was, without question or doubt, the BEST escargot I have ever had, and that includes France. It can get crowded, so make a reservation if you can, but they have a very roomy bar that is actually better than some of their tables near the front, so snag those seats if you see them open. Very attentive staff that were very knowledgeable and helpful with the wines and never let our water glasses get empty. All around a great find!
"I really am falling in love with Sunnyside. Moved to the neighborhood a few months ago, and it's the perfect mix of old-school/new-school without the teensiest whiff of pretension. The Alcove really does lend to that feel in a huge way.  The Alcove is definitely ""up there,"" right on the border of Woodside. But likely no more than a 10-15 minute walk from most Sunnyside abodes. Even if your trip will be on the longer side, it's worth the trek.  This place is a smaller spot, the larger tables seat a max of four, with additional seating at the bar for eats and drinks. The options definitely lean toward comfort-food-y, but they don't leave you feeling overly greasy or gluttonous. It strikes a perfect balance.  Three visits down the hatch so far, and I've enjoyed a small sample of their offerings. The Alcove Burger is savory/sweet and all-too satisfying. Their Cuban Sandwich IS HONESTLY ONE OF THE BEST I'VE HAD IN THIS CITY (I was raised in the Bronx, and yes, I'm including all the Caridads and PR/DR/Cuban Restaurants I've frequented over the years). And those truffle fries, tho...  Oh, and grab the Patacones as an appetizer for your table. Rock-paper-scissors for the last chunk of pork may be required. Or a fight to the death.  The beer selection is solid - they can set you up with a flight of revolving, local (and local-ish) taps, so you get a bit of everything. (Think: LIC Beer Project, Other Half, Rockaway Brewing Co., etc). They get some fancy-pants, limited release export beers in on occasion too, along with a pretty sizable collection of bottles and cans. Full bar for the liquor&cocktail-fiends, yes. But my beer snobbery was thoroughly satisfied.  Guys, this place fills up around the typical dinner times, especially on Fridays & Saturdays. If you'd like the experience without the crowd, I'd recommend dropping by on a random Monday or Tuesday night (before 8pm, if you can manage it). Otherwise, be prepared to grab a drink and hang out while you're waiting for a table. Not too much standing room inside, but they set up benches outside as a failsafe.  The wait-staff and bartenders are all absolute sweethearts, and treat every table like they're visitors in their home. I'm so happy that The Alcove is a thing that exists. Please do give these guys a visit!"
"I have no explanation for why this place has 4.5 stars on Yelp. All I can't think of is that the ratings are significantly skewed because of the lack of quality bars and/or gastropub fare in Staten? I will trust Staten reviews for pizza or Italian food in a heartbeat but I've learned my lesson on anything else. There is also a challenge of separating out what patrons are reviewing when it comes to a ""gastropub"" - the food? the bar? both?  Walking into this bar/grill made me feel like I stepped into a bar off a random road in Nebraska. I didn't recognize the crowd and could't place the feel of the bar at all - this is not necessarily a bad thing, its just an observation. I rather go somewhere where I don't know the crowd in Staten! It looks like they support local artists, as there was a lot of metal work pieces on the walls, all that seemed to be for sale. I thought this was pretty cool, though none of it was my style. As a bar, it seems like this place could be OK. There was a sizable offering of beers on tap and bottle, ciders as well. Cocktails are clearly not what they are known for or interested in making - they were about $14 each. I barely pay that much for a drink in the city so, no. I did not have a drink since we were actually just there for food.  So, the food. I want to preface that neither of us ordered any of the BBQ offerings and its very possible that these are actually the gems of this place. I ordered the fried chicken (requested all white meat, extra $2 which is the norm) and a side of mac and cheese. The chicken was extremely lightly breaded and not too oily which I appreciated but it was also extremely dry/overcooked. Luckily I love all types of fried chicken - even bad - so I wasn't totally mad about this. But I would say this was the equivalent of ordering it from 494-Chicken or some other 2nd rate KFC. Not worth however much it was. The mac and cheese was pretty bad, bland and mushy. Literally would have rather had a box of Velveeta. Such a bummer. My dining partner ordered the blue cheese burger with bacon and I think a type of BBQ sauce with the seasoned fries. In thinking back the waitress did not ask him how he wanted it cooked which I feel is pretty standard so that was weird. He said his burger was pretty good, but basic. The fries were just okay too. He did say that BBQ sauces on the table tasted really good which goes back to my comment on the fact that the BBQ food might be the winners at this joint.  I'm really glad to see a place like this on Staten, especially in the neighborhood/section of Van Duzer its in. But I think if Staten wants to be taken seriously as an actual borough of NY, its going to need to step up its game when it comes to bars, pubs, gastropubs, etc. Solid place for a drink and maybe some BBQ, but I won't be returning. Wish it luck, though!"
Great space. Attentive service. Swell cocktails. Food was Ok. Had rice cakes, fava beans, shaved eel, smoked carp, and 1000 yr. old eggs.  The favas and carp were the highlights.  Both rich with flavors unique to me. Eggs were average, the rice cakes were dull, and the eel dish was light on eel. Good portions reasonably priced.
I came here on a Thursday night for dinner with a friend. I arrived early so I was able to indulge in their happy hour specials, which were well drinks, beer and wine. I ordered a G&T and I got my friend a Malbec. I later ordered a No Name - a delicious pineapple tequila drink and a Hell's Hundred - a not-so-good bourbon cocktail. The ambiance is quite chic with the dim lighting makes a nice place for a romantic evening. My friend and I ordered a Warm Brownie as our antipasti because dessert should always go first. I then ordered the Veal Milanese based on my servers suggestion. I found the Milanese to be okay - would I order it again? Probably not. However, the brownie was delicious. Recommendations: For a Drink, try the No Name For a Dessert, try the Warm Brownie Cons: Veal Milanese (apparently one of their better dishes)
Atmosphere is great but not as impressed with the food as the reviews would have me believe.   Shrimp flautas were very good and you get 4 so it's great to share.   Wasn't impressed with the flavors of the salsas and the guacamole.   Drinks were very expensive especially for the house tequila.   Staff was friendly but not overly attentive.
The Steak was no skirt steak as defined saw chunks of fat on that meat and my fries took a shower in the sauce i just felt like i drank a bottle of olive oil definitely not worth 19$ sorry.
Came by here for dinner with a friend, around 6pm on a weekday and we were seated immediately. Since it was the first time here for the both of us, we both ordered the Tonkotsu ramen and the Peking duck tacos. I enjoyed the ramen: the broth was flavorful but not overpowering or too salty and the noodles were springy. However, the pork chashu pieces did seem a bit smaller compared to other ramen joints. The Peking duck tacos were okay, but not worth $5. The communal tables were pretty interesting: it might be uncomfortable for some, but I enjoyed eating with the company of strangers and hearing their thoughts on the food. Since Momosan is only two blocks from my office, I will probably return during lunch time to try the Tokyo chicken, tantan ramen, and zoku don.
Location is awesome.  Food is fresh.  Service is excellent.  My friends and I dined here for Sunday brunch and we all cleaned our plates.  For brunch we had lobster, steak, bread, and salads but we didn't feel heavy and the food was light.  Afterwards we walked around the markets.  It's a great place to have brunch on a Sunday when the nearby markets are open.  Parking is pretty tricky, there is a garage about two blocks away or street parking if you're lucky.
I'm so disappointed at this place because I'm not feeling well after the dinner here days ago. I already made sure my meat/seafood was cooked long enough so that eliminated the possibility of sickness from eating raw. And now I started to question the sanity condition of this place and the freshness of food. I did not taste anything weird, so I cannot say anything about the latter part; yet the sanity was definitely something in concern. I remembered once I had a glimpse at their kitchen and got shocked at how greasy and unorganized things inside. In general Chinese restaurants suffered from the same issue and that had been partially compensated by the low price - it did not work for me and it will be a pass for me forever.  I did not rate it one star as I still believe this place had a great taste; nevertheless it is apparently not worthwhile for risking your health here.
"The first visit was just for drinks the weekend it opened and while the bar was small with no seating, the bartender was generous with the liquor. However the next visit I basically was served water with a splash of margarita mix as my drink. I went back two weeks later and decided to try the food and was very disappointed . 1) the guacamole is made to order infront of you except it took two attempts to get it to taste good. 2) I tried an assortment of tacos and they were truly awful. I was unpleasantly surprised that the shrimp tacos taste like store bought dethawed and then refried popcorn shrimp and the fish tacos were breaded and soggy. The steak tacos were tough and cold. Whatever their ""special sauce"" is is very bland and takes away from the tacos. The food was not fresh and did not have layers of flavors like most latin cuisines.  Hookah randomly starts to appear around 9pm. No menu- the waitress just comes over to whisper to you that its an option. Very sketchy. The place has nice decor and some potential but the food needs to re-worked to be more authentic and fresh and they should stop watering down drinks."
I appreciate the hologram Valentines card, but its sentiment seemed incongruous with the lack of syrup when I had pancakes brunch delivered
If you like seafood, a chill atmosphere, and don't mind trekking out to Queens, this is the spot for you. My group and I were excited to try this place after all the Facebook posts and videos of the wriggling octopus being eaten while it's squirming. We ordered a bunch of food outside of the main seafood pot and it was pretty good. Oily, but good. The octopus was a great source of entertainment as we watched it move like silky earthworms on the plate. The pot wasn't especially tasty, but definitely worth the try. We had 6 in our party and we only put a dent in the food.
On the pricer side but the matcha noodles were delicious, portions were a little small. Service was very accommodating, our party sized ended up growing after we got seated and the staff there easily found a bigger table for our group.  Drinks were okay, I felt they weren't sweet enough but this is coming from someone who likes everything sweeter.
Moving here from Seattle, it's been a little tough to find Vietnamese places...so we found this on a list of best vietnamese restaurants in NYC. (PS my husband and I's fascination with Vietnamese food starting after we went on a trip there earlier this year!)  We tried out this restaurant on a Sat night around 8PM, wait time was only 15 minutes, and their service is certainly on par! We ordered the Saigon Shack Pho, Beef Pho and then a Banh Mi to start (I was eyeing the papaya salad, but our waitress recommended the pork chop banh mi with an added fried egg (we just got the regular pork chop banh mi though))...We were only able to finish half of the sandwich and our 2 bowls of pho. :)  Why they're great: 1. Service (we interfaced with 4 different people in the restaurant during our 30 minutes there) and they were all friendly, yet efficient. We literally were in and out in 30 minutes (we are also not the type to linger..) :D 2. NO MSG in the broth! (I'm a little allergic) and I agree with the others on yelp saying it's a very clean broth, and I really liked it.  3. Prices! Very reasonable for the portion size.  Needs improvement: 1. Quality of the pho noodles. They had an interesting aftertaste that I didn't love. They were also slightly overdone.  2. Beef slices in the beef pho are thick (nice, b/c you get more meat, but the meat was quite difficult to bite through) 3. Cash only (I kinda get it, but still...:)) We would def. come back for a quick Vietnamese bite, but nothing stuck out that was stellar...
French brunch food here is very good!  The outdoor garden is very nice. The seating situation is a bit of a mess as there is no list they will try to remember who's next. The food service was pretty good with the wait staff but could be improved in the bar area. We showed up to ask to put our name on the list but was told another couple was ahead of us which was totally fine, no problem. However, the couple that was ahead of us received complementary cocktails as it was thrown in our face just because we wanted to sign in and they made it seem like we were cutting in front when we asked to put our names down on wait the list. Made no sense to treat us as if we were cutting in line as we only just showed up and wanted to put our names down and our wait was no longer than 10 minutes.  The food..... Fried chicken and mac and cheese ---- AMAZING!  Do order :) Bacon eggs Benedict - Delicious! Bourbon, beet and ginger cocktails was good but portion could be bigger for $8. All in all, I think this place is good but there's something that turned me off with the way we were treated at the time we entered and around the bar area.  I don't think I'll be back due to that but give it a try and maybe your experience will be better!
"I've been to Becco twice now and both times I've left feeling rather disappointed. I'm a big pasta fan so I always go for the ""home made"" pasta which isn't always home made, usually only one of them is the other two are what ever. The sauces are always watered down and lack flavor / punch. The wine list is meh and the waiters know absolutely nothing about. We ended up ordering a bottle and it was terrible- sent it back for a slightly better bottle. The service is always terribly slow, we weren't in a rush but it got to the point where we just assumed our server had left for the evening.  The dishes separate of the pasta menu looked good but it's NYC so I doubt I'll give it another chance- there are too many great Italian places like Crispos in the city."
"The perfect description of this place would be to call it: Perfectly-Imperfect. Compared to most other tourist trap food outlets Crown Cafe is actually not that bad.  There are a good array of soups, salads along with a few other ""healthy options"" and shockingly the prices are not as bad as they could be nor are the portion sizes as small as I thought they would be. I mean there are a few squirrely quirks that we found such as the kids meal (Junior Ranger meal since you're at a national park) hot dogs being listed as turkey dogs but the person who took my order mentioned that they have not had turkey dogs in a quite a while so ""beef"" is the only option. Also as other Yelpers have mentioned, the seating arrangement is just plain stupid. There simply are not enough seats for a slow Thursday in January let alone when this place gets cooking during touristy times of the year or during school field trip season.  You can't rely on outdoor seating twelve months out of the year for a place located in NY. Move the statue to Key West and things are great but as long as we're talking about being on the Hudson it just doesn't work.  But I guess when you've been the sole concessionaire to Liberty Island since the '30's, Evelyn Hill Inc. doesn't have to worry about things like enough seating capacity or hell even having proper seats at all. Also let's not even begin to discuss the cashiers who spend waaaaaay too much time talking/BSing with each other to even begin to know if someone is right in front of them or to care whether they ring things in correctly or not (1 kids meal on the house over here, Holla!). Overall it could be better (seating-staff) but it could be a whole lot worse (everything is fried/much smaller menu) so overall like I said earlier, perfectly-imperfect. Current Menu:"
I'm a fan of this place.  Came here for lunch and was a shame they didn't have the pasta tasting course :( Will have to come back here and get that tasting menu.  Our server was friendly, provided some suggestions, and overall pace was good.  The bread came with no butter at first and asked the bread lady for some,  She gave the butter and it sure did elevate my bread experience.  Warm, salty, and perfect for the bread! Everyone should be asking for butter for their bread here (amazed it wasn't offered when bread came out though first).  There was a mix-up with the appetizers ordering, where I wanted the shrimp in crazy water, but was not ordered.  I also ordered the clams with linguine and split it as an appetizer.  It was served a little too under for me (still raw) and was returned and came back just right, except there was no hint of chili flakes or spiciness.  Too bad, would have been a very good dish.   The beef cheek ravioli was so good, my generous wife gave me two of her pieces :) I would order this dish again and again.  My branzino was cooked perfectly and liked the roasted brussel sprouts, but not a fan of butternut squash. Nevertheless, it was real good.  The pistachio and chocolate semifreddo dessert was fantastic.  If you are a fan of pistachios, this is a winner!  Glad I finally tried this place and will need to come back for their pasta tasting menu!
House special and the homemade seaweed salad.  I love this place. It's tiny, it's cheap, no frills. Just genuinely wonderful home made noodles.
I love this place! This is hands down one of the best Asian tapas bar I've ever been to. We were told that it was about a 45 minute wait on a Friday evening around 6pm and they were right on the money with that estimate. We waited exactly that amount of time and we were glad we did. The food is amazing and the service is world class. Our server Bernard took the time to explain to us the menu and was kind enough to recommend things he loved about certain dishes. He even went out of his way to bring us some garlic aioli sauce when we told him that we weren't a fan of the sauce that came with the soft shelled crab. Thanks man! The drinks were really awesome because it comes in a clear pounch with a little ice cube light bulb.. definitely Instagram-Snapchat worthy. It was so good, I ordered two! I recommend getting the Lychee flavor, that was my favorite. Short: order the Kim chi fried rice, steak, soft shell crab and popcorn ice cream! I'll be back!
Service was absolutely pathetic. Very lackadaisical, nonchalant behaviour and also very rude. Didn't bring utensils, didn't explain the menu or answer questions in a satisfactory way. Food was not good. The beef soup was full of fat. Guess you get what you pay for
No place to seat, no place event to stand. Because it's not allowed close to the tables! Come on it's a bar! How can't you stand there? Where else then? Hate places where gratuity is already included. They charged 20% for party of 4. I am sorry, but this place doesn't worth it.  Fine for just sitting at the bar though.
Ah, the joy of seeing the look of joy on your friends' face when they try Los Tacos for the first time. I wrote a review for the original Chelsea Market location awhile ago, and I finally got to stop by this one last night with some friends.  This location is awesome and less busy. Long standing tables available. Unfortunately, no bathrooms but there's a lot of hotels nearby if you're in a hurry. There wasn't much of a line when I went last night around 7:45p.m. and the food comes our fairly fast. Order, give you ticket, find a table, and then go get your food!  I tried the ADOBADA ESPECIAL quesadilla for the time in awhile-- fried goodness and extra cheesy. Yum!
Maybe my expectations were too high... Came here for the lunch, and ordered bacon, salad, pinot noir by glass, and a steak for two.  Bread was cold and tasteless. Wine was just in norm,  Steak was decent, but not impressive. Steak did come out as ordered (medium rare), and thought it was resaonably flavorful, but it was bit rubbish.  Service? It was far below par than the restaurant of this caliber. With all the hassle you would have to go through, I would NOT recommend this place.
"Food was good but service AWFUL! On yelp they have 10% off but it didn't show at first it's only Monday to Friday. We asked the manager about it but he answered so RUDE! Saying ""well you only got a pizza"" I'm sorry but does it matter what we ordered? Treat your customers with respect. Not coming back"
Breakroom is insanely delicious, even writing this review has me drooling like Pavlov's dog over here. I was directed to this hole in the wall by the officer of the court during my jury duty. When I asked him the best place to eat in the area, he told me the tacos couldn't be missed here - he was NOT wrong.  I came in at lunch and there was already a healthy line. The space itself is small, a few tables, many order ahead or take it to go. I ordered three tacos to-go, as part of their ten-dollar taco sampler, and didn't have to wait very long. The pork belly and fish tempura tacos are game changers, the cheese steak taco was also very good, but couldn't compare to the others. You don't come to Breakroom if you want a healthy lunch, this is all burgery-taco goodness.
Went to Nargis last Monday. Surprisingly quite full for a Monday night. The restaurant is cute and cozy, with the bar area on one side and seating area on the other. The food and servicing was terrific. I recommend the lamb shank and their bread. Great addition to the neighborhood and love that the food is pretty unique. Definitely recommend and would come again.
I've wanted to like this place for years. I've probably eaten here 10 times. The space is great, as is the location, right across from the park. But the food has never been good, and has now finally reached inedible. Whoever is cooking it doesn't care at all, that much is clear. Burned pancakes, with insanely rubbery squid and raw red peppers inside. Dry, stringy wings with gross seasoning. Completely bland stews and bibimbaps. And the tacos have left me nauseous or with a stomach ache every time I've foolishly ordered them. To put it simply, if chef boyardee made canned Korean food, this is how I would expect it to taste. Korean cuisine has been my favorite for years and I guess that's why I keep coming back to the only Korean spot in greenpoint. But I am now officially breaking up with you little dokebi. I'll make the trip to 32nd ST from now on. You are the emotionally abusive drunk chick who I always called on when I was lonely but now I'm moving on. Good riddance.
Xi'an has made changes in staff since my roommate had a severe gluten allergy to a meal that he bought there.  In light of the fact that I have had more than 10 excellent meals since then, prepared by in no time at all, by very friendly employees, I am raising my review to four starts.   The Cold Noodles are great.
My friend and I came for a quick dinner on Pride Sunday around 7:30pm; there was no wait if we sat at the bar. The bartender was very friendly and over good recommendations. Please see my photos for extra info/details. THE COST: $65 total for a light dinner for two (1 app, 2 pastas). Quite pricey and not super worth it in my mind. CRUDO * Beef Carpaccio (rye crisps, horseradish, cream. $16) - 3 stars This was too salty; we had to neutralize it with bread from our bread basket. PASTA * Garbanelli (mushroom ragu, ricotta salata. $18) - 4 stars This was very al dente, a good texture, and the sauce had quite a strong mushroom flavor. I'm not a huge fan of mushroom, but my friend who likes it enjoyed this dish. * Spaghetti (garlic, chilies, parmesan. $19) - 3.5 stars I didn't think that this would come with a heavy oily sauce and was disappointed because my stomach was expecting a nice red sauce. The pasta was once again very al dente, and there was a strong kick form the garlic.
Was very excited to eat at the legendary Le Bernardin for our anniversary. The ambiance was immaculate as well as the service. Wine service could not have been better. What fell short was the food. The food lacked dimension, flavor, and seasoning. It was so disappointing. With so many options in New York - best spend 500$ on dinner elsewhere.
One of the better Mario Battali restaurants. A bit on the formal and stuffy side. We were fortunate to be seated upstairs because the downstairs was terribly loud and crowded. Do make reservations as this place is packed every night! We did have a reservation, but still had to wait about 10-15 minutes for our table.  Our server was stuffy and old school. There's such pomp and circumstance here...we asked for bread because we were starving and she informed us that the bus boy in charge of the bread would come around to us eventually. Okay. My pappardelle bolognese was actually pretty delicious and a good-sized portion. My friend liked his steak, though I didn't get to try any (again because we were really hungry) and because the portion was really tiny. Not terribly expensive. The food is definitely good and worth it. Do dress to impress, this isn't one of those restaurants where you should roll in with your jeans and sneakers. The interior is charming and old school Italian and has loads of romantic ambiance so I would highly suggest it for any special occasion or date.
Food was delicious, but service was atrocious! Ate here on a Wednesday night, ordered the steak for two, it come out marginally undercooked, but extremely delicious none the less!  The server really couldn't be bothered with us, he took our order, and that was about the end of it. He did ask us if we would like another serve of bread, which we very excitedly said yes (because it was amazing) but he never returned! We saw him about an hour later when he handed us the bill... Very poor way to treat customers. Bottom line, food great, server gets zero stars.
"I wasn't completely blown away by the udon here, but I must applaud their top-notch decor/ambience: cozy, intimate, and trendy.  My friend and I both ordered bowls of udon in large (regular and large are both the same price) and shared a spicy tuna tartare cone appetizer. I picked the duck udon with thick noodles and my friend got the deluxe. The udon noodles were average and I would say comparable to the many frozen brands you can pick up at the market. Broth was flavorful, but lukewarm. That was a huge disappointment. Piping hot soup is an absolute must when it comes to soup noodles! My friend and I were also surprised by their portion sizes and did appreciate how they actually meant it when they called it ""large"". However, a part of me can't help but think that I would rather have smaller portions for lower prices. Rather than ordering a bowl of udon per person, I would highly recommend trying out several of their sides/appetizers and sharing one large bowl of udon."
What a joke of a restaurant. Probably the worst dining experience in recent memory. Has the whole city gone taste blind?? Almost dish was inedibly salty... The octopus was like eating big hunks of salt. Same thing with the mushroom tacos. Absolutely no flavor but PURE SALT. The lamb was the only thing edible, but covered with some vegetable that was charred beyond recognition (we couldn't even tell what it was). And the flat bread that came with the lamb was so cold and dry, they hadn't even bother to toast it. The duck fat fries were totally meh. Four of these small plates, no drinks, totaled $80 with tax and 15% tip. Ha! The waiter was very rude and he threw the check at us. WTF... FYI, this place is super tiny, we were locked in a corner by another table of 4 people, and the walls were stained and dirty. It was also extremely loud, I had a hard time hearing my friend and I had to shout to be heard by my friend. I was bloated after eating here, and had mad heartburn. NEVER AGAIN.
"I've been a happily loyal customer here for years, stopping by every time I visited NYC and regularly now that I live here. But I won't be going back again after my most recent experience, when they charged me $5 for a small piece of toasted baguette. I know this city is expensive, but seriously?  I'd ordered a mulled wine and wanted to munch on something small so I didn't drink on an empty stomach; I asked for a piece of bread, which I'd done before and been charged at most $2 (if at all). This time, when my check came, it had a $5 charge for a toasted 3"" chunk of bread. I asked the hostess why it was so expensive and she coldly said ""That's just how much it costs."" I pointed out that this made a piece of bread more expensive than a chocolate croissant and that if I'd known this I would have just ordered something else, but she just sighed and said, again ""That's how much we charge for bread."" I explained I was usually charged a few dollars, and she just stared and sighed at me until I went away.  This used to be my favorite place to go in the neighborhood for a snack or breakfast; now, I realize they have no concern for making customers feel welcome. It's really disappointing. I guess they just feel they don't need the business anymore now that they're a tourist destination."
Solid steak that's better than your average steakhouse; however, nothing mind blowing. That cheesecake and whip cream though is another story! FOOD: - Assorted bread basket: These breads were not warm when they were delivered. :(  - PorterHouse & Ribeye for 4: Solid. The steaks were cooked perfectly for medium rare, and had tons of flavor. The steaks had a perfect balance of burnt crusts and tender center.  - Cream Spinach and German Potatoes: The side dishes were extremely boring and average. The cream spinach didn't taste as though if it had cream in it at all, and the german potatoes tasted a bit like the potatoes you get from a diner.  - Cheesecake & Whip Cream: Not sure if it's because we had a large table that ordered a ton of food or if our server was just being nice but he gave us a free cheesecake! If I was to come back for only 1 thing, it would be that cheesecake and whip cream. The Cheesecake delicious, very firm and had an excellent crust at the bottom. As for that whip cream though...it's AMAZING! I've never had whip cream so fluffy, THICK, and the perfect balance of sweetness! I could eat this forever.  SERVICE: - Tons of reviews from the Zagat talk about the rude and non-sense wait staff; however I found our server extremely nice! He was great and was very helpful in selecting the right amount of food and wine.  OVERALL: - It was a great experience, not dying to come back but not opposed to it either. Recommend you trying it at least once to see for yourself.
I took my wife here for her birthday, we were in NY on holiday and this was following a Broadway show.  I'll start with the good. The view is beautiful, albeit it was a rainy day. The food was nice, not spectacular but 4* for sure.  Now as to why it got 2*. Firstly I got a call to see if I'd be able to arrive earlier, i got the latest reservation of 10:30 on open table since it coincided with the show times. On arrival I see why. There were about 3 tables finishing up and soon enough we were the last table there. Throughout the whole meal i felt rushed to the point that my wife noticed and it dampened the mood.  At various points where some privacy was appreciated there were people hovering, not to serve but to get us whatever we wanted to get us the hell outta there. They couldn't have given us and collected the check faster. On exiting I even regretted leaving only 10% tip given the farewell received. We've been going to many nice restaurants and this fell short off the potential.  All in all,  I bet the service would have been better at an earlier time, but then why offer the time to book? I could have gone uptown somewhere in Manhattan for a view at that time and it'd be full. The food was not worth this at all,  and if i wanted that view there's an ice cream parlor and a seaside bench next door that'd have been just as effective.
We came here for my sister's birthday dinner celebration because it's walking distance from her apartment.  The food was good but it wasn't really a place that I would say I would want to come back to and try other dishes.  I ordered the salmon dish, my fiance ordered the pasta special (FYI pasta is made in house) and my sister ordered the duck.  The salmon had the skin left on but was crispy and served over what I thought was quinoa but my sister told me that it was actually barley.  The barley was a good substitute to rice.  It was mixed with what looked like yellow squash and had a slightly sweet taste to it.  The pasta was served with a nice cream sauce and sausage that had no casing.  I didn't get to try the duck but my sister said it was good.  The servings aren't that big and the price per dish was a little pricey.  It wasn't that busy but I'm assuming it's because it was about 8 degrees outside.  Maybe I'll come back to try their brunch but not interested to come back for dinner.
**Restaurant Week Summer 2017 Review** My sister and I made a reservation through Open Table the day before and there were plenty of times available. We came in at 7 on a Wednesday and one of their dining rooms was full. And when I say full, I mean cramped, as in we were pretty much sitting elbow to elbow with strangers. It wasn't until I went to go use the restroom did I discover another dining room, which was almost empty. I guess they did that to make it seem more poppin than it actually was. To start, I had the Pate de Campagne Maison (served with cornichons, dijon, and pearl onions). My sister had the Ravioles de Royan (stuffed comte cheese and garlic little tiny raviolis with cream and truffles). The pate had too much of some type of seasoning - couldn't quite put my finger on what it Waals, but the pearl onions and side salad it came with definitely helped balance it out a bit. On the other hand, the ravioli was amazing. They even had whole pieces of truffle in it. The portion size would was perfect for an appetizer because anymore, and it would have been overkill. For the main, I had the Steak Tartare with Toasted Pugliese Bread, and she had the Pan-Seared Hangar Steak. I enjoyed my steak tartare but after finished about a third of it, it was a little much. I think this would have been better in a smaller portion, as an appetizer instead. The hangar steak was chewy but the flavor was excellent, as they cooked it in a generous amount of fresh garlic. For dessert, I had the scoop of Cranberry Sorbet. It was nice and refreshing after a heavy meal like this. I was only able to eat about half though because it was pretty tart. My sis had the Banana Brûlée (french vanilla custard with fresh sliced bananas and smashed graham crackers), which she loved. Not sure I'd be back, as I'm not a fan of cramped restaurants and I only thought the food was better than okay, and not great.    Tip - a glass of their house Bordeaux was $9, which wasn't bad at all, for its quality.
"I checked into this place for a late afternoon dinner before heading home. I saw it while roaming around Williamsburg so I decided I'd let it be my last meal before heading back to my side of  Brooklyn. I have to say I've frequented a LOT of BBQ joints in my day and this one is pretty much bottom of the barrel. In fact I look at the reviews and wonder if the people who've eaten here have experienced BBQ any place outside of NYC. In hindsight I realized I should've been susupicious of this place when they call themselves a ""Smokehouse"" and yet the first item on the menu is ""Pulled Chicken""...Who does that?!! Really great BBQ places pride themselves on 3 main items: Pulled PORK, Ribs and Brisket! If those 3 items ain't your first offerings then there's a problem. My partner & I [unfortunately] ordered the brisket to share with a side of cole slaw and corn bread. We were WOEFULLY underwhelmed! The brisket was dry and lifeless! It was beige, had absolutely NO flavor and again, was D-R-Y! NO juices, no smoke ring, no melt-in-your-mouth goodness at all. The cornbread muffins were also dry and tasted like they were baked the prior week. I now understand the point of the complimentary side of pickled, spicy salad. It's to rid the taste of the mediocre BBQ from your mouth. And as if that wasn't bad enough it took darn near 20 minutes to get 2 drinks and there was literally NO ONE in the joint! Bottom line, this is NOT a BBQ Smokehouse, this is a pathetic Williamsburg version of a BBQ Smokehouse. My partner & I were not impressed and we will NOT be coming back...EVER!"
Honestly not impressed. While the service is great and the ambience is cute, the food just didn't blow me away. The herbed fries came out first (after 15-20 minutes) and while the seasoning was good, the fries themselves were a little soggy. Next we had the chilaquiles without chicken which was mildly spicy and had a nice texture. I had the pancakes which came out with pineapple and mascarpone cream cheese (I think the topping changes every day). While the topping was perfectly sweet, the pancakes themselves weren't as fluffy or tasty as I hoped.
Pros - the rachaburi is truly a significant menu. Ive been to this restaurant many times and it is a must order menu for me - the somtam is fresh and goes along well with the sauce. I like spicy food and this was perfect for me Cons - Inside of this restaurant is not very spacious - their pad thai was not that amazing. I felt like it was kinda of too sweet Overall, this definitely is one of my fav Thai restaurant in the city. As I mentioned above, I think their rachaburi and somtam are so good that all of you should not miss!
"This place is a joke. My friends and I came in from Manhattan specifically to try Emily based off the reviews/Instagram hype. The traffic was so bad getting into Brooklyn we got there and it was maaaaybe 3:05. I had no idea that they closed mid-day, but I get it. There were still people finishing up eating and hanging out in the restaurant so after we asked if we could just place and order to go really quickly, we were just going to get pizza, nothing crazy. The woman at the front was like ""Yea sorry, closed."" So my friend goes up to her and explained that it took a crazy long time to get here because traffic was so backed up, is there any way we could just grab a pizza. Her response was ""the workers already clocked out."" But you could see people in the kitchen still working. Like I get it was our fault, we should have left earlier. But she could have cared less, and showed no empathy whatsoever. She should have just worn a shirt that said #sorrynotsorry."
I finally managed to make it to pies -n-thighs I was so excited to finally taste the food!! So the spot is tucked in a small area of Williamsburg right on the corner of s4 st. The staff was really friendly & welcoming. The restaurant is kinda small and tight to move around in, but it's doable. I ordered the fried catfish with mac & cheese,& biscuit and the homemade half and half. Oh and I also purchased a old fashioned doughnut.  So the catfish was pretty good but the batter which is made with corn meal kinda through me off in the beginning but once you squeeze the lemon over it it balanced out the distinct taste. The portions given for the sides you choose such as collard greens, mac & cheese etc are pretty small which I found a little of being that a meal is roughly 14-18$$. For that price I think there could have been more food given but hey.. just my opinion. The BISCUIT is to DIE for . So creamy, buttery and soft!  I'd say the homemade lemonade and doughnut were okay. But I wouldn't purchase them again.  With pies n thighs its a hit or miss ! I wouldn't mind going again to try another dish to gather a stronger opinion about the food.  Overall the food is okay, not as good as I anticipated!!  So I gave it 2 stars
While the dining area is not the most glamorous, the cheap tapas and casualness of this quaint little store offer a good place to stop for snacks while in the area. The food was nothing special to warrant an out of the way trip.  Food: Goat cheese on toast - very good  Tortilla with cheese - good  Octopus - good
My husband and I went for the $1 oyster special at this restaurant. Great deal for pretty decently fresh oyster.
Chicken Sliders were burnt and they used dark meat? C'mon it's 2017 for God sakes. I would rather have Chik-Fil-A across the street. For a place that is supposed to be trendy, organic and proper this place was not impressive. It's overpriced for what it is. The Prime-dip was decent but nothing special. The Au-Jus was the only good thing about the dishes. The fries seemed homemade but were soggy. Save your money and eat elsewhere!!
"Came here tonight for dinner with a friend and we had a bad experience with this place and the staff! We had to wait for the table for 20minutes but that's okay for the neighborhood. The food was okay, not great and came in small portion and we had to wait some time to get it. Once we almost finished eating, the waitress rushed us to finish (in a very rude way) and leave the table for the next customer without asking if we wanted anything else like dessert or coffee . Then another waiter came to us, asking us to finish quickly. We said as soon as we finish our drinks we are leaving on to what he replied and I quote : ""I think we gave you plenty of time for what you paid""... we were there for nearly 50minutes. No need to say that I don't recommend this place."
I hate giving bad reviews to any places that I've been because sometimes I think it is unfair to the restaurant especially when I only have been there once. However, in the case of Selamat Pagi, I just have to make the exception.  Dropped by at this place on a Sunday afternoon. The place was not busy at all and there were two tables occupied. After looking at the brunch menu, I decided to order the most basic dish for anybody who came from Asia specifically Malaysia and Indonesia or even Singapore and Brunei would be familiar with which is Nasi Goreng. The second dish was some sort of baked fish pancake or roti. Ordered it just for a test taste.  Let me just say don't be fooled by the look of it but the Nasi Goreng was terrible. I mean it was edible but come on, I am pretty sure the chef can whip up something way better or tasteful than that if he or she has any sense of what Nasi Goreng should taste like. Indonesia is known for its spices and there was not a slight hint of spices or whatsoever in the Nasi Goreng. I am paying $17 for a plate of rice and it better taste like it is worth $17 to me. Ok fine maybe the chef had a bad day I get it but there was simply nothing special about the Nasi Goreng. The baked fish pancake was simply two pieces of fish lumped together with cabbages, dribbled with some sauce and put on top of dried pancake or roti which I noticed was sort of like an Indian roti that I normally get from the frozen section of the Patel Brothers supermarket in Jackson Heights. The food, in other words, was atrocious. Yes, I did eat them all because I hate wasting food. I would probably drop by again one of these days to give Selamat Pagi a second chance but judging from the look of it, it wouldn't be anytime soon.
With so many high end Italian establishments in Manhattan, it's hard to say where L'Artusi stacks up, but I have to believe at its price point it's among the very best. I never like to proclaim favorites for fear of finding something better, but I'd be hard pressed to find any Italiano that does as stellar a job as L'Artusi. It's hard not to love the open kitchen, contemporary decor, and modern dining feel. The layout in the upstairs dining room is date appropriate for sure, though for food enthusiasists the spot at the open kitchen counter / crudo bar might just be the best spot in the house. Bathrooms are immaculate and the level service is of the highest caliber. The menu is a simple breakdown of appetizers, vegetables, pasta, seafood, and meat. There are a lot of seasonal elements the staff will often note when taking one's order, but one can't lose with a menu in which everything is spot on. If dining in a group, consider the Dayboat Scallops ($15) as a starter and the incredible Beef Carpaccio ($16), which is decorated with rye crisps and a superb horseradish crema. Folks have raved about the Roasted Mushrooms ($17), which come with a fried egg and pancetta but with my edible fungus issues, I have to pass each time. The Butter Lettuce ($14) is indeed buttery, dressed with a lemon crema, gorgonzola, olives, and hazelnuts. For kale lovers, the Kale Salad ($15) is fairly standard with walnuts, parmesan, and apple slices, but the Roasted Beets ($14) is my veggie pick of the litter, which sits in a rich whipped ricotta, red sorrel, and pistachio bits. Amongst the seafood and carne choices, a blind pick would probably do one just fine. The Branzino ($22) is a popular choice amongst patrons, though I have a penchant for the Charred Octopus ($18) and Roasted Cod ($30). The foodgasmic entree of them all is the Hanger Steak ($26), which is a perfect medium rare sear and in perfect steak-and-potatoes fashion features a crispy home-fries ish side and a complementary salsa bianco. The Seared Sweetbreads ($16) won't fill anyone up, but the white bean puree, escarole, chorizo works so well with the 'breads that it would be my favorite appetizer if it were categorized as such. Carb lovers will appreciate the variety of pasta on the menu, of which there are more choices than anything else. The classic Spaghetti ($18) is delicious, but the star for me is the Bucatini ($19) which is perfectly al dente with pancetta, tomato puree, and pecorino for a salty component. Tagliatelle ($20) is a no fail pasta choice given its bolognese base, but the star of the Linguine Nero ($24), a wonderful blend of linguine, rock shrimp, chilies, topped off with bread crumbs. This is a must try dish for anyone who dines here. The West Village has so many great eateries of the Italian kind, but make L'Artusi part of the itinerary and it's unlikely to disappoint.
Well the service is Nice the Food is Ok but The Lobster roll is Kinda Overrated in my opinion
Service is terrible. They act like they've been there for years and I should be grateful to be there. I don't even know my servers name because she just rolled her eyes at every interaction and never introduced herself. I think it was mostly because it was so late but they just looked pissed to be working that late
Trendy pricey eatery that was more about the scene than the food. Pasta served in small portions. Grilled squid salad was charred and dry. Seafood pasta had over-cooked rubbery shrimp. Spaghetti with meatballs was dry and tasteless. Best dish was the chicken marsala served with crispy roasted potatoes.
I'd I could give this place a zero I would. We arrived at 9:35 with notice that it was last call even though they close at 10. That means u should at least be able to order until at least 10 before. The floors were filthy black and wet and there were wet rags they used to clean our table that had disgusting food scraps on it.  We started to order 2 minutes later and were ordering a few items. The waitress was really rude and kept telling us it is last call. I was going to add one more item when she pulled the menu from my hand and said last one. I told her I was going to order one more thing and she just stared at me as if it wasn't allowed. This all happened while the owners and other workers looked on. My husband and I decided we didn't wanna sit in filth and deal with extremely terrible service despite the good reviews on the food so we got up and left. Worst experience ever, will never step foot in this place again!!
The bartender was so awesome. We were here during happy hour and she made us some pretty strong margaritas. I'd advise you if you aren't sitting at the bar to just go there to order your drink. They tend to put more liquor in when you are watching.  The food was just meh. My friends and I were all starving and this was the first place we could find in the area. We had the artichoke dip, turkey sandwich, Italian sandwich and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese is flavorful but the pasta is super soft. The artichoke dip tasted more like warm hummus and didn't have the chunks of artichokes that we were expecting. The Italian sandwich was on this bread that was a bit tough like it had been sitting out for a while. Overall, it wasn't a satisfying meal but I may stop in for happy hour when I'm in the area.
"Went in for ""soft opening"" and ordered a beer at the bar to wait for my friend.  Was told cash only for the time being, and lucked out by actually having cash tonight.  After she arrived, we sat down with the food menu and we decided to order (half rack ribs [$17], mac and cheese + brisket [$13], and chicken and waffles [$16]).  Ten minutes later, I had finished my first beer and flagged down a waiter to order a second beer (which never came).  About thirty minutes after ordering my second beer, we were approached by who I assumed to be the manager asking if we could leave the table so others who wanted to dine could sit, I guess since it looked like we were taking up a table with nothing but cups of water.  I explained to her that we were waiting on our food for 40 minutes plus, and she was apologetic and went to go ""check on it"".  After a minute or two, I decided to walk up to her in the corner by the POS and ask that my order be cancelled if it was not yet in, and that I didn't mind giving up the table.  She was again apologetic, asked if I would like a round of drinks on the house, and that the food would be out in 5 minutes.  Five minutes later, nobody had come for our drink order (or my second beer for that matter), and the hostess came over and stated ""its going to be longer than five minutes"" while simultaneously asking the people on the bench attached to ours to move so people could be seated. I am understanding to the fact that it is a ""soft opening"" and they were busier than they expected, but being asked to stay and wait for my food after expressing my desire to leave, and then basically asked to leave again so they could seat a new larger party at my table rubbed me the wrong way.  The waitresses were professional and kind, but seemed to be confused every time they went over to the POS.  In our 45 minutes of watching bussers bring food from the kitchen, they nearly never got the table right, and walked back and forth seemingly confused as to which table they were serving.  Also, there were no less than five bartenders working behind the bar from what I could see, but only two (maybe three) waiters. TLDR: Food looked and smelled good, but never got it.  Asked to leave my table basically twice after ordering, and either inexperienced and/or under trained staff were not able to handle the crowd the ""soft opening"" drew in.  Cool ""neighborhoods of queens"" theme to the menu, with a lot of good sounding (at least on paper) foods."
"We got here on a Saturday night at about 8:30pm and had a 30 minute wait. So far, so good! But wait! Not so soon. We ordered a small half Margherita half white pizza, which was 14"" and had six slices total. Since that's just a plain pizza, we also added pepperoni, Italian sausage, and sautéed spinach. Note: every single topping you add is extra, so don't be too extra. Once it came out, I dove right into the white pizza first. It was good, and I love that the cheese blobs cake out a little toasty like a brûlée meringue! The Margherita was also good, but after we were finished, I sat there struggling to figure out how that pizza was worth $23.50 + $11 toppings.. long story short it wasn't. We didn't get any drinks and after tax and tip, our bill was $44. For that price, I expect a gourmet pizza that is off the charts and blows my mind like no other pizza has done before, but it didn't. On top of that, this place is cash only and serves you with paper plates and plastic cups. It may just be me, but that's a giant profit margin to not want to afford some better utensils (even if you wanted to keep the traditional feel, I'm sure there are better options). I didn't listen to the other overpriced reviews on here because I wanted to make my own judgment, but...... I think it's overpriced."
Ramen is a passion for many diners these days. Almost anyone can namedrop Ippudo (which one?), Totto (again, which one?), Momosan (I saw Chef Morimoto once!), Momofuku Noodle Bar (I saw David Chang twice!)...the list goes on and on. However, few I know have name-checked Mu Ramen. So, when a fellow food-obsessive friend of mine raved about the place, I knew I had to find out for myself how good this place could possibly be. Turns out it was every bit as good as I could have imagined. We arrived just in time for the 5pm opening so we could stake our claims to the namesake Mu Ramen - an oxtail and bone marrow broth ramen of which they only make 20 bowls per day. The broth is silky and very hearty with the essence of both ingredients, with some graininess as well coming from the marrow's contents. The noodles are thin the way I like them, counterbalancing the deep richness of the broth. For appetizers, we also got the tebasaki gyoza upon on my friend's suggestion, a creation of mad genius involving fried chicken stuffed with foie gras and brioche. I mean, give me a break. The ingredients sure were familiar, but put together it was like a turkey with stuffing on crack. Don't forget, it's essentially goose liver in a chicken. Meanwhile the clams were well-done with a lovely spicy dipping sauce, but was ultimately surpassed by the aforementioned fried chicken dish.. I cannot forget to mention perhaps the perfect drink to accompany such an indulgent meal  - the apple juice. I am fairly confident I will not have juice of any kind as good as this. Though $16 for the bottle, trust me this isn't your childhood store-bought Mott's or Juicy Juice. My friend described the Tsugaru apple juice perfectly as tasting the crisp sweetness of an apple peel in every sip. I never thought I would say these words: forget the wine and opt for juice! Mu Ramen has elevated the ramen game in my eyes, catering to a slightly upscale clientele while choosing to remove itself from the hyper-competitive landscape of Manhattan ramen (e.g. East Village and Hell's Kitchen).With creative appetizers and stunning ramen, Mu Ramen is the only ramen spot I have been to that I feel merits repeat visits in order to try everything on the menu.
Delicious. Great service.. Got the branzino and salmon. The lobster tacos were AMAZING! Wish I could have had more than two. I suggest going with fish- good portions and very tasty. I saw a couple of people order the pasta dishes nearby, they looked smaller but also looked great too. Will definitely be back.
"Terrible service, lots of bad attitude, too crowded, and not worth it! Trekking out to the middle of nowhere for this punishment was a bad idea. We ordered a few of the daily specials and were extremely disappointed -- the food is overall very bland, the portions are big and flavorless, and I had to dowse everything in sriracha for some taste and spice. On top of it, after eating the ""mussels in coconut curry"" my husband and I got a bad stomach. The mussels were super fishy, and huge --3.5 inches of flesh. This ""appetizer"" was big enough for 2 people. Wtf? We are both grossed out by the entire experience that we will never understand how people flock here to eat. Never again."
Fish tacos we're BOMB. Came in a little after 12 so the place was packed for lunch rush. Get there early if you want to get a seat and have two or more people. Also tried the steak taco but pales in comparison to the fish. Will be coming back to try the infamous breakroom burger and fries.
Fantastic brunch at a great price. My friend and I came for brunch and both entrees were great. I believe we paid around $80 for two entrees, two desserts and 7 glasses of sangria!
3.5 stars The pies here are ginormous. They're good, especially if you're a fan of the floppy. Tried the margherita pizza with fennel sausage and arugula. I like my pizzas most with unusual toppings and flavors (and less cheese) so while I probably won't be coming back to stand in line, I definitely understand the hype. Just not my personal favorite (although perhaps if I ordered a marinara pizza with roasted peppers / prosciutto  I would feel differently). (Also the line here is noticeably shorter than Grimaldi's and based on reviews / recommendations of friends, Juliana's is the better rendition. Don't get sucked into the wrong line.)
"Checked in on 10/1/2016. Maybe my bad experience can be attributed to the walk-in section of this trendy restaurant, which is also called the ""Lounge"".  No reservations are taken for the lounge.  Main dining section gets reserved early, so if you want to dine in to check all the hype, you need to step up your game and reserve a table in advance.  That I did not!  The lounge was overcrowded with people just trying to shout over the really loud music which was playing.  I'm not even sure how they could shout over...the music was so loud.   Cons: slow poor service, small tables (unless you are just 2 or having only drinks), loud, very loud music, food not matching the hype. My dining experience stars with good food.  I did not even like the food.  Here's what we ordered: 1) Crispy Cauliflower Lollipops - ok 2) Black Dragon Chicken - this was the worst dish out of all we ordered. Very bland, no flavor. 3) Chilled Udon Noodles - good. 4) Spiced eggplant and Tofu - ok 5) Bread pudding - excellent 6) Crying chocolate - excellent Desserts saved the night (and the 3 star rating)!  The restaurant is beautifully decorated, but lack of everything else spoiled it for me."
Pretty darn decent takeout. Alas, eating in was not an option on a Saturday afternoon. They were already 30 minutes deep into the waiting list and the herds just kept on a'coming, so we opted for takeout. Good options though not a huge menu (we wanted more choices - apparently a new menu is on the near horizon).  Meat quality in the pad see ew was questionable, the chili shrimp contained all of 5 shrimp (yep, 5) and the rice dish had rather poorly cooked broken mushy rice, but I will say the flavors were top notch.  I'm giving it a 4 as I imagine they do better work in house, and perhaps the lunch special portions of the shrimp dish would be less ostentatiously tiny at an evening repast. Overall, I'd be very happy if Pure Thai Cookhouse were our go-to-takeout-thai in Park Slope, which alas, it is not, but that to me makes it worth a gander.
Decent meat dishes but was disconcerting to be able to see into kitchen and see them microwave our food. Maybe this happens elsewhere, and it's just this place that didn't invest in a curtain. :-)
This is my second time visiting. I loved here when I visited for the first time a month ago, but it was really disappointing today.  Pho - too oily and watery. They used to give more noodles and meat and was quite good, but not anymore. Chicken in a claypot - not much chicken in here. Mostly scallion and ginger haha Customer service - once customers sit at the bar, they wont change your seat to a table even if there's plenty of tables without reservations and no other customers waiting. This is their restaurant policy according to the server. Ive been to numerous restaurants in the city and this is the first time I had to fight with the server to get an empty table.
I went to the flagship Nargis a while ago and fell in love with everything- the food, the vibe, the people.  I'm beside myself now that there is a location two blocks from my home.  Same amazing food, vibe and people.  We will be regulars.  This definitely ranks in my top ten favorite restaurants in the entire New York City region.
Chicken Francese is too oily. The lemon butter sauce, just so-so. Can you believe that the Free bread and dipping sauce are the best thing in my meal? But the environment here is quite good.
Terrible service!! I ordered a wedge salad w pulled chicken n Alamo fries not a huge order. I live in the Co Op buildings right across the street. I Waited over an hour and when I called them they put me on hold for over 2 mins n said give him another five min.  So after another two phone calls and another half hour I called again and he gave me another excuse so I told him I want to cancel the order. Not the first time that it has taken over am hour for a delivery to arrive. I live so close they could walk it over here in two minutes. Terrible service n long delivery times
Honestly, I was expecting more from a Mario Batali restaurant, especially after a friend raved about it.  Their specials sounded amazing, but I decided to go with the gnocchi (their version is made of ricotta cheese, instead of potato) with sausage and fennel. The sauce was tomato based, and I expected there to be chunks of sausage and for it to be separate from the sauce, but it was embedded in the sauce. Also, I didn't really taste the fennel. The gnocchi was pretty good though and tasted light, with a nice texture.  The entree portions were quite small. At least the appetizer of slices of potato with lemon and rosemary were a bit more substantial. The potato pieces were thick, crispy, tasty with lots of flavor from the rosemary and lemon. The prices were a bit on the higher side. I am glad that I picked the gnocchi for my main course, versus the special, which was twice as much. My friend ended up getting a fish dish, which had a decent taste, but was definitely not worth $25. The service was spotty. For example, I think we were supposed to get bread, but the waiter never brought us any and we didn't think to ask until we saw they had brought bread to another table and by that time, we had already finished eating. I don't plan on coming back and I probably won't trust the person who recommended the place, regarding restaurants, but I am glad I had the chance to try it for myself.
Good drinks. And that's the only thing going for this place. Served me a frozen steak that was still cold in the middle. Also I'm 90% sure the shrimp that was served to me was a few days old. The service was top notch. But they really dropped the ball on my meal. Would not recommend. Also worth noting that as soon as they saw yelp they took my uncooked steak away so I couldn't post photos.  Additionally, I had flown out from the west coast for a wedding, and the manager had the audacity to ask me to give it another try next time. Next time? You're a steakhouse charging $200/meal with tip, taxes and drinks. You don't get a second chance. You're supposed to not fuck yo. If I wanted to try two or three times to get the right steak I woulda just gone to outback.  This place is insulting our intelligence by lying about their products and conning people into spending money there.  Run! Save yourself, don't listen to the fake reviews they post! Go somewhere else!
Great brunch place. Went here during a bachelorette party weekend in NY. I had the lobster roll  with salad and it was pretty delicious. A little too much mayo, but I still devoured the whole thing and left my plate clean. My friends got fries and they came in a huge plate that was overflowing. Get those for sharing! They also store your luggage, which is really nice because we had checked out of our AirBnb and still had time to kill before we went to the airport. Cute benches outside as a waiting area too.
Perhaps I would really enjoy this place if only I knew the secret code to get a table there. We attempted to eat here on a recent Saturday night, knowing that it gets crowded and thus we arrived at 6:30. I expected there might be some wait, but I was excited when I walked in and saw a couple of open tables. Given that their website clearly states that they do NOT take reservations for parties of less than 5 people, I got my hopes up only to have them dashed by the host who informed us that we'd have a 2 hour wait! Wait a minute....I asked....there was no line and I spotted a couple of open tables. Oh, those people called ahead to get a table, the host told me. Apparently, one can call in advance and make a quasi-reservation, even though their website states a no reservation policy. What??  Place looked cozy and I am sure the food is delish. Maybe some day I'll learn the inside secret to enable dining there. For now, I am turned off by their game playing. Either take reservations or not, and please be clear about it on your website. Don't use this system for some folks, but not others.  I suspect they think the secret to being popular is to turn people away in some sort of hard-to-get fashion. I played those games in high school . Not interested now.
This place is cute. Rustic. Every plate they served us had cracks in them. Bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar was served. I had their Cotoletta di Vitello alla Milanese (veal). When I got the plate all I saw was greens. I thought they gave me someone's salad. Dug in further and I found the veal. Hmm... this is the 1st I've seen this dish plated this way. The meat should be on top. Poor presentation or just their style? The veal was OK for the fact that it wasn't pre-seasoned or maybe it was slightly... Salt was sprinkled on top of the veal. I couldn't eat the greens since this was way too salty. Told the waitress and she asked whether I'd like a free dessert because of the bad salad. I probably would've accepted except the food took a long time to come out (it wasn't crowded) and I had places to go.
Working in FiDi, I stop in to Kuu Ramen at least once every two weeks to grab a quick bowl of ramen. Great things: fast, affordable ($11 for some bowls), place to sit down, tasty. The ramen isn't extremely authentic in flavor, it still tastes good. I usually go for the Okinawa Salt Ramen which is comprised of a pleasant, not too rich broth, a heaping of curly noodles, two slices of tender pork, menma, fish cake slice, arugula and corn. Don't go for the more expensive ($14) tonkotsu - it's tastes the same as the Okinawa.  Favorites: Okinawa Salt Ramen Atmosphere: Crowded, but clean and popular! Lots of lines during lunch time Service: Self-serve Tips: If you go with a friend, have them steal a couple of open seats while you wait in line; they can fill up fast, but the turnover is quick; if it's too busy, go for to go. On weekends they have waiter service!
"Definitely deserves a 1 or a 2 star review NOT a 4 or 5 star review. I wanted to like this place and tried to talk to the chef/owner to give her a chance to make it up and she didn't, at all. The only pro was that the ribs were good.  Stay away from the oysters they were not fresh tasting, terribly shucked and thus filled with sand and grit. The yellowtail was so over cooked that we didn't even eat it after telling the chef it was rock solid and being told that ""that's how people want it in New York"", as a born and raised New Yorker I can tell you, you can do better.  The only waiter was so awkward that it made us feel uncomfortable eating there and the chef was yelling at the line cook the entire time which made it even more awkward. The chairs are old salon chairs and far too high for the tables.  This place and the chef could have potential if the chef would listen to customers attempting to give constructive criticism. She was too argumentative and defensive to even accept any feedback. Definitely don't go for a special occasion or at all until they get their act together :-/."
Let me start off by saying that this restaurant is beautifully decorated. The paintings on the wall were awesome. The customer service was great but the food was just OK in my opinion. I ordered the vegetarian tacos with a side of kale, yellow rice, and vegan black beans. The tacos were delicious but everything else was just OK. I also ordered a passionfruit margarita which was also good but a little on the weak side. One thing I was disappointed it was the maduros con queso appetizer which was baked sweet plantain with cheese and cream on top. Not good! It had a freezer burn taste. My stomach is turning just thinking about it. But the tacos made up for it. Get the tacos!
Came here based on all reviews and must say was not disappointing. Had the beef and chicken tacos, very fresh and reasonably priced.  I would have given this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the price they charge for drinks. I would definitely come back for the tacos, but next time will bring my own water.
Very good. Hidden gem great beers not an everyday selection.  Lots of organic choices on the food menu
I ordered the fritatta along with the cappuccino for brunch and it was delicious. The food was fresh and delicious. The decor was great. The only downside was we didn't get to sit outside because it was closed off. Overall experience was great!
After months of having this place on my Foursquare bucket list of places to eat- I finally checked it out. 5/5 for decor 5/5 for staff 5/5....  First of all, the staff is delightful. These guys are serious/passionate about their business. They are attentive, friendly, and handsome! I was thoroughly impressed by their friendliness and their knowledge on beer.  I ordered a mojito and a burger with truffle fries. I was in heaven. Generous portions, amazing burger. Super cute place. Can't wait to come back and try the wings!
I would honestly give this place a 3.5 stars, but I rounded down due to service. Came here one night for dinner with a few friends. I can't speak about the pho since I ordered a banh-mi but my friends seemed to enjoy their dish. The spicy brisket banh mi I got is delicious. The sandwich is pretty big, which surprised me, and the meat was so juicy and flavorful, it left me wanting more. My biggest complaint is the service here, which knocked them down. Since there was a long wait outside, they tried hurrying everyone who was eating. By the time we sat down, they already asked us what we wanted to eat. I was finished first, but my other two friends were eating. They already took my plate away and put the check on the table. It just seemed very rush and we weren't able to enjoy ourselves as much.
"We came here Saturday night before our show.  We arrived at the restaurant around 5:30 pm and was told there was a 15 minute wait, so we walked around outside until we got a text message/phone call.  All seating is upstairs and we were seated at a table.  In addition to regular bar seating and tables they have ""communal tables"" where people may be asked to sit together.  A restaurant should advertise this before a party sits down and becomes comfortable! Once we were seated, we were provided with water and menus.  The menu is straight forward, just variations of burgers and lobsters.  We ordered the original lobster roll which comes with fries and salad.  The lobster roll was so sad to say the least.  There was no flavor in the lobster.  It was overdressed. The bun was cold.  The only saving factor were the sides! And on their own they are 3$ each.  Why would I spend 25$ on a meal if I only enjoyed 6$ of it?  On a positive note, the bathroom is clean. The toilets and sinks are in the same area, but they aren't as you need to come outside to wash your hands. Extremely hygienic!  All in all, this was highly disappointing for us.  We will not be entertaining this restaurant again as we have also gone to their other location in Flat Iron and had a similar disappointing experience."
Came in on Sunday, food was great and service was slow, the man that was cutting meats was on his personal phone surfing instead of acknowledging us.  Everyone behind counter was slow and confused!  Tables were dirty and when we sat down with food, it started to get busy.  When we came in it was slow and tables could have been cleaned then.  After I finished my meal, I asked for a sample of the bread pudding, they refused and said no?  I was so offended by their response.  In ending, The food was greAt and the service was horrible. Update: After waiting right in front of the cashier who didn't even look at me and kept looking around and only speaking with his co workers, I asked to speak with a manager after I wrote this- I was referred to the person who was the one who was on his cell phone and ignoring me at the beginning before cutting the meats.  I just ask the person; cashier, why was I refused a taste of the Bread pudding and I also told him that I felt offended that I was refused.  He just said thAt it's made to order.  I just walked away.
"Laughably bad service here on Sunday. We came at the behest of one of our group who had been here previously and says the service is quite different during the weekdays.  The experience:  Half of our party of four arrived about 10min ahead of the other 2 and were let know they could not be seated before the full party arrived. That's fine; some restaurants have this policy and I'm not mad at it--I mention it merely to let everyone know this is the policy even when the restaurant is not busy/more than half-empty.  When we were seated, we were given water in a carafe and menus. Then we were left alone for more than 20min, no hyperbole. The water carafe was empty, and everyone was looking around. I asked if it was counter service instead of sit down to my friend who had been there previously as it went on so long with people who clearly worked there studiously doing anything but taking our order--scrubbing counters, filling condiments etc. a few feet away. I felt like they were trying to freeze us out but I guess we hit the waiting period mark because someone eventually took our order.  Naturally, things came out incorrectly, and we were missing items and received items we did not order. It happens, but it was just another thing. Nothing great about the food. Hummus/sandwiches/falafel were all pretty generic, baba ganoush had too much garlic. Additionally, the waitress' attitude was not what I would describe as pleasant the entire time.  The kicker was when we got the bill. We wanted to split the order--not, mind you, among a crazy amount of cards: just two, along couple/table sides. We divided the bill by item but they wanted an actual dollar amount to split. This confused two of us who are servers and wonder what POS they have, but, hey, no problem, we did the math and let them know ""$70.50 on the green card, the rest of the bill on the other."" We were very confused when the cards were returned as there was an added gratuity on one of the cards. Apparently, the waitress had heard ""70 on this card and 50 on the other"" which amounted to more than the cost of the total bill and she ran it anyway without questioning it, giving herself a gratuity. It seemed pretty clear she had done this on purpose.  Needless to say, congratulations to you if you didn't want us here because of some way we looked because we definitely won't be back. This is the only 1 star review I have ever given--your service is that bad."
A bit loud, stiff, but I like sitting under the green wall. Food offering is ok, just don't get the underwhelming grilled cheese.   Yes this review is short, ok, I'll get back to it once I have more to say about this place.
Just stopped by this place, it's closed until april. They have a small takeout location across the street, but the restaurant is closed. Disappointed since made plans to meet a few people here...
Twice as large, two floors, and yet still holds on to the original look and feel of the old Barn Joo. The Grain hasn't opened up yet but I can wait. Just a soft opening for FnF so can't say how the final place will be.
Ordered from here to a friends house nearby and got them hooked! The food is always delicious and it's awesome to know that it's the same quality even when they deliver. We got the pad thai, pad see ew, drunken noodles, and massaman curry. My friend who thought she hated curry is now a massaman curry believer--that's how delish this place is. I also love that they offer mock duck. As a vegetarian, I always get excited when I have options and Up Thai never dissapoints.  My go-to Upper East Side restaurant, hands down.
We were initially impressed by the rating good reviews, but after eating here, we wonder what the hype is all about.  First of all, we had the oysters, which were from Virginia. Maybe I'm spoiled coming from the Northeast, but they were just ok. The rock shrimp tempura was maybe the best appetizer we had. Beet salad with the burrata was fairly yummy as well.  We found the cocktails to be a bit overly sweet and not enough of the featured alcohol. We had the dark and stormy and Wallabout Sour and another one with tequila and spicy honey. We mentioned it to them, and they offered to put in an extra shot on the next round, but for an extra cost!!! On to the main meals: two of us had the roasted catch of the day, which was Porgy. It was tasty, but very hard to manage with the skin sticking a little too much to the meat, I think a result of bring a little overcooked perhaps. A bit too tender.  Side dish was u impressive- a simple melange of bean sprouts, Thai basil and some seasoning.  Ok, my sister-in-law had the seared tuna, which was very NOT happening!!! Very little flavor and the sauce just didn't work at all. We all tried a same and came to the same conclusion.  Some of the seafood dishes on the menu have meat so watch out true Pescaterians! My niece had a salmon, without the bacon, and she said it was again just ok.  Apparently, the best winner ironically are the ribs, given that this is supposed to be primarily a seafood restaurant. My Dad and other younger niece had this, and they loved it.  We decided to try the desserts, and the two nieces had vanilla ice cream which was yummy. My brother and I shared the 'ice scream Sunday' and found the presentation a bit strange - in a tall cocktail glass bit was hard to access the full range of the dessert, and there was not enough ice cream, being overwhelmed by the rest of the ingredients. Not the worst place I've been to, but definitely not a place that I would revisit I'm afraid.  One great plus though- the service was excellent and the people were very friendly!! Only wish the kitchen was on point, particularly for the price!!!
"This is an average of 1 star for service and 5 starts for food. Food is delish and filling. Service is consistently horrible based on 3 visits during busy time and slow time. It takes 20 minutes to get a drink from a bar, 20 minutes people!! That is unacceptable!!! Our food arrived 3 minutes after drinks and appetizer arrived before drinks!! No one was checking on us and if we wanted anything like another drink or a fork that was dropped we had to ""catch"" server. And this was consistent scenario over 3 visits. For the love of food I will be doing take out only from now on and if I find place with equally good food, I will not be coming back because I do not appreciate to be treated like a nuisance."
Place has gone downhill. My coffee cup was greasy and gummy, it hadn't even been washed. The food was so salty I could hardly finish it.
"Udon Noodles with tofu/vegetables: I was so excited that this place served crispy tofu. Most asian places don't have crispy tofu in this area. So you can imagine my disappointment when this ""crispy"" tofu was cold and chewy. Very underwhelming. Udon was chewy and cold as well, just overall very cold and severely lacking in flavor. I work across the street from this place but I'll probably never go back."
"The food is pretty good, but if you can't sit outside, don't even bother. The cramped cafeteria-style tables in the back are unpleasant, especially if you're at one of the several ""communal"" tables. Chairs crammed too close together, super loud music, definitely not enough room per diner/party to accommodate their giant portions. If you're coming in from elsewhere hard to believe you've made the trek for this, it's good but hardly the best restaurant around; if you're local to the UWS, save yourself the headache and get your food to go or, if possible, sit outside."
If I could give 0 stars, I would. The hostess' are ridiculous - they don't know how to seat large parties and they completely LIE when they tell you how long the wait is. Do yourself a favor and go down the block for food just as good and without the incompetent staff
There is always a line outside and a wait. Good thing there is a bar across the street. They will text you when the table is ready.  The appetizers is EVERYTHING here.  The crispy Brussels sprouts were amazing. Surprisingly packed with flavor. I also loved their agedashi tofu. The broth was done just right and they used the right toppings too. Krispy kale and pork belly bao was unique and different.  Ordered their pork bone ramen. Broth was bland and my soft boiled egg was flavorless. Texture of noodle was good. They used thick chunks of pork belly. Confused as to the kind of veggies they used (had a pickled taste) so it changed the taste of my broth slightly  Solid 3.5 stars. will return to eat the apps again but not the ramen.  It's too trendy and American style.
Came here with a group of friends after work expecting some really amazing food. I've always heard really great things about Filipino food and was so excited to finally get to try it myself plus we heard off of yelp that they had a pretty good happy hour.  To start off we ordered some Parmesan fries and they were pretty good. It came with some interesting ketchup but I thought it matched well.  I ordered a seafood dish with some kind of pasta and I really didn't not enjoy it. It was very salty and I wasn't crazy about it at all. (I attached a photo since I can't seem to remember the name) The service was great and our waiter was attentive but I unfortunately wouldn't try this spot again.
Best grilled Mexican style corn I have ever had in the US, though it is not as juicy and not using mayonnaise and cheese spread compare to the one in Mexico City. Ordered the coconut flan and pork taco as well, nothing bad to say about the flan and pork meat is tender and moist. Small restaurant, so it will be crowd and noisy most of the time. But everything is great if you want something for afternoon bite. I am going back for other choices on the menu.
Okay I guess this is so far one of my bets Bahn Mi experiences in my life. I ordered the JoJu monster, which I kinda regret but I could still tell that JoJu's Bahn Mi sandwiches are really amazing. The reason why I did not like what I ordered was because I did not really like meat inside of the sandwich. It tasted too strong for me and this ham was definitely something that I've never tried before. Because of this unfamiliar taste, I did not really like my sandwich but I still want to give 4 starts to JoJu for the quality of food they make. I really liked the baguette they use and except for the meat part, I liked the sandwich I got.   So if you are like me, who is not familiar with this distinct taste of Vietnamese ham, I recommend you to order something else. That is what I am going to to next time I visit this place. Also, kimchi fries were very delicious. As Korean, I wonder how this Vietnamese restaurant would use kimchi (which is a traditional korean food) for their own menu. Surprisingly, it went really well with french fries and my boyfriend and I fell in love with it. I definitely recommend you to get this! You won't regret.
THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU ORDER EXTRA HOT. I'm not joking. And coincidentally, I came here on the hottest day of the year. Saturday night, there was a short wait after you put your name on the board by the door. The restaurant is not that roomy; with about 8 seats along the bar and a few tables for groups of 4 and 2.  My boyfriend and I have been anticipating this meal for the whole week. We really wanted to try Nashville Hot Chicken -- to the point that we were about to drive down to Nashville to eat. We shared the barbecue shrimp and extra hot chicken. We paired it with mac&cheese and also had two additional sides: asparagus and collard greens.  The barbecue was not the same as we tried in NOLA, but flavor was so good that there was no complaint. The shrimp was cooked to perfection, if it was cooked any longer, it would've been bad. The fried grits were amazing, paired really well with the tangy barbecue and peppers. You can't eat here without trying this! Easily became one of my favorite dishes. The hot chicken arrived a little after we finished the shrimp. It comes with 3 different pieces (wing, drumstick, breast) The sides may look small, but there's actually a lot! I'm so glad I tried the sides before I ate the chicken because well... after that, I couldn't eat anything else. Mac& cheese included my favorite crispy edges. The asparagus was cooked simple and it goes well with the chicken. Lightly salted.  THE CHICKEN: The bartender gave us a disclaimer when we ordered. There's ghost pepper on Extra Hot. First bite is okay... Then it hits you once you finish chewing. The chicken itself was very moist and tender. It wasn't heavily battered, and had a really flaky skin. My tongue was on fire, I drank so much water to get rid of the burn but nothing helped. Next time i'm having medium. I was so disappointed that a single piece of chicken ruined my meal. One helluva experience! Oh and my boyfriend ate the rest and survived.
Late review, came here two years ago after work!!( trying to remember the places I don't want to visit again!) It gets over crowded with worker bees. So it might take a while to get a table. It's nice to be on water but other than that there's nothing too special
When we walked and there was no one to receive us at the door. When we finally found someone, she was rude and obnoxious. The food was disgusting, watered down beans and under-cooked fish. We returned 2 of the 4 dishes we ordered. Then as I we were walking out, a cork from a bottle flew in front of my face almost hitting someone. It was a bartender opening a bottle of sparkling wine. It was a bizarre almost surreal experience, like being in the twilight zone. Needless to say, I'm not going back.
"The staff here couldn't find their rear end with both hands if their lives depended on it. Essentially the restaurant opened up the outside tables without bringing on extra help and the sole waiter was left running around trying to keep too many plates spinning and failing miserably. It took too long to take our drink orders, too long to take our food orders and by the time the food came out the fried chicken sandwich was room temperature. The two eggs over easy were so cold you could have chilled the drinks with it and the Eggs ""Baltimore"" had sat under the heating lamp so long that if I'd dumped them into a sock I could have mugged all the tourists in the place.  When I complained, they swore they'd take the price of the food off the final bill and then failed to perform this minor courtesy.  Couldn't actually tell you if anything tasted good because what's the point of eating a hard boiled egg when you're supposed to get a poached egg.  En attendant the food I ordered several cocktails and suppose that the alcohol had been added, but I can't say for sure considering how sober I was when I left the restaurant on an empty stomach.  All in all an excellent experience if you want to spend money and not actually get anything you paid for."
The broth is unreal at this popular ramen spot. A lot of Japanese spoken here from the servers to the chefs. Makes it feel authentic but I also thought it was just a little loud. Obviously, the ramen is the star here. They have a variety of ramen to choose from, but the classic should be the first thing someone has to get an idea of what the place has to offer. As with many ramen spots in the city, it can get pricey for a bowl of noodles. With that being said, I can't help but not mention that the broth seems to be prepared with a ton of care so the price may be justified to those who appreciate a good bowl of noodle soup. Would definitely like to go again to try some of their other ramen choices.
This Place Had Great Jazz Music And Would Be A Nice Place For Me To Go Near My Apartment On The Conner Of 110 And I Live On 106th. But The Only Problem Is They Discriminate My Color! I've Been 2 Times To See If It Was True. YES! Still In 2017  People Will Try To Make You Feel Less Important. I Know There Is One Black Guy Who Sits At The Bar All The Time In Have Drinks. But He's In Another World!  I've Been To So Many Places In My Life Time. To Know When I Walk Into A Place And No One Greets Or Say Welcome? That's Not A Good Sign. Even The Bartender Was Busy I Can See After Waiting On Her To Take My Drink Order. She Didn't Even Let Me Know The Had Drink Specials? So I Order One Of There Highest Price Wines. To Let Her Know I'm Not Cheap! And Gave Her A Great Tip. After Sitting For 5 Mins Some Guy Walks In I Can See The Difference Right Away. She Says Hi And Let's Him Know We Have A Happy Hour Special And Blah Blah Blah. Unbelievable  But True. I've Give This Place Two Chances Still The Same Treatment ! 1 Star Stands (A Manager Asked Me To Removed This Review Because Its The Wrong Place She Says? Sorry, I Know It's 4 Blocks From My Apartment! I'm Not Crazy To Write A Review On The Wrong Place. With 10s And 10s Of Thousands Of Readers.
A surprise. Difficult to find such a good and genuine barbecue place around. They have their own housemade sauces and sides are delicious as well. Also they provide more bread, if needed. Artisanal beers available, in a comfy and taverna-style environment. The only black spot: the price, a bit. Kinda expensive. But the quality of food and the perfect cooking time made everything worth it. Great place, especially with friends.
Decent food at a decent price. However, there is one employee here who I cringe to see. Every time I go here and he's working the counter I know he will not give me a seat if I get there before my male counterpart. Funny enough though, any time my male counterpart gets there first he gets seated no problem even though I am not there yet. I get it if you have a policy to seat only if everyone is there, but this person does not apply it equally.  Today was a rainy night so there were plenty of tables open when I looked around. The employee sat me at the front of the restaurant and I was amazed I got to sit before my other party was there. But I made the mistake of asking for a menu, because when I did the employee dismissively told me as he walked away - that that is not a real table, when your other party gets here then you will sit at a table. He said it so rudely like I was not even worth his time - I was so shocked.  I can get past the annoying fact that my male counterpart always gets seated even though his whole party is not there, while I never get seated even if he is less than a minute away. Why can't I have a menu?? Am I not even allowed to look at a menu without everyone present? Later, when I talked to the manager (Terry) and explained to him what happened, the manager began to mansplain about how it was likely a misunderstanding. I asked if he would speak to his employee about the way he handles customers, which he said he would, but I am not sure the message got through.
Average at best. It appears that you need to order the half chicken (which looked good although we didn't order it) to get the experience others rave about on Yelp.  I got the authentic chicken soup. It was good, but cold. My dad got one of the chicken specials. It turned out to be $12 of chicken fried rice. No side. Just a giant plate of fried rice with chicken and scrambled egg. So. Server was nice but so slow. So slow. Took over 5 minutes to first come to the table. And at 8 pm on a Saturday night, the place was empty.  Lots of eateries on 8th Street. You'll be fine skipping this one.
The ambience here is great. It has a real homie feel with great lighting. The service was fantastic.  The eggplant was 5 stars. It was very flavorful.  The tie die pizza was 4.5 stars. It has the vodka sauce with both pesto and fresh mozzarella...very tasty.  The mini rice balls were good not great-3.5 stars.  The spaghetti and meatballs was also good not great-3.5 stars.  Caesar salad was a 3-very average and nothing special about it. Overall great experience and pretty good food.
Came here with a friend during July 4th and was super impressed by the quality of food here! The fried chicken is cooked exceptionally well, with a very crispy, savory skin and juicy, tender meat. Overall, the chicken was well seasoned and not overall salty, which is a huge peeve I have for fried chicken. Also ordered were the fried fish and a series of sides, including greens, beans and Mac and cheese. The fried fish, although very savory, was flaky, piping hot and delicious. All sides definitely did not disappoint and were hard to not finish.  In addition to the upfront restaurant seating, there's also a back, semi open space which is a bit quieter and more laid back. Personally, it's a great option if you're looking to catch up with friends and chat a bit more.  Unfortunately, we were too full during our visit to order any dessert, but given how much I loved the meal, I'd definitely go back again for both.
Came after good reviews but got disappointed. Food is ok but nothing surprising.  I always go for  lamb and tried it made in the oven with veggies.  The meat was not soft enough and the plate only brought a few pieces. The grilled octopus was better but  under average.  Tzatziki was good.
Best soup dumplings in NYC. All the tourists know about it now which makes the line longer. Good thing I'm a regular so I don't have to wait!
Eh, nothing special.  After reading all the five star reviews, I was sure this place would be a hit.  We had the fish tacos, stir fried rib eye and and the cevice mix.  The tacos were tasty, cevice was ok, and the rib eye was terribly chewy.  You'll probably have better luck with the skirt steak.
"Agreeing with the person who said they broke a glass and couldn't get any drinks after. We were literally talking and accidentally hit down a glass. Waiter said they couldn't serve another drink because ""their being watched"". We paid a $300 bill, why couldn't we get another drink? Never going back."
"We went to Becco yesterday, Sunday 18 June 2017, party of 5 at 3:30pm...we had previously dined at Becco a year ago and it was wonderful...Sadly, yesterday was an awful experience. First, we were one of only a few occupied tables at the time...thus no excuse for our first bad experience...slow service. Second, our entire table ordered the signature ""unlimited"" 3 Pasta Dishes...with Antipasto appetizer, the Antipasto for 5 was barely sufficient for 2-3 people, and it was oily and ordinary. Third, the second pasta dish, a fettuccine, was not mixed at all, so most of us received a serving of dry, sticky fettuccine with no sauce...unedible. Fourth, my daughter asked our server to wait to give her third pasta until she finished the first two on her plate...he didn't come back with her first ""unlimited"" pasta for almost 30 minutes, despite asking a few times...by that time we were all done...and so disappointed we just wanted to leave. Note to Becco Mgt...your quality control failed.  You should have been at your best for Father's and Families, especially as it was at a time when only a few people were at your restaurant, before the busy time started at 5pm! Now, I'm sorry to say Becco is no longer a consideration for a wonderful Italian dining experience for my family and friends."
Service was poor. Had a reservation at 10 pm for two months, arrived on time, and still had to wait 30 minutes. The hostesses were unfriendly.  The food was just average. Had the rigatoni diablo; it was ok but nothing special. Had the agnolotti and it was ok, but again nothing short of mediocre.  For the money you will spend at Lilia, I would recommend a dozen other places in NYC where you'll get better service and better food.  At a certain price point, a restaurant should feel obligated to provide outstanding service and food. In the case of Lilia I give the food. B- and the service a C-   I like eating at restaurants that leave me feeling that no matter how hard I try, I could not re-create the meal in my home kitchen. At Lilia, I don't think anything I ate had that special quality. Everything we ate could easily be re-created at home for 1/10 of the price.
Very good steak --- not greatest! The quality of the cut is second to none! The restaurant is packed to the max so get ready to wait even if you have reservation. I liked the ambience --- Bavarian rustic style with Eastern European waiters, nice guys! But there is a certain arrogance from the front desk while you ask for your table and wait. I was very excited to come to this restaurant because all the hype and because I am a steak lover! We had the bacon and salads for appetizer --- delicioiooouuusss!. Main entree it was steak for 3 medium and steak for 2 rare, onion rings, house potatoes and creamy spinach. Everything came out good but our medium steak was basically rare and not as juicy as expected. I have to admit that I was surprised because restaurants like this are usually on point with everything. I personally think that Wolfgang's steak house in Manhattan is better (the  owner was the manager of Peter Luger for many years). Anyway, it was a great night surrounded by friends and great food! I strongly suggest you to try this restaurant and make your own conclusions.
I guess I was not sure what to expect when I entered but the flavors were not great. The meat was overcooked and whatever sauce they used was bland and not something I would want more of. Maybe it was because I was not super hungry when I went there but it is not something I would bring a visitor if they only have 15 meals in NYC.
"I love me some southern food.. And never once have I ever had a fried chicken sandwich that was smothered in MAYO. I'm giving them a star for their quality of chicken, a half star for the fact that they have tots.. And another half star from my fellow deliveree that said the bologna sandwich was solid.. But MAYO?? Seriously? You sold it as a ""buttermilk dressing"" on caviar and it was effing mayo.  Let's not even get into the disgustingness of the corn bread. Save your money guys, it's the grossest corn bread I have ever chewed and spit into the garbage in my life. Two peanut butter cups later and my mouth is still haunted by the taste of it. The slaw was not so good either, so unless you're drunk and just want to mask the taste of the MAYO on your sandwich, it's not worth it."
I usually love this place and I always bring friends so they can check it out. But today I come in with my friend and the first things she saw, was the counter guy digging his bare hands into the food bins and eating. Licking his fingers and putting them back in the salad bins. I tell the other counter guy to make him stop but he tells me it's ok my food ain't coming from there. Now we are both telling him that we are ordering salads and to stop him from snacking from the bins. THE GUY JUST KEEPS EATING AND STARING AT US. Of course we walked out and googled the health departments number.
I have nothing but nice things to say about Cafe Habana. I always go to the bar and talk up Deivy. He is so nice and always makes me feel right at home. The mix between Mexican and Cuban cuisine works really well. If you go, please try the corn. It will change your life. I also always get the frozen margaritas with guava. The place is not big or fancy, but it has heart. I like how casual it is and there is something on the menu for everyone. Service is friendly and quick, on a Sunday evening. Waits can be long during weekends and peak dinner hours, so plan accordingly.
What a good Cuban sandwich I had! One of the best the city has to offer. In kind of a desolate part of Brooklyn, but definitely worth the trip. Also tried The chicken rice and beans bowl which was good, but nothing new. Go there and get the Cuban it's worth the trip.
I just came here for brunch and the maitre d' (who I think was the owner by the way she treated us) was very nice and accommodating. I am not a pork eater but the fried pork chop (which I got because they said the buttemilk chicken was only offered for dinner) was very good. The cheddar waffle was also good although I was disappointed to see that it was only half of a belglan waffle (the amount of food was sufficient but since the menu didn't say half then of course I was expecting the full thing like most other places. I think this should be stated under the entree description.) My dining partner had the short-rib which they were very happy with (I tasted it and also thought it was very good). We got biscuits on the side which were filling but rather plain and dense- I could have done without these. Overall we had a very good meal with courteous and timely service; I would recommend it.
A friend of my dragged me here to try their renowned hand-pulled noodles. While the noodles were great, the portion was perfect, it didn't wow me. Don't let this deter you-- my taste buds veer away from oily tasting soups this day but on another I might enjoy it a lot! Price wise definitely worth it and a great stop in Chinatown; felt very mom and pops from China and I felt quite comfortable in the authentic-feeling environment
Really delicious, hard-to-find food.  Service was a bit spotty, but decor, ambience, and quality of food make up for it enough that I would definitely come back.  Try the duck confit croquettes!
"VERY DISAPPOINTING LUNCH Ordered the Mexican Style Grilled Corn which came quickly and was just OK. Sweeter corn with larger kernels is available in any nearby supermarket in season. We ordered a side of guacamole, steak and corn salad, and the shrimp tacos. The restaurant wasn't crowded, but at least 7 other customers at 3 tables who had ordered well after us received their food before we did. When we asked the waitress about where our food was, she replied ""I don't know.""  After another 10 minute wait with no food, we paid for the corn appetizer and left. On the way out, we watched as the waitress explained to the chef why we were leaving. I will not return due to the lousy service."
Looked this place on yelp.. was so excited to try it...struggling to get there parking was crazy hard... got there walked in with plenty of empty tables and the host didn't want to seat us???? He said there were no tables for 5 people.. I offered we would split up..He was very rude to say the least.. so we smiled and walked out.. This was my first time ever visiting New York.  My husband, my elderly mother, 2 teenaged girls, and my self...
The food is excellent, but the delivery service was always poor, now it's non-existent. So many times they told us they couldn't deliver that day because they were busy or someone didn't show up. Tonight they told they don;t deliver any more because 'the delivery guy quit on me 2 days ago'. This place is not worth the hassle, despite the good food when you actually go there,
My boyfriend wanted to go for his birthday so I knew it had to be good. We went during a weeknight and, with a reservation, were seated immediately. We sat by the Yakitori grill which is a bar style set up where you're seated with strangers. The restaurant is very small and intimate but beautifully decorated.  We ordered a few items from the yakitori menu to start - the chicken skin, short rib, shishito peppers and chicken thigh. They're cooked very simply on bamboo skewers with a light char and a light sauce.  We also ordered the Negi Tori Don which is grilled chicken over scallions & rice - it also come with a runny egg that I opted-out of. The entree wasn't visually appealing but was DELICIOUS! The chicken is cooked in a spicy, sweet sauce that could make anything taste good. The Yakitori items weren't anything to rave about but I would go back for the Negi Tori Don.
Second time around reconfirms my first time here. Entirely overpriced and underwhelming. There are ample alternatives to this place, I would hit up Taqueria in the E. Village (Formerly LES) 100% of the time over this place from here on out.  I would hit up there and Mayahuel as great alternatives to this sub-par pricey joint. And I say this begrudingly as I'm normally a douchey upturned nosey snob about things. In this case the price point similar to how crappy Nello is doesn't justify the quality or flavor of food, it just screams that we are a two story establishment and need to hike up prices in light of how high our rent is.
Came here on a Sunday afternoon for a small girls brunch. I've been here before but it feels like every time I come, it's a new experience. My party of four (five if you include baby and stroller) were told the wait time would be about 20mins. Trust me, for a Sunday afternoon brunch, a 20 minute wait is NOTHING. So we stood outside on the lovely day and waited for our table. Unfortunately twenty minutes turned into 45. I guess it didn't bother us as much because we're used to long brunch wait times. But when you haven't eaten breakfast and also have a an infant with you, the wait can start to bring out the aggregation. Anyway, we were seated and our server Joe creeped up on us (heeeey cutie patootie). He greeted us and took our orders. It all went with ease (what a relief).  They must have these plates ready and waiting because, let me tell you, I blinked twice and my food was in front of me. Plate hot and everything pretty (God bless our servers. Honestly. Truly.). I took a bite and my soul left my body, kissed Jesus on the forehead, descended down into my lifeless flesh, then revived me.  The French toast threw my life's current troubles into the sea of forgetfulness. The chorizo made me she'd a very real tear. The fluffy eggs were fluffed by the prophet Muhammed himself, and my potatoes were baked in the sun.  I say this all to say that I was happy, fulfilled, and saved. I'll be back to Peaches. Have all of my money. Yes.  #dropsmic #proceedstopraisebreak #halleluuuooooshando
We walked in and were warmly greeted and seated by the host during happy hour (4-7pm). At 6pm, the place was already crowded, but we were able to snag the last bar table.  The server came over and took our drink orders promptly. When she returned with drinks, I noticed we didn't have a food menu. At that time, I asked her for one, which she brought. Unfortunately, she didn't return to our table for over 25 minutes (pretty sure there was one server for entire bar area). By the time she did, we no longer had time for food.  The happy hour wine was decent at at $7/glass is in line with other area happy hours. They also had craft beer on special for $5. They offer happy hour cocktails; however, I'm not sure what the discount is (they're normally $15).  It's pricey ($$$), but I'll definitely be back to try the food - everything we saw looked great.
I loved this place! It's great that they offer 3 different Asian cuisines: Vietnamese, Thai and Malaysian. I ordered laksa and it was super tasty! The soup was very well-seasoned and they gave me a lot of seafood! I also got a dish of dumplings for free (I think it was because I checked in on Yelp) and that was delicious also. Some people said the peanut sauce was overpowering but I loved it! Will come back again!
Great service very attentive but the food ...  the lasagna didn't have any flavor at all and the cavelli was mostly sauce
The nachos was OK. I had better one at Iguana. The drinks were OK, my friend says his chicken  enchilada was good and his fuzzy bunny was peachyrific, whatever that means. Overall it is an OK place.
Great place for Thai food near the Hell's Kitchen area. Best time to come here is early in the evening or prob late night. Came here at around 4 on a Friday evening, good number of seats available. Got the crab and pork dry noodles as everyone had recommended; though it was different with the dry noodles I didn't think it was that good in comparison to the hype.  The chicken puffs and the vegetable dumplings were quite good on the contrary and had very unique flavors. Good place to come for a slightly different type of Thai cuisine but not really worth the wait.
"I have been a fan of sea for the past 9 years. The food was fantastic at first but over the years I have noticed a steady decline in the quality.  I didn't make a big deal of this and still visited, not as frequent but I still did.  What happened to me and my family on the 4th of July was not only disrespectful and a major violation but also unforgivable.  After the fireworks my family and I walked 20 mins in the rain to sea. Yes, it was late and I co Vince's them to give it one more shot. We got here and the Wait was another hour. We stayed.  We were seated and the waited took about 15 minutes to come to our table. It's get worse. We order and the food took another 45 minutes to arrive. Not only want did they forget a few items but the food was cold and inedible.  It gets better.  I went to the front as asked to speak to the manager. He brush me off and his response was "" It is a busy night."" His level of nonchalance tipped, EXPERT LEVEL.  I looked around and the restaurant was half full. The cashier was laughing at me, I felt alone, on the outside of an inside joke.  I will no longer spend my money in this establishment because of the level of inconsideration and disrespect. Shit happens. Orders gets messed up. It's life. To have that dismissive attitude and not give a sincere apology or not act like you give an once of care is NOT acceptable.  I wish you guys all the best and if you keep it up then sea will dry up and all that will be left is rock bottom."
"May be my last time here. Quality and service are not up to par. Tipped them over 20% for just BECAUSE. Going back to your mother, ""Traif""."
Great outdoor space for catching up with a friends, a cold drink, or live entertainment but NOT the food. I wished the chicken tacos with green magic sauce and pickled shallots on corn tortillas ($4) would disappear. What a joke! It lacked flavor and needed a few ingredients to even be worth the listed price. The grilled cheese with taleggio, lavender honey & fried rosemary on sourdough ($9) was way overdone. Now I know why the bar was to the immediate left of the entrance and the food truck was tucked away in the back. You can play or sway all night long, but I'll just say that Sunday was not a good day for Nowadays.
Don't know how much this restaurant pays the papers to be 'best of' in anything, but ongoing it online as one of the top ten to have a veggie burger 50 min trek later, we get there only to have the staff inform us that they don't make the patty, its readymade !? Food: really sub par burger, served with one piece of wilted lettuce and one ring of onion. They charge you extra if you want cheese on your burger btw The worst Cole slaw ever, no taste at all and no mayo  Chicken tacos, very ok taste, no filling except for chicken pieces Drink: beer choice is v limited, iced tea was w honey, and the lemonade was good but expensive at 4 dollars Overall: would not return, I hate wilted veggies and for the portion size and taste, it's a total miss, sorry
I do not get the appeal of the Smith. Overpriced and under quality food, plus you'll always find yourself waiting for a long time before you eat!  I came here on a few different occasions and every time I wound up waiting at least 45 min for a table for 2. Come on, seriously?  Once you are seated, there's nothing on the menu that's really outstanding. I've had the burger here and it's over cooked and clearly overpriced. I left hungry.  Hot potato chips were okay but it's a small portion for $9 Chicken Pot Pie is bland and more importantly there is not enough crust!  In general, the restaurant is way too loud (seriously, acoustics were rough), it takes forever to get the server's attention for anything (INCLUDING getting the check.. which may explain why you wait so long for a table), and the food is only mediocre. Pass
The Quick: Incredible tacos on handmade tortillas (you can watch them make!) using fresh ingredients at a fairly reasonable price. Standing room only.  The Details: I like to live my life like every day is taco Tuesday. The tacos are all fresh and delicious, overflowing with toppings such as guacamole and fresh herbs. There really isn't much seating, so perfect for a quick bite, not really a date and not for a big group.  The Damage: ~ $4 per taco
Egh... It wasn't bad. It wasn't what reviews had me anticipating either. I absolutely love African food. Ordered the fish meal and the texture was all off. Very mushy. The sauce was cool but overall it (I'm a big sauce person) and the meal in general were nothing to write home about. Texture was really a problem for me. Flavor was decent for sure but not spectacular. In fairness I've only been there once and I feel that going somewhere at least twice paints a more accurate picture.
The hunt for lobster value has ended! 1lb lobster with claw meat is plenty for lunch and it's only $20! A side salad and fries are the perfect partners to satisfy your hunger for body and soul. I love the modern concept and focused menu for burger and lobster lovers. The four friends who came up with this clearly found a void in the market that is universal. I haven't tried the burger yet but it will be my next venture at my neighborhood location.  The drinks menu is also perfect for after work meet ups which you snack on some fare.
So there is Pardon My French  (a great place) and this place... my gag reflex was in overdrive and I left partially hungry. It's a French tapas place with mediocre food. We tried the Brussel sprouts, duck confit, croque, sliders, and scallops. The croque and sliders were great but considering how subpar everything else was, I may just be desperate. Great service but go somewhere else for food.
i'm super confused as to why this place is so popular. Is a sexy room and fairly good chicken enough to sustain an empire for this long.?! BTW- the chicken is no where near locanda verde's or Anella's in Brooklyn  The drinks were a joke although they get points for offering local craft beer on tap.  The pastas were mediocre (the orchiette was bland and the crab pasta was overpowered with glue-like cream)  burrata was gross - sour .  Goat entree and side of greens were incredibly salty. The side of potatoes were a collection of fried grease bits - maybe three pieces of proper potato on the dish and the waitress was obnoxious when i confronted her about it.  we skipped dessert - everyone just wanted to get out of there. Overall, $525 for 5 people without dessert and one alcoholic drink each.  This place has jumped the shark
"My wife and I were super excited to try this place out after seeing at show at St. Ann's Warehouse.  And gosh, is the interior charming. But boy, is the food mediocre. We spent $100 for two of us with an appetizer and salad and two entrees, no booze. Not that this would be so terrible or even remarkable at a great NYC restaurant. But this is simply not one of them. The flavor profile of the pork was simply ""salt"" and that of the chicken was ""salt water."" The salmon croquettes were *okay* and the cabbage salad was forgettable.  The service was pleasant and quick -- no complaints there. But as for the food: not good and perhaps even more damning: wildly overpriced."
I had high hopes for this place based off the good reviews but I was pretty underwhelmed.  There was no wait for a table of 2 on a Thursday night but the restaurant was very packed! We dined downstairs where it is more quiet. -Calamari salad - I actually really enjoyed this salad. Fried calamari over a bed of argula!  -Mushroom ravioli - oversauced. The raviolis were huge but it had mainly dough and not enough filling.  -My friend had the fettuccine with shrimp - I enjoyed her dish more. Not over sauced and it didn't overwhelm the dish. However, shrimp was slightly underdone.
Best Mexican restaurant in NYC. Extremely good food, fresh clean cocktail and friendly stuff. Go!
Food was really great. Waiter was very below average and the manager was beyond obnoxious. Wouldn't recommend this place as there are so many places to get equally good food without the terrible service.
"Without a doubt it's a awesome place: food is great and the ambience is phenomenal. However, the service is definitely unfavorable. I had reservations for my birthday  and after waiting more than 30 mins my friend asked the hostess how much longer until we would be seated and she told her, ""You need to learn how to be patient."" I've never heard such thing from a hostess before. Moreover, after enjoying our food we asked a waiter to take a picture for us and flat out said no and walked away! Another first! I get it this is a famous place but there's no room for rude service!"
Would try it, but the fact that they only take American Express cards, as the non cash option, makes me just want to dump a juicy deuce in the chefs floppy hat!
"When Baluchi's closed we were very disappointed since we love Indian food. Today, we decided to give QB a try. We're glad we did! I'm giving it 4 stars for the following reasons: 1. Great food. Inventive, interesting, and tasty. My husband and I had the shrimp/avocado ceviche which was outstanding but needs a spoon so you can serve it better; and the fried avocado which came with two delicious dips. For the main course, we had the arugula pizza which we really enjoyed. 2. As others have mentioned, they have a well stocked bar. We each got a mojito which was quite good but I was a little surprised that it had a sour mix in it. I guess Cabana has spoiled me forever as the definitive place for an authentic mojito.  3. My only caution was regarding the key lime pie for dessert. Cleverly served in a small silver bowl, it was hard to figure out what it was. Topped with a swirl of key lime - I think? - whipped cream, it sat in an overly sweet and heavy crust. The first 3 bites were heavenly; after that, I wanted to throw up. It was waaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy too sweet. Worse, they didn't have coffee or tea which I desperately needed to wash it down. I ended up not eating most of it. It would serve 2-3 people easily. 4. Additionally, the seats are certainly not ""cushy for the tushy."" You have your choice of a hard wood bench, hard wood chair, or a metal chair. All three are uncomfortable. I can only imagine that the owners don't want people to linger. I get that. But still.  5. The wait staff was professional and attentive. Our glasses were regularly filled with water and the pace of the delivery of food was just right. We didn't feel rushed or feel as though our server forgot about us. Overall, it's a great restaurant. I would take someone from out of town there. I hope it stays in business for a long time."
Came here for lunch during restaurant week.  The place is gorgeous!   We sat on the French side.  Ordered from the prefixed menu.  Before I continue, I must add that our waiter was amazing.  I wish I had remembered his name to give him full kudos.   Back to the food.   Soup:  Farro,chickpea and white bean.    Soup was DELICIOUS.  Problem was it wasn't hot.  If I had to guess it was  because it came served in the most beautiful, delicate bowl that dissipated every ounce of heat within seconds.  Salad:  Crispy shrimp, mixed grains and citrus dressing.   Salad was good with the exception of some bits that should have been tossed instead of thrown in.  No one wants to eat the pieces of greens that were meant for the garbage.  The shrimp were a nice size but fried.  Meh.  The dressing was good.  Dessert - almond cake with pears and sorbet.  - homerun.  I'd love to come back here sans restaurant week.
5 for pizza, 4 for price No doubt pizza is amazing, a little too pricey for my taste. Probably would only go to the flagship Moore St. location for special occasions. But, I would go out of my way to get Roberta's at Madison Square Eats & Broadway Bites, where all their pizzas are $3 cheaper BEE STING $17 Girlfriend approved. The honey drizzle is unique. Sweet salty crunch meat yum.  MARGEHIRTA $12 I prefer this. Classic tomato basil clean. Usually like $10 at Broadway Bites Herald Square! Location has a to-go side where they handle pickups/deliveries and a separate restaurant/bar side. Restaurant side has plenty of space, bar is really small lol. No reservations so get there early, expect a wait!
The drinks are excellent if a bit pricey.  The vibe is good and service is great but the food is crazy, tourist trap, overpriced (jamon/empanadas) for what it is.  You could easily have just a good time at Harbor House next door and keep some cash in your pocket.
The service in here is extremely extremely slow. Took 15 min for your drinks to come, 45 min to get your appetizers. Don't come here if you don't have at least 2 or 3 hours to spare. I would give this place a zero star if I could. We have been sitting here for 1 hour and 45 min and our entrees (which are fried chicken, chicken with waffle, salad, and pan-seared fish) have not arrived to our table yet! We won't come back ever again.
The food is good as it's an order, slop together and sit type joint with a table number. Sauces are awesome but the wait in line is a bit ridiculous. They have only 4 guys working the service counter and if they just put in some hustle or opened up some additional registers they wouldn't have this issue. After all that and having 3 beers while waiting in line I have to say that the meat was tasty. I tried everything and it was all so very good. I will return with friends, I just hope we can all get to eat before we get really drunk with line beers.
Okay so lemme start by saying we have been here a bunch of times. Tonight we walked by and wanted to eat, when we walked in the hostess looked bothered Bc I asked how long the wait was. So we left and did some Shopping. Went back and lemme tell you FOUR open tables and got told 45 min wait with an attitude and puss on her face. For starters, this was our GO TO PLACE WE LOVED IT, however, after this experience w staff we won't even bother going back. Sweet chick was a very nice comfy place to go. However the hostess acted too pretentious for her own good. I get it we alll have bad days or busy days, however, don't be rude and miserable. I am writing this review and keep in mind we didn't even eat there tonight. We walked over to meatball shop. I am hoping management sees this though Bc they need to get their staff in check.
Ah-mazing! We did the tasting menu and each course was better than the previous one. All the reviews on the ravioli and risotto was spot on. Ended the meal with several different desserts to taste from with everyone being better than the previous.  Our waitress was friendly and explained everything . Will definitely come back
"I'll be rating my experience mainly on the service because I believe it makes up 75% of your experience and leaves a bigger impression than anything else. The view from the roof top gets 5 stars, probably the only reason it'll stay relevant (& of course the hotel) and the food and drinks get 4 stars.  In a nut shell... (if you don't care to read on) -don't expect service to be helpful, review menu prior -expect to be treated like you're in NYC... jerk -go with very close friends, you'll be sitting on each others lap and for great company to amuse you -pay cash, the staff is ""too pretty"" to understand credit card transactions properly -go on a weekday... can't imagine the chaos on weekends. Making reservations for a party of 8 for this venue on a weeknight was difficult in its. The young lady on the phone couldn't give me a final answer in wether they'd be able to accommodate my guests. Finally, we settle on a party of 6 and I had to ""re-evaluate"" the guest list. When I arrived, the rooftop was half empty. Figured it would fill in by the time we left, since it was only 7:30. I was wrong. We left a little after 11ish and there was still plenty of available seats. Not as empty as I first arrived, but not as busy as the host said it would be while I tried reserving a table.  I was third to arrive, being the host and all, my two first guests had already been seated which was nice of then since most places wait for the entire party. The host ushered her hand in the air and said you can find your party behind this wall. Thought it was a little rude since the layout is set up like a mini maze and darkly light, similar to candle light. Since it took me some time to find my party the Maitre'd chased down till I got to my table and gave me a ""look."" My guess is because it must of looked as if I just walked right in and was helping myself to a table no reservation. Didn't even bother to approach me, just stared. Every other couple/party was shown to their table.  I reserved for 6 people and we were sat at the lounge area which sat 4 people. Two seats and a small couch for two. When I reminded the waiter about the other three guests he blatantly said ""you need to speak to the Maitre D or you can grab chairs"", as he pointed to the empty seats opposite of us. I chose not to speak to maitre d because was walking Aimlessly in circles and looked frazzled, which he continued to do the entire night. I simply added an extra chair and three of my friends squeezed on the small couch for two. So yet again, I was found their their job.  Our waiter wasn't very experienced with the menu. When asked about certain items/cocktails he literally read the description. It was as if he memorized the menu word for word. I must say that all of the employees at Will Vale are attractive. So it's understandable why no one was of help. They had lack of experience in hospitality. But something tells me they weren't going for a certain image.  Long story short it was a fun get together. Waited awhile for the drinks but once they came we had a blast! The view is breathe taking! Highly recommend it for that alone!!!  Ps. We split the bill 3 different ways and the waiter managed to charge each credit card 2 times, two different amounts. But he only gave us one receipt to sign. So that was a nice surprise the next day. :)"
With all the hype about how great their pie and fried chicken are, i definitely cannot miss out this place as a big fan of fried chicken! Result turned out to be... meh~ My standard for good fried chicken might be high, but I feel like it is reasonable. It has to be crunch, juicy, and well seasoned. The best piece to rate it from would be from the breast meat.  Don't get me wrong though, chicken tastes good and fresh. Seasoning is very average... overall just average! There is not much I could say! Chicken breast is not hard, but just not impressive enough. Being a very common dish that one could get anywhere, it is even harder to really get it done right.
The food is very good- I have been here more than once but I will never return because our wait staff this evening  was Terrible Terrible Terrible. I will not get into the details. ( this happened upstairs on 9/22 at about 7pm ) But he was unprofessional and condescending to say the least. There are other reviews here of terrible service  - so think again.
Went on the Monday before valentines, i  have been looking forward to trying Gato for a while since i am a big fan of Bobby Flay! We shared the PAELLA- (5 out of 5)- great flavors $32 for a small portion though :( SCRAMBLED EGGS (0 out of 5)- sooo salty, i only ordered because of high yelp ratings for it, maybe bad batch. Do not recommend. Felt stupid paying that much for bad eggs.  CAULIFLOWER AND BRUSSELS SPROUTS- (3 out of 5) Nothing bad, nothing special Decor and Service were great though, but i still cant help but feel cheated out of $100 hard earned bucks. Our waiter was 10 out of 10.  Try it, perhaps other menu items are better.
Great food and service! Mac and Cheese, Waffles, Fried Chicken, Short rib meatloaf! Chef came out to explain that the mash was not up to standard and offered a replacement. My son only likes mash so we waited for the new batch. It was worth the wait! They felt bad about the wait so the meatloaf was on the house. Wasn't necessary cause we chose to wait but nevertheless grateful.
This place has AMAZING potential, but service is subpar at best.  I've given this place 2 chances.  The first time, I couldn't PAY someone for a drink. I just ended up leaving. The second time, the waiter just brought me a beer instead of a beer menu. Then demanded I pay immediately.  Its bizarre service at best.
After reading a positive series of reviews, I ordered two dishes from them on Seamless - the Tom Ka soup and the Kao Kha Hmoo.  The order came promptly, and everything was nice and hot although the bag was soaked with oil and meat juice.  The Tom Ka Gai was tasty, although the chicken was a little bit tough and the portion on the small size (less than a pint).  Where I really ran into an issue was on the Kao Kha Hmoo.  While the Pork was slightly overcooked (read: dry), the taste was delicious especially with the sauce they provided until I found SMALL PIECES OF SHARP PLASTIC throughout the dish.  I was hungry enough to pick them out rather than call the restaurant for a reorder (which would have been too late by their schedule, anyhow), but I was pretty upset.  It's not everyday I get potentially dangerous material in my take-out.
I just paid $15 for a little bowl of soup that is literally a chicken thigh floating in broth with a few pieces of carrot and two tiny chicken empanadas that were full of BONES! My coworkers come here for the cheap lunch special and love it but gambling by deviating from that selection is NOT worth your time or moneyq.
I think this place is overrated.  The only thing I like about this place is about their decor. Look very unique. And our sever she is very friendly.  First we come in this spot on a Sunday night and it was not every busy and the host told us to wait around 20-30 mins. Which is fine. We finally get seated and started to order our food.  Apps:  1 Thai crepe dumpling ( minced chicken, peanuts, sweet turnips with sweet soy sauce) we like it . Because it fresh and very soft texture.  2 Chicken satay( the chicken is over grilled and finally we can't eat it)  3spring roll( very crispy, but too oily ) 4steam mussels ( standard, nothing special)   Entrees 1 pad Thai ( standard, but too smell)  2 pad see sew( good, but small plate and over pricy  3 basiel fired rice ( not bad)
"I walked into this place with really high hopes- and according to the other reviews, it sounds like maybe we just stopped by on the wrong day. When we walked in there was a warm welcome- we instantly felt comfortable. The staff here was really very sweet. I even remember saying ""I want this to be our regular place!"" It felt like home. We ordered a chopped chicken plate and a chopped chicken sandwich. This is where it became disappointing. They were out of several things on the menu (biscuits (WHY!?!?!??!), kale salad, a fruit plate (i think?), and something else..) and when I chose my sides I was told that the menu had changed and I would only be receiving 2 of the 3 I was allotted (according to the menu). All I know is I ended up with the potato salad, greens, and either pups or corn fritters.. the waitress mentioned something about salmon in the corn fritters and I didn't see any of that on my plate. I was confused.  At that point I stopped paying attention because the waitress told me they were never making biscuits again and I was trying to process why anyone would ever take biscuits off the menu. -__- The chicken was dry. So dry we didn't eat our meals. The waitress asked how things were and we said it was ""alright"". I know she didn't make it- not her problem. She knew we weren't thrilled but that was that. Maybe there is something going on that we don't know about, but it certainly seems like there was a lot of confusion and the kitchen was having some trouble. We left after having just a few bites of our $50 meal. Total bummer. The pups or corn fritters or whatever I ended up with were super good though."
Came here for brunch with a friend after yoga. Very nice decor. Has a live band on Sunday. I ordered a beef burger and my friend ordered a chicken sandwich. Both are good portion and taste very good. Would definitely recommend it for a decent brunch spot.
"Really 3.5 stars. After visiting this restaurant recently I now understand the mixed reviews.  There is a lot of hype surrounding this restaurant. While I did have a good experience here, it didn't blow me away like I had expected.  The service is truly great, I would go back for that alone. We started with the beet tartar, yes beet not beef (I was confused for a second when I saw it on the menu) and the arugula salad. I tried both and while both dishes were fine, nothing stood out to me. I did prefer the arugula salad. We had the gnocchi win oxtail and spaghetti with lobster. I enjoyed my spaghetti and felt it was cooked perfectly. I did not particularly care for the gnocchi dish and my husband thought it was fine but not great.  When I made the reservation I told them it was our anniversary and they brought out our dessert with ""Happy Anniversary"" written on the dish, which I thought was such a nice touch. But the dessert was just OK to me. I will return for the service and to try out other dishes because I need to understand what this hype is about."
If I lived near here, I'd probably come here every day. We ordered the pork soup dumplings, fried chicken noodle soup, vegetables over rice, and sweet and sour pork ribs. Not saying it's the best I've had of any of those, but everything we had was super delicious. A bit on the salty side, especially the soup for the noodles and the sweet and sour pork. But I loved every bite. They don't have too many things on the menu but they do have enough that I would want to come back and try pretty much everything. All the restaurants next door don't look anywhere near as good, while this place has a nice ambiance, is very clean inside, self-service so you don't really have to tip, and plays sad love songs the whole time you eat. Probably not a great place to date, because you'd be coming back here to eat dumplings and listen to those sad songs, crying, if you broke up. :) Loved it. The dumplings are better while they are so hot they burn your tongue, so don't let them sit too long!
Basta Pasta is not your typical Italian restaurant - it is an Asian-Italian fusion. My friend and I found out about this restaurant from pictures of their infamous cheese wheel and being a huge cheese lover, this was a place we had to try! We made reservations for a Saturday night a week beforehand, and got seated 10 minutes after we arrived. The restaurant is rather small and cramp, so you may need to get there early if you don't have a reservation. For the appetizer, we ordered the Gnocchi di Patata ($10) and it was one of the best gnocci we ever had! It had a delicious cream sauce and the pasta was perfectly chewy. Half of our table ordered the Sea Urchin Pasta - Linguine ai Ricci di Mare ($22) and it was amazing! The sea urchin was so fresh and the uni flavor really came through in the pasta! The dish had a delicious pink cream-based sauce with generous portions of uni - perfect balance of flavors! Definitely recommend the dish if you love uni! If you love cheese, the Parmesan cheese wheel pasta may be worth getting due to the hype and presentation (Spaghetti con Prosciutto e Parmigano $18). The spaghetti is served in a huge wheel of parmesan cheese and then topped with fresh basil and topped with a few slices of prosciutto.  Delicious dinner with great friends! My mouth waters just thinking of the uni pasta!
I was in DUMBO to pick up some chocolate for Valentine's Day. I decided to stop at Bo Concepts and stumbled upon AlMar Restaurant.  I enjoyed the ambiance, energy, and the space. I love when I am able to have 1/2 sandwich and either salad or soup for lunch. I ordered an asparagus salad and a panini consisting of bell peppers, goat cheese, and sundried tomatoes. I think the sandwich could have used some salt. The salad was good and the asparagus was thinly sliced and filling. I'll come here for brunch to see more of the menu. I like the options starting to appear in DUMBO.
Love coming here for a quick snack or something to fill me up. The recent upgrades in the restaurant made more seats available for customers to sit in and enjoy their food.  My go to item in the menu is their Fish taco!  Their fish isn't fried to the point where all you taste is the oil and the addition of the sauce and avocado in the taco helps give a perfect balance.
Nice joint, a little cramped if you get seated at the barstool around the outside of the restaurant. I had the Shoyu Ramen, and it was good. They added corn, which seems odd, and it's the first time I've seen it. They have 2 daily specials with 10 servings only, I'll try to get there early and update my review.
"""MARVELOUS"" is the word I would use to describe my dining experience at The Alcove. The thing that really sets this little gem of a restaurant apart from all others is not only the mouth watering food but the staff is stellar.  Coming to The Alcove is more like going to visit your best friend for dinner.  It's all about great ambience, fantastic food and that warm feeling that only someone who is familiar with you gives you. Jonathan and Hadrian really possess the magic touch needed to run a successful business.  They are friendly, engaging and accommodating.  The entire staff is really on point. We order the Cuban sandwich with meat so succulent and tender it makes your mouth water for more.  The chicken wings were crunchy and cooked perfectly and the truffle fries are a slice of heaven.  The food is amazingly well spiced.   It's nice to go to a place and not be rushed out after you take your last bite from your dish.  The Alcove should be the model for all restaurants who want the recipe of success."
Very good greek salad.  We ordered the large and it's too big for 2 people, Feeds four.  Lemon potatoes are delicious. The lemon potatoes order is a very large.   Order feeds four people.  We also ordered the grilled calamari.  Calamari was fresh and tender. All and all a good place to eat greek food.
This place blew my mind with their service, you don't have to ask for anything, the servers are always on top of everything! Best service ever and I mean that. The food was excellent as well, most notably the braised short ribs and duck/foie gras ravioli.  The braised short ribs was so tender, melt in your mouth with every bite. I could eat 2 or 3 orders of that. The duck and foie gras ravioli was the other highlight of the night, rich and creamy, hint of sweetness, yum! Now the famous spaghetti, I'm sad that I didn't like as much as my friends did. I love spaghetti, was super excited about it. Yes, it was perfectly cooked, the pasta and the sauce, it was good spaghetti, but didn't get the same satisfying feeling as the short ribs. I wanted to like the grilled octopus because I'm a huge octopus lover, but it was just alright, wasn't as tender as I would have liked.  I am definitely a big fan. Tip: the sign for the restaurant is tiny (yellowish color), can be easily missed. Restrooms are downstairs and the sink is shared betweent the men and women's restrooms. First for me!
After seeing all the videos on FB my husband made one request for our trip to NY. We must visit Peter Luger. Actually the topic to even go to NY was because he saw the video. We made reservations 2-3 months in advance. They had one spot left at 12:45pm Labor Day weekend. I'm sure from a lot of out of towners. We took it. When we got there, there was a line out the door. The bouncer informed us that they were walk ins. We walked in to our reservation and we overheard the host telling the person that walked in that the wait might be an hour. Yikes. We were seated and I noticed ALOT of open tables. Do they keep the tables open to appear busier? Some of the tables remained opened the whole time we were there.. Suspicious....  Nonetheless we ordered our food and waited anxiously.  We ordered two cocktails and they were stiff. STIFF! We were super tipsy by the time we left and a few hours afterwards. Love it.  The bread was great but it was super cold. Would have been better warm.  We finally got our Steak for 2, Luger's Special German Fried Potatoes (for 2), Creamed Spinach (for 2). Steak for 2 - We asked for medium rare and it came back well done some parts were even burnt ... wtheck. It wasnt even anything special. We had to keep adding salt and drenching it in the sauce.  German Fried Potatoes - Like hash potatoes. Burnt and lacking in flavor. See a pattern forming? Creamed Spinach - Was okay but how do you mess up creamed Spinach.  This restaurant only accepts cash so for everything we coughed up around $200.  Save yourself the trip.
"Quite possibly the *worst* service experience I've ever had in a looooong while. I went with two guests for breakfast. The ordering proceeded if a bit slowly. We do not eat pork and my sister specifically requested her sandwich be made without it. The sandwich arrives and both she and my sister take a bite only to find it does in fact have bacon. The real trouble started when I could not get the Server's attention and had to go to another staff person for help. When I explained to her the food had bacon and was ordered without, she gave me a defensive and offhand ""it happens"". I explained to her not eating pork is a thing some people do, she might have heard of Jews and Muslims and vegetarians and vegans etc. Her replacement sandwich never came and our server disappeared. We eventually told him not to bring it, so my sister had nothing to eat. Good job guys! Other issues: the French toast we ordered for dessert came with the mains, and the butternut squash soup was bland and sweet. But it was the truly appalling service that takes the cake. Not even an apology. Never again."
I was waiting to go to this place for a long time. All the pictures looked so good! What a disappointment! My shawarma plate was cold as snow! Ok, that's fine, I can eat cold food...but the salad....omg! The tomatoes looked horrible: like they spend hours there. Whatever. My friend liked her falafel...but definitely not going back there.
Nan Xiang has a small and simple menu, but are good at what they make. It's been been around for a long time and due to the overwhelming business, they've expanded to three rooms (they'll start closing down the third room when it is nearing closing time). The line can get pretty long during peak hours since it is a touristy spot, but it should move rather quickly. When you arrive, you'll be given a number (most people choose to wait outside). My favorites are: - pork soup dumplings - beef scallion pancake - fried dumplings - kao fu (from cold appetizers) - jellyfish (from cold appetizers) These two dishes are good as well, but I order it moderately because it can be a bit too oily for me: - fried ricecakes - seafood crispy noodle Prices are pretty affordable! There is a public parking lot across the street, but it gets extremely crowded. If you drive then you're better off parking at Skyview Mall a couple blocks away for $3  for 3 hours with incremental increases.
My colleagues and I travel to New York quite often, mainly in the area of Manhattan or Brooklyn. While we were up in Manhattan, we were advised to try our Carmine's for their authentic, family style Italian. We went during lunch time after making a reservation, so we didn't experience any long wait like the aforementioned reviews - so make sure to make a reservation prior to going, it does get quite busy! To start off, we got the Fried Calamari, which came out in huge portions for an appetizer, which of course we didn't complain. Our Chicken Parmagiana and Fettuccine with Clam Sauce was a little above average on the taste spectrum. The entrees as well, came in huge portions but the sauce was not as delicious as expected. Too much Clam Sauce especially, made the fettuccine soggy and quite blend in the end. Carmin'e family style food and decor illustrates a both traditional and modern vibe. I will give them a 4/5 for great food, wonderful ambiance, followed by a second-rate service.
Nothing special.  just ok My lobster roll had more lettuce then lobster.  For the price they charge I was expecting a little more
ive been here only twice. i had the pasta tasting menu the first time which is excellent. the traditional tasting menu is not as good as the pasta tasting.  amazing service and great ambience.  i would go back for their yummy pasta!
This small and not-so-fancy restaurant has some great noodles. I tried their noodle soup and also the pan fried noodle. Because the noodles are hand-pulled by the chef, they are amazingly chewy and tasty. I personally would recommend trying the pan fried noodles if you are not so familiar with distinct Chinese broth taste. If you are trying the noodle soup, then I recommend adding cilantro and sriracha sauce to it. Great food for great value. Also, they only accept cash.
Great place for lunch. We looked at yelp reviews and had assumed it was perfect outside seating based on the photos. We weren't disappointed since the decor was cute and the temp inside was cool. Can't complain about anything we ordered. Between 3 girls, we split curry buns, Thai wings, shrimp pad see ew and crispy duck pad Thai. Since it was a lunch special (before 4pm closure), our two entrees came with a side salad and appetizer option. Edamame and Dumplings were both very good choices. Without drinks, our bill came to exactly $50.
Stopped in for a late breakfast on a Saturday afternoon. The place was jammed, we had to wait about a hour for a table. After finally getting inside I realized why there was a wait they only have about twenty four seats, it's a cozy place. We were pretty excited to try this place while we were in town because we had seen it on tv and of course they received great reviews. The menu has great options from catfish, grits and their staple fried chicken and pie. Even as busy as they were the service was friendly and quick. We tried the fried catfish, grits, biscuit and gravy and a pecan crunch donut. The catfish was nice and crispy but it really lacked flavor. The grits were nice and creamy but bland and I liked the little bit of salsa the out on top. The biscuit was big and flaky but doughy in the middle and the gravy had nice chunks of sausage. The donut was really big and had great crunch but the flavor was off. Not really sure what happen there. We also orderd a side of their fried chicken wing, the chicken was bland, dry and inedible. We wanted to try their apple pie but after seeing it sitting out on the counter  behind the glass and looking really dry, deflated and sad we decided to pass. Pretty sad to wait all that time to be disappointed.
ordered wonton in chili oil n soy sauce, beef noodle soup. about $15. wonton in chili oil n soy sauce, as expected good with this price. the sauce is right to the point, not too salty, not oily, not over spicy. beef was delicious, rich sauce in depth. 1 star deducted from the noodle. overly cooked, not the right type of Shanghai's noodle. 1 star deducted from the worm that comes w my beef noodle soup. (look at the pictures) ** this visit was in Aug
When my husband and I arrived, we had to wait a good while for the host to acknowledge us and ask how many people were in our party. When we were finally seated, we saw that they didn't clean our area. I was very close to stepping in tomato sauce. I decided to go to the bar and get a drink. I told them my drink and saw that they had forgotten about me and my drink. I went back to my table and complained to my husband. Our waiter asked us what we wanted to eat and we told her. About thirty mins later she came with our food. I asked her what happened to our appetizer meal, she stated she forgot. Finally, when we received I'm our mean it was salty and overcooked. I would not recommend this restaurant.
Cherish the unique  food offered in this place.  Been here a few times for brunch, dinner or take out and I adore the portions served, reasonable prices and most importantly the very good flavor. However, waiting was always my concern here. Is there a way to shorten the time of cooking our food? Guess none. This isn't a fast food  (Its fun to answer your own question) . Service is pretty slow.  More  training and orientation for the staff is needed.
Decided to get lunch while I have jury duty. Place is very small but cozy. Came during lunch time obvs. Food is really good. Got the ribeye cheesesteak. Must come back here again
I LOVE this pizza bar. I try to go off-peak hours or order to pickup because lunch time gets super packed. The service is good, good is ready quickly, and reasonably priced for a whole sheet of delicious pizza. They're not sold by the slice and from what I was told they don't sell the round pies until after 5, which is smaller and thinner. Perfect every time. GO!
"Nice ambiance and staff, but service was slow, maybe because it was a ""busy"" night. They forgot our drinks and we ended up getting when we were about to pay the bill.  Some of our dishes were extremely salty, so salty that we stop eating. We just didn't say anything because the place was so busy and it would take a while to get the food replaced."
The Soup Dumplings might be one of the BEST things I have ever eaten. I had never heard of them before and I am now officially hooked. The rest of the food was good as well but those dumplings. Wish the service was better but the food made up for it.
I want to start out by saying that I was very excited to try this place and had high hopes because there is a severe lack of authentic Chinese food in this area. First of all, they are no longer BYOB!!  However, they do not have a liquor license so no alcohol here. Don't understand why they took the BYOB away :(  Service: The service could definitely be improved. We had to wave a server down for everything we needed and saw multiple other tables do the same thing. They definitely need to hire extra people. Aside from a few waiters working attentively, everyone else was socializing. The hostess had her friend here the whole time we were there and they were gossiping and on their phones. Extremely unprofessional! -1 star  Cleanliness: The girl with the nose ring was playing with her nose ring the whole time and was also serving food. Ew. When she brought out our lamb dish I cringed. -2 stars  Food: The food is pretty damn good. That's what the 2 stars are for. We got the string beans, baby squid, and spicy lamb. All three dishes were very good and had a lot of flavor. Not too spicy.  The back of the house seems to be working a lot better than the front. Please, hire more people and train the ones you have. Some of these issues might be because of the no tipping policy. As much as I love this whole no tipping thing, it might be why the service is so lacking.
Not impressed by the selection of food offerings.  Also it is in a crappy location, all the way west.  Only reason I visited was because I happened to be attending an event at the Javitz center.   The layout feels cramped, food lines were overflowing into the seating areas, there was garbage all over the place, and there was not much natural sunlight.  Dining there was not a comfortable experience.   I like the concept of a large upscale food hall, but with the combination of offerings, location and ambiance, I would much rather visit a superior food hall like Hudson Eats.
Grimaldi's vs. Julianna's ? Definitely Julianna's. This pizza joint is making some amazing authentic pizza. Located right near the Brooklyn bridge and next door to grimaldis, Julianna's is a delicious addition to the neighborhood and it trumps the old iconic pizza spots like grimaldis.  Quality here is key. Super fresh ingredients. We ordered the no.1 (a white pizza with smoked mozzarella and bacon) and a margarita pie with pepperoni. My mouth is drooling speaking about this. The no. 1 was so good. The mozzerella was fresh and you can taste the smokiness. The drizzle of truffle oil took it over the top. My only complaint was the bacon may have been too salty and a bit too much. The margarita pie was the best I've had. Super thin crust with fresh tomatoe basil and cheese! Soooo good!  If you come to Brooklyn you must come try the pizza here. You will not be disappointed. The staff here is super friendly the pizza is made to perfection. Be sure to get here before 4 if you come for lunch because they close the oven before they reopen for dinner !
Terrible customer service, even if you pay me to eat I will not go. Food taste worse than your high school lunch, it is a disgrace with poor hygiene. Please do not waste the food anymore.
Sort of disappointed. Expected better service. I called to reserve a table for a birthday dinner 2 weeks ahead (because they were impossible to get in touch with via email) and, after confirming 2 times via phone and 2 times via email, the day BEFORE my reservation they text me with wrong time/people. I call them to check on my reservation and the girl on the phone said that somebody made a mistake and they already gave away the table that I asked for, great! So they moved us to a different time slot, okay. I get there 15min later than the reservation time (good luck finding parking) and they had already given our table away, awesome. We had to wait for 30 more minutes. Somebody brought me balloons and several employees explained that it is not allowed (my guest had no clue) because they have real candles on the walls. Anyways, we ordered our food and bottles of wine. The waiter was sweet and friendly BUT our food did not arrive for over 45min. I asked and the waiter said they messed up our order in the kitchen, so sorry, etc. They got a pizza order wrong as well - it was supposed to be vegan and it ended up not being vegan. That's a pretty serious mistake right there. I had the Carroll place burger with truffle fries everybody talks about online - the patty and speck were delish but the thing was SO dry, it was hard to finish. The truffle fries only had truffle flavor on the top layer and after that they were regular fries. The arancini are nothing impressive. I love their wings, really good. The pizza was okay (I am 100% Italian from Italy so I know my pizza). They just messed up SO MANY TIMES in one evening that although they sent us free shots and a bottle of sparkling (thanks to the manager).It was just an okay spot, I would love to be able to recommend this place to people but I just can't after everything that was messed up in just 2 hours.
Food was awful. Soppressata pizza was too salty and lamb fusilli had very little meat. Our server was competent and friendly. Coat check person put my wet umbrella in my coat pocket. We won't be back
"The Short: For being a Michelin starred restaurant, it did not live up to the hype. I would actually give it 3.5 stars though.  Service was a little slow and inattentive, dishes are $15-$25. Decent dishes, but not the amazing, ""Michelin-star"" quality (I do have a bias being from San Diego). Red Sangria was good. Good salsas and guacamole. The Long: I came here with my parents looking to figure out what Michelin starred mexican food is.  My wife and I are from San Diego, so mexican food to us means street tacos and local hole in the wall places. There is usually a decent wait, so I would make a reservation before going. It took us a while to get our order taken after sitting down, which I was surprised at since usually the Michelin guide takes into account quality of service.  We ordered the guacamole and chips which were good and they have good salsas of varying spicy levels.  The enchiladas with mole were decent, with fair chocolate flavors, but nothing amazing.  The carne asada was cooked well, but the flavor was standard and definitely not as flavorful as the carne asada I'm used to in California.  The lamb was cooked very well, falling off the bone with a nice spice, subtle chile flavors, and probably the best dish.  Overall, the food is decent (especially for east coast mexican food), but I don't think it lives up to the Michelin star hype. To me part of the mexican food experience is a hole-in-the-wall place with food cooked in lard with tons of flavor. To me, making it into more ""gourmet"" food to me doesn't do justice to the food or experience."
I wish I had done more research and realized that the dim sum (and all other plates for that matter) cannot be ordered in small portions here. So, we had the crab and pork soup dumplings because that seemed to be the must-have there. We would not have known how to eat them had we not been seated at an 8 top with a party of 6 Japanese tourists who seemed to know how to enjoy these pockets of fun. You use the soup spoon to take them out of the large bamboo steamer, pour the black vinegary sauce sitting on the table over them, then use your chopsticks to puncture them and let the rich broth drip onto your spoon. YUM! We also had some noodles that our waiter 9not the nicest guy on the planet) claimed to be the special (first ones on the menu) and they were good, not mindblowing. A couple of Shing Tao beers and that was enough food for the both of us. If you don't require super friendly service or refuse to sit with other people and not in the mood to sample lots of smaller plates and have CASH, then you might like this place. Next time we're in Chinatown, we'll look for cart service which I saw is actually a filter in Yelp!
I have been to hometown once before and I'm happy I finally gave it a try. I had the mac and cheese, cornbread and brisket. The brisket was very good and so was the mac and cheese. It was super cheesy just like I like it. The cornbread however could have been a bit better. It was too dry and a bit too hard for me. Not sure if I just had a bad batch. I wish they offered more sandwich options that were not spicy for people who don't like spice like myself The atmosphere is very gowanus and down to earth which is nice and I like the idea of ordering and seating yourself it's a nice experience. I give it four stars because I with the seating was arranged differently. I think it's a bit awkward that as your sitting down to eat everyone who is waiting online to order is staring at you. Makes it a bit uncomfortable but I'm sure many people don't mind that Other than the seating arrangement I think I'll come back
Disappointed by my dinner here. The tacos are tiny. And the worst part was how little protein was actually on them. For $3.75-4 PER TACO this wasn't cool. I was shocked when my order arrived of one fried chicken taco and one BBQ short rib taco. I had to search for any chicken because it looked like they had given me the wrong order. Eventually I did find two minuscule pieces of cold fried chicken on the one. The tacos were both drenched in sauce which made them soggy and quick to fall apart. Overall, not into it at all - even though the flavor was okay.
My friends ranked this place as their favorite one star michelin restaurant, so I had high hopes for it.  I opted for the seasonal tasting menu for $125 since it had the most courses and they all looked delicious. The meal started off with clam & scallop salad. The clams and scallops were very very fresh and tasted great.  The warm lobster salad was also quite good. Lots of flavor and lobster not too tough or chewy. Artic Char was definitely the highlight of the meal for me. I've never had a salmon so soft and taste so good before. There wasn't much of a distinct salmon taste, which made it tastes even better. Mushroom tortellini was a huge miss for me. I didn't like the mushroom cheese flavor on the inside cause it tasted too heavy.  Roasted duck breast and sausage tasted good. I had the duck breast and the sausage individually and they were great. I mixed the two into one bite and it still tasted great albeit a bit different.  Strawberries & cream dessert was a very unique dish that I've never had before. The green ice had a vegetable taste that I couldn't quite put my finger on.   The light to heavy food transition was great and was really well thought out. Service here is top notch and they also happily accommodated our vegan friend.
Ambiance, service, wine and pizza offerings are great. There are no pasta dishes so don't expect to see the typical Italian menu. Some of those in my group had the lasagna and said it was good but not something they'd order again. I, on the other hand, had a calzone which was fantastic. I will return just for the ambiance and service alone.
So this place features in Michelin guide and though the food was good but I would not call it the best Chinese food I have had in the states. Having said that the food was still good and maybe lets say one of the best xio long bao that I have ever had (and I have had the din tai fung in California).  We got pork xio long bao,  wontons in spicy peanut sauce,scallion pancake, chive hot pocket and crispy noodles with shredded chicken. The xio long bao was full of soup and was really good, scallion pancakes were just ok not the best we have had, the chive hot pocket was good and stuffed with a lots of chives but the shredded chicken noodle dish was just meh. The dish of the day was 100 percent the wontons in spicy peanut sauce. The peanut sauce was so good that I wanted to drink it, I poured the remainder of the sauce all over the noodles so that they might get a little flavor.  They say that don't expect good service from a Chinese restaurant and this place was a good example of why Chinese restaurants have that reputation. We had no sauces on our table and we didn't get any with xio long bao. The nice couple on the next table noticed and passed us their bottle of sauce since they were done. When they left the restaurant we had borrow the chili oil and other sauces from that table. Also the table was small and there was not enough space yet they didn't bother to remove the empty dishes after we were done with a dish.  But other than that food was decent, next time I would like to try some of the breakfast dishes.
My friend and I had a late dinner here on Sunday night and there was a healthy crowd in the restaurant. Go later to avoid waiting.  Enjoyed the waviness of the noodles and texture more than Ippudo. Thought the broths were fantastic and didn't leave we thirsty later due to the added MSG.
Horrible Food has great presentation. But HORRIBLE taste Service was poor... waitress was rude Music is loud.  Please don't waste your time
We ordered butter chicken, pepper chicken and drums of heaven for delivery. The meat did not taste good and the quality of food was bad which was unlike earlier food we had with Nanking in New Jersey. We are definitely not impressed with this Nanking in NY.
Disclaimer: we are vegetarian The good reviews this place has had intrigued us and we had always wanted to eat here. However the forbidding wait times  (40+ minutes) always deterred us. Today we decided to stick through a 45 min wait. While I still believe that patience and persistence pays off, I think there are exceptions. There are exactly three vegetarian options on the menu. One of them is a starter. So we got all three of them. Vegetable dumpling, some tofu and vegetable ensemble, and a noodle dish. The vegetable dumpling was pretty nice. That merits one of the two stars I've given. The next star is for the waitress.  Next the main entrees. We absolutely hated the noodles and the vegetable tofu dish we got. The sauce was trite - it didn't seem there was anything there other than soy sauce. Also, the noodles was extremely bland. The description said it had curry powder. We looked hard but couldn't find any. Terribly disappointing. Here are a few steps you can follow to replicate those dishes at home 1) cut vegetables 2) saute in some oil. 3) Throw in an inordinate amount of soy sauce. 4) serve. The place is not cute or anything per se, very crowded, have-to-keep-elbows-tucked-in-to-avoid-getting-your-neighbours-nose kind of place (maybe it was not too bad, but my taste buds are too mad at me right now). Sometimes good decor assuages a bad experience, this wasn't one such case. They really must have tremendous non vegetarian food to have such awesome ratings and reviews.
What happened?  The food has gone downhill.  That was not carbonara tonight.   So bummed.  Overpriced and not the least bit worth it.
Okay food, pretty terrible service. My friends and I came here for my boyfriend's birthday after a class at Brooklyn Zoo. Despite reading the mixed bag of reviews, I was optimistic that the great looking food would make up for the potentially bad service. Also I wanted something close to the gym. I knew I was taking a risk. We got there and the atmosphere was great, the backyard was great, people seemed to be having a good time. We went inside and right away I noticed a huge pile up of people waiting for the bartender's attention. Then I get to the front of the line and was immediately told they were out of certain drinks. Luckily I didn't intend to order those drinks, but some of my friends were already bummed out.  Then I tried to order food. Two menu options were already out of question. This was about 7:30pm on Saturday night. I ordered my 3rd choice, and sat down and waited. Pretty quickly, my friend who had ordered last...got his meal first. And it was exactly what I had ordered. Ok. Not a huge deal, but when you're trying to make the birthday boy happy, it kind of sucks. I eventually got my food and certain items were warm, and others were basically cold. The food was ok, but none of us were blown away. Another friend never got his food. Maybe 20min after I ordered, a friend came back with the sandwich they had told me they were out of.  A friend arrived much later, maybe 9pm, and by then they were out of almost everything. They blamed a catering event of 200 people earlier that day for why they didn't have any food. Don't restaurants prepare for this? Shouldn't that be something they either account for or close the restaurant? I mean it was Saturday night in Brooklyn... Also toward the end of the night the bartender was drinking behind the bar, which at that point I didn't even care anymore because it actually made him nicer. I wish I hadn't gambled on this place, especially for my boyfriend's birthday...learned my lesson!
Same menu from the 80's but not the same taste. Not as good as I remember.... Way too salty.. At least the hot and sour soup was good. 3.5 stars
Came here with a group of friends. It's upscale Korean with nice decor. Service was good. We had an assortment of dishes; I don't think anyone loved their meal. The dumplings were okay. I had dolsot bibim bap with tuna sashimi. Tuna sashimi does not work for this dish because it ends up cooking the rare tuna and making it overly tough. It could have used more vegetables and the option of putting a fried egg on top. They did give everyone their own banchan--three little salad/kimichi. Would have been nice with a little more. Overall this restaurant was just okay but probably won't go again considering it's pricey for Korean food (give the Tribeca address and nicer decor) and the food was only so-s0. I've learned Koreatown or the Outer Boroughs is the way to go in the future.
Came for brunch with a group of friends. We waited a while because not all of our party arrived yet and there was a long line. The hostess wasn't pleasant at all which explains why I only gave 4 stars. But our waitress and the experience after we were seated was phenomenal. The waitress kept checking if we had everything we needed and was friendly and attentive throughout our stay. Food was piping hot when we got them and we didn't have to wait too long for our food. I ordered the Oyster Rockefeller as my main dish and also ordered the Mac and cheese with corn and bacon. Both were AMAZING. these must be a staple to the brunch menu!  Mimosa was made to perfection. Will return soon!
Ordered the Goma Shoyu Tuna and sadly it wasn't as good as the reviews here said it would be! Not only is chikarashi on the expensive end of the poke spectrum, the portions are on the smaller end. Flavoring was decent, but the amount of fish was extremely meager. For the same amount of money I can get a larger pokebowl somewhere else.
Tried to come here for the happy hour but my guests were late. Good thing is that they take names down so they knew roughly how long I've been waiting to be seated. This place gets packed pretty quickly so be sure your whole party is there - on time to be seated.  I was with a group of four so we tried to order all across the menu to get more out of this rare visit. Starters and sides: tetsunabe kurobuta sausage. Peking Duck bun, Kakuni bao (pork belly bun),  and Zuke Maguro.  The fav was the Peking Duck.  Worth re-ordering was the Zuke Maguro.  The sausage was good but nothing uniquely different from other places. For entrees, the Tokyo Chicken ramen was excellent.  The cuts of chicken were super fresh and tender.  Very tasty on it's own and when eaten w/ the broth.  This was very different from the usual ramen broths served.  The other standout ramen was the Tsukemen, the colors and the presentation of ingredients made this bowl very fun to scarf down.  Hubby liked a lot.  For myself, instead of ramen, I ordered the Tare Meshi and combined it w/ the sausage (from the apps) and made my own meal.  The onsen tamago was delicious...it's just an egg but it was so perfectly prepared.  Hit the spot.  I ordered this side on purpose to try the chashu sauce...liked it a lot.  Great for a side dish to anything on the menu.   The drink menu is a must try...when in Rome...try it all.  (Note:  there's happy hour at the bar counter which you can order on the side while waiting to be seated).  I would love to come back and try more of Chef Morimoto's menu.  Fun after work spot for a satisfying bite.
Pretty much in line with my expectations.  Solid, straightforward family-style portions, but don't expect fancy flourishes.  Ordered braciole during Sunday dinner, and I'll simply say I prefer it to be individual rolls vs. their large single roll.  Chicken parm was solid.  Service is prompt and generally friendly.  Bar upstairs is a nice sanctuary to watch some sports and have a drink while awaiting your table.
My go-to restaurant when I visit New York! Last year, I came here for the first time when I had a 4 hour stopover in Manhattan. My stepsister recommended the ratchaburi with their pork baos and fried tofu. I didn't have time to sit down and eat so I took it to go and ate it two hours later. It was so delicious!! I couldn't help myself but want to go back again.  When I came back to NYC this summer, I made sure to come back here first. I came on a Thursday night around 630PM and there was a huge lineup. Luckily I came alone so I got seated right away. The waitresses were super friendly and I got the ratchaburi again. It was just as delicious as last time. I also ordered the barbecue ribs, which were surprisingly sweet and well cooked (considering the restaurant is Thai), and the papaya salad, which had an interesting sour taste to it.  Next time when I come back to NYC, I'll definitely come back here again!! Thank you!
I was looking for a good place to eat in East Village and saw that this place has a lot of reviews  so I wanted to try it. I took my family here. I got seated pretty quickly because I came during brunch time. The waitor was nice but it was so loud I could barely hear him. There wasn't a lot to pick from on the menu and I am a person who likes a variety of things so this place did not meet up to it. I got 3 dishes, the steak and eggs, the curry koai soi or something like that and the sizzling sigsig. The best of the three was the curry but the other two was a disappointment, like i had to force myself to swallow it. It was something I could make better at home. So overall I would not go to this place again.
I have never had a bad meal here, and I go often! In/Out vibe, no frills. Wine is low quality but delish! Fast Service. Sometimes a wait, but worth it!
"Recently stopped by here w some friends. This place is lit up!!! Meaning VERY bright. Most of us were not used to a bar being so bright and some complained that the lighting (glowy, orangey feel) made them feel sleepy. Some said the songs were not ""poppin."" The rest just stood around watching the sports game. But i will say the spot is clean, appears to be spacious, on a Saturday night--not overcrowded."
"If you considering...please don't -_- My two stars go to servers and interior...no stars for food, reservation system or management.. Upsetting but they could've been so much better but they really just trying to get whatever they can get... We made a reservation for 7:30 we happened to arrive at 7:15 we go to bar area kind of pushed to start drinks...ok... 8 pm we checking in with hostess how long the wait is going to be as the bar getting extremely packed that it feels like we are in a small night club bar nowhere to step ,we start checking open table which still has openings for 8 or 8:15 ...ridiculous...hostesses are used there to ""chill"" customers frustrations apologizing and stuff although reservations still available....8:20 we get seated...  FOOD  Doesn't taste bad but all can be easily recreated in my kitchen not worth the price or the WAIT. Mediocre small portions. SERVICE  Nice and attentive ."
"I'm not even sure where or how to begin singing the praises of Traif. The restaurant, whose name translates to ""unkosher"" in Yiddish , has long been a staple in the Brooklyn dining scene. The cuisine it serves can't be described by the traditional genres; even Zagat is only able to place in the ""Eclectic"" and ""Small Plates"" categories. Regardless, one thing is for certain: The food served here is delicious. I'd been able to call in a few days beforehand to snag an 8PM dinner reservation; it goes without saying that these are pretty much necessary to guarantee a seating. On the planned day, we took a stroll on the Williamsburg Bridge and arrived at the inconspicuous entrance of Traif. The interior is fairly simple and cozy; tables are lined in two rows opposite the bar area, each set with a small candle for ambiance. As we were a little early for our reservation, we started with drinks at the bar. The bartender was extremely friendly, despite having to juggle multiple roles at once. As I was sipping the glass of Cava Rose I had ordered, he skimmed through the menu for us, explaining how all the dishes were very seasonal and even changed on a daily basis. With some of his recommendations, we decided on our plates for the night. One: Glazed Confit Chicken Wings. The wings were covered in an ingenious savory-spicy sauce composed of hoisin, five spice, and sriracha, covering a wide spectrum of tastes. The chicken skin was crisp and not overly fried, the interior white meat still tender. The plate was served right out of the kitchen, so the chicken was still extremely hot; eat with care. Two: Hampshire Pork Belly, Hearts of Palm, Bacon, Artichoke, and Clementine. Once I saw pork belly on the menu, there was no doubt that I was going to order it. The pork belly was perfectly seared, the interior delightfully fatty and tender. It was complemented with small bacon bits, hearts of palm, and artichoke leaves, while the hint of clementine added a hint of sweetness. There are times I find myself craving this dish because it was -that- good. Three: White Asparagus with Burrata Cheese, Roasted Hazelnuts, and Black Truffles. It was the first time I had tried white asparagus and compared to its green counterpart, was much milder in flavor. The burrata cheese was creamy, hinting on sweet, and the additional texture from the hazelnuts and the hint of the black truffle flavor made for a surprisingly rich dish. Four: Salt and Pepper Shrimp with Cauliflower. While I was a little hesitant to try this dish, I eventually was grateful that my palate had expanded to include seafood. The seasoning on the shrimp wasn't too zealous, allowing us to get the actual taste of the shrimp in each bite. The cauliflower was lightly charred, giving a smoky edge to an otherwise bland vegetable. A spicy, sriracha-based sauce was a smart addition to this plate. Five: Barbecue Short Rib Sliders. The short rib was so tender that it was clear it had been braised for hours. I wish that the sauce that had been used was a little less sweet and a little more spicy, it was was nonetheless delicious and the ratio of filling to bread was just right. The sweet potato fries were just as satisfying; they were served warm, neatly seasoned, and paired well with the smoked paprika aioli they were served with. We couldn't go home without trying the famed Bacon Donuts, of course. We were presented with four small glazed doughnut holes, sprinkled with bacon bits, and finished off with a scoop of coffee ice cream. While I wasn't blown away by this concoction, I certainly see (and tasted) its appeal. It's a smart combination of sweet doughyness against the salty, savory bacon bites and definitely worth an order, especially on your first visit. I have no qualms declaring that Traif delivers the full dining experience: a warm and comfortable dining environment, knowledgeable and professional staff, and an eclectic, creative menu that brings out a variety of ingredients, tastes, and cooking styles. Dishes are very reasonably priced as well, which means that it's perfectly all right to put Traif on your regular restaurant rotation... which, trust me, I already have."
The ramen's good but maybe not worth the hype. Try it out if the line isn't too long and you've never tried chicken based ramen before. But you're also not missing out on much if you don't. Totto's different in that they use chicken broth instead of the far more common pork broth. The chicken broth is not as greasy or heavy as the pork, but it also lacks depth in taste. I got the spicy paitan and tried the soup before mixing the spicy sauce in, and felt that it's a little bland. The spicy sauce definitely added more flavor. The noodles were cooked just right to my taste with an al dente texture--if you like your noodles softer, you should let your server know. The char siu pork was a little disappointing though, and not as soft and thick as I'd expected. The portion's decent, and I felt full from a bowl without having added any extra toppings.  The space is tiny, but it's great that you're able to see all the cooking being done in the open kitchen. It's not an ideal space for a group since there are only three tables for a four. You'll be seated much faster if you come in smaller groups and opt to sit at the bar.  I must say that I was impressed with their friendly service despite how busy they were. There was a wait when I came around 2 on a Thursday afternoon, and even a longer wait when I left around 3. I imagine the wait's much longer for dinner and on weekends. The line does move fast though since the ramens are made and served extremely quickly. I'm glad that I finally crossed Totto Ramen off of my dining list but I'm not sure if I'd be coming back.
"Wow....I give it 1 star for the Thai iced tea.  We went there for an early dinner around 5pm.  First of all, when we sat down, it was at a table that was all sticky, like it was not properly wiped down. This is supposed to be a Thai restaurant so I am not sure why there was a Japanese section on the menu.   I could not figure out the bizarre bathrooms.  Additionally, I didn't like that you have to come outside to wash your hands.    I ordered a fried chicken filet and shrimp tempura dish.  It was so heavily covered in peanut sauce all I tasted was peanuts.  Additionally, the chicken had a weird aftertaste (which the peanut sauce could not cover).  I did not enjoy my meal at all unfortunately.   Coming from Queens where there are Asian restaurants galore, this ""fusion"" pseudo Thai restaurant in Brooklyn just didn't cut it."
We went here for pre-theater dinner for the first time. I heard a lot about this place so I wanted to give it a try. We had the trecolori salad and special crab cakes for appetizer. The salad was just ok and was not properly seasoned. The crab cakes were not a lot of crab and too much breading. Next is the linguine with clams and puttanesca. Both were just ok. Pasta was over cooked. Overall the it was just ok. Nothing to rave about. Will definitely not comeback.
Wife and I ordered in from Bigoi the other night. Great pasta, generous portions for the money. We ordered the Bolognese,  piselli and prosciutto, and the Puttanesca. Each were very tasty with perfectly cooked pasta.  My ONE and ONLY Complaint, and i even considered knocking my review down to three stars because of this, is the fact that the pasta do NOT come with bread.  Very disappointing. Luckily we went food shopping earlier that day, and had a nice crusty baguette to mop the sauce up with!  Seriously, Pasta without the mopping bread, BLASPHEMY!  All in all, we'll be ordering here again. Just do yourself a favor, and prepare yourselves with your own bread.
"The stellar yelp ratings fall short. Food is forgettable.  The first thing you see before entering is a B rating and boy has this place not tried to improve. Serious dust buildup on vents but I still held hope. Opted for water after seeing the dirty, caked-on residue on the jars that hold bar ingredients and garnishes.  Service is mediocre. No personality and this is more reflective in the lack of ambiance. The decor attempts to compensate but the choice in music just was a complete turnoff.  About 3-4 tracks of Kodak Black came on and I was embarrassed and offended. An ""Asian Fusion"" restaurant blasting rap music - uncensored - that mentions ethnic slurs every 30 seconds while I eat noodles in a hoity toity crowd angered me and made this a regretful choice. Cherry on top was the bathroom. Tongs - yes tongs - underneath the sink. Everyone including management is absentminded and makes you wonder where is the respect to the patrons - to the food is - anymore. Picture speaks a thousand words and I'll leave you with the ""poster child"" of what this place really is."
"Wanted to like this place because it is literally across from my apartment and I love ramen. Unfortunately this place was not impressive at all. Usually when you walk into a Japanese restaurant or even Chinese restaurant you will see a mixture of Asian ethnicities which usually hints that the place will be pretty authentic. At this particular spot, that was not the case. This spot was filled with white American customers which often makes me feel some type of way when this happens at any ""Asian"" restaurant. I start wondering if the people inside even know what actual authentic food taste like. That being said... I took a look at the menu and saw fries as an appetizer. Thought that was weird but was curious to why a Japanese ramen spot would choose to have fries on their menu. I ordered them and was pretty grossed out. They were deli fries. Thick soggy with mayo and some type of tangy sauce dripped on top.  Next... I ordered the Vegetarian Ramen which had zero protein in it. No tofu just broth, noodles and vegetables but was the same price as a bowl of ramen with chicken or beef. How does that even make sense? Something gross about my ramen too was how it had kimchi in it. The flavor of the kimchi over powered my bowl of ramen. I was just not impressed at all. Zurutto needs to go to Totto Ramen in Hells Kitchen and get some serious pointers on how to make actual quality ramen. There's a reason Totto Ramen is filled with a mixture of Asian ethnicity customers. It's authentic. Zurutto is the type of ramen place a person goes to that has no idea what quality ramen is. A place that is more westernized and not so much Japanese Authentic.  Zurutto you're across from where I live and I plan on never going back. I'd much rather travel to Totto Ramen for some actual quality ramen."
Answer your phone. Placed multiple orders with you guys via Caviar. Terrible company where you can't have one person answer the phone. This is not a problem with Caviar, it's a problem with you! When I specify a simple request and you ignore it, that's terrible customer service. Food is inedible for me. Thanks for wasting $80. Also your $10 grandmas guacamole is a joke. Been an hour since my boyfriend ate both his $14 shrimp tacos: and he had the runs. Also chips were stale. Boooo!
Came here for dinner with a large group of friends the other night, thought it was just ok. The owner is extremely friendly and the service was great but I'm not sure the food is worth the price.  They're known for their frozen margaritas which were pretty good though pretty expensive (a flavored frozen will run you $18 minimum). The food was also pretty expensive and although portion sizes were large, flavor missed the mark a little for me. Not sure I could justify spending as much as I did again.
I will say this place reminds me of the touristy spots in Thailand, pictures of all the items on the menu. I've been here a few times, and I will say the fish entrees are the best things on this menu.  This time around I opted for crispy noodles, curry puffs, Tom yum soup. The noodles were how I expected, not in your face with flavor but not bland where I would drop fish sauce and whatever condiments that will make it salty. The curry puffs were on the sweet side for me, which is something I noticed when I was over there (things are sweeter in the motherland). Tom yum is Tom yum. What is my take away this time around? Get fish!
Great drinks, good food, seriously those eggplant chips.  Yes.  Like the atmosphere a lot.  Recommended!
Disappointing. Went for my birthday on Friday December 9th 2016 after reading the chef's book and reading great reviews. If you do not fill up on bread you will  leave hungry. After spending $500+ for two people  with wine and choosing to eat from the Le Bernardin  Tasting menu, I was expecting the wow factor. Maybe the chef's tasting menu is where you get the wow factor. The crusted red snapper  in green curry was awful. The staff worked like Robots. The food was ok not worthy of the price point. If you have never eating at Statholdergaarden or statholderens in Oslo or have never  had a fabulous unforgettable meal then you will enjoy Le Bernardin.
Didn't realize that they did not take same day reservations. We got there at 5:30 and still had to wait 20 + minutes for a table. Several large parties. It appears to be a favorite for birthdays. Service was polite but slow. Atmosphere is nice but very noisy. Hard to hear across the table. The food was bland and would have been better had they used a little seasoning. Reasonably priced but not sure we'll go back or bring friends there. On the whole, disappointing.
"Lovely atmosphere. Brutal food poisoning... Like all culinary tragedies, it's best to start at the beginning and then move toward gastronomic bedlam.  The atmosphere and positive yelp reviews drew us in. The food itself was average (the grand feast we had felt like a stylized salad), and overpriced ($48 for a ""grand feast"", why it's called ""grand"" is beyond me and compared to other Ethiopian places in Boston and LA this is expensive). After moving to a nearby bar, members of our party started getting hit with cramps and then the vomiting started, streams of it caking the Bushwick sidewalk. Diarrhea followed. The owner of the bar gave us napkins, water, and whatever else he had that could alleviate the symptoms. Our thanks to the kind people there.  Without the food poisoning this place was below average food-wise  and above average atmosphere-wise, but is that worth food poisoning."
With a Michelin star, the hefty tasting menu price tag, and all of the acclaimed reviews, I expected a whole lot more from Gramercy Tavern. I chose Gramercy Tavern to celebrate my birthday and decided to go for lunch since it was significantly cheaper at $65 per person for 5 courses. The menu consisted of marinated scallops (raw sashimi style), halibut, pasta shells with beans & mushrooms, duck breast & sausage, and peach rice pudding (they also had a chocolate cake served with stracciatella gelato that our waiter informed us about - it wasn't listed on the tasting menu). None of the dishes had the wow factor to my boyfriend and I..if I were to list our favorites dishes in order, it would have been the chocolate cake, the pasta, the duck breast & sausage, the scallops, the halibut, and lastly the rice pudding. We also had a complimentary coconut cake for my birthday, which was good as well.  I'm not one to put dessert as the best dish, so I'm sad to say that this was the case. The cake was super chocolatey, perfect to satisfy your sweet tooth, especially if you're a huge chocolate fan. Rich, dense, and most, while being complimented well by the stracciatella gelato. I just wish there was more gelato. It seemed like small portions were a pattern as the pasta was really small and left us wondering where the noodles were - the plating was inconsistent as my boyfriend basically had only beans. I know tasting menus are small portions, but Gramercy Tavern's portions seemed smaller, leaving us hungry and wanting more. Good thing we asked for more bread and had so much dessert that it filled us up. The duck breast was a perfect medium rare with a crisp fatty skin coating it; we both weren't a fan of the green sauce that was under the sausage - it left a very weird aftertaste. The halibut was forgetful - the white foamy sauce covered the entire fish, but added no value as the fish was bland; the fish was cooked well though. And finally, the rice pudding. If you're a fan of rice pudding, you might have a different opinion on this dessert - this was our first time having rice pudding and we deemed ourselves not to be fans. The bread however was a great addition to the meal - each piece was fresh out of the oven and came out piping hot. Soft little pillows of joy I must say! Kudos to the hostess and kitchen manager who allowed me to sit at my table and wait for my boyfriend as he was severely stuck in traffic. The other staff however, didn't seem like they wanted to be there. That being said, it wasn't a bad meal. However, at that price, I'd rather spend my money elsewhere.
Unfortunately, I have to report that I'm not sold by the concept of fast Italian that The Sosta is trying to sell. $12 for a paper container of pretty subpar pasta is not the best use of your money. I really love how much effort the restaurant has put into their branding and aesthetic, but ultimately the trendy millennial pink and marble table thing is better suited for cafes than for selling basic pastas.
Came here for lunch on a weekday, very crowded, but luckily, we had a reservation. Overall, it was an average experience; perhaps their brunch is better. I tried the huevos rancheros, but honestly, the complimentary bread and butter stole the show. Okay, that part of the meal was *amazing*. The bread had a nice thick crust and soft center, and the butter was creamy and so fresh - must have been homemade.  Huevos rancheros had fine flavor but nothing to write home about. Instead of being served with tortillas, the dish is garnished with crispy tortilla strips. Portion size was huge - definitely enough to split and still feel full.  Service was very impressive but prices are high! Didn't meet the hype for me.
This place was talked up a lot on the way there. What I got was mediocre. The food is cheap, which is great, but I would rather pay more money for something with better flavor. The dumpling wrap was very doughy and not much flavor. So slimy that it was hard to pick up.  I also had the bok choy, which was lacking in any kind of seasoning. I will not go again since I have had better dumplings in the city for a reasonable price
They forgot my order and lied about it. This place is clearly overrated and the staff needs some awakening.  I went in there for lunch with my colleague. We both ordered a simple don, but my colleague got his on time. I waited about 35 minutes. My colleague was done long before I got mine. In fact, guys who came in later than us got their don, and FINISHED IT ALL while I sat there waiting. Eventually, customers around me got replaced by other customers and I was still just sitting there. I finally asked the waitress, she looked absolutely confused. Then she tried to cover it up by saying my order was just backed up because there were too many orders. Too many orders? Too many so that people who got in after me got their food and finished their food? Too many to a point that my colleague was all done with food even though we ordered the dons at the same time?  Only after some complaining did the food come out. It came out like 5 minutes after I complained. I ate away the food while my coworker just sat there staring the walls. The food itself was so so. It might be ok for a quick snack, but not something to wait at the table for almost 40 minutes. And to try so hard to cover it all up with a lie doesn't help either.
This was awful. Loud, flavorless food, pricey. Also inattentive. Eating in this area is a struggle- absolutely no effort, sky-high rent driven by tourists results in a cool sounding place that is anything but.
"Bacon lovers unite! This is a bacon dream come true. Everything you eat and drink here has bacon!  Another bacon-themed restaurant I've been to is Traif, which is pricier, but very good. Bar Bacon is cheaper and much more causal than Traif. It was how I started my day. Yes, I came here for brunch. Every single brunch place in Hell's kitchen was ""clogged"" / crowded, so I went to BarBacon instead right when they opened to clog up my arteries. I started with a bloody mary, with bacon. There was a crispy strip of bacon in the spicy bloody mary. Salty and spicy, yum. I had the eggs benedict which consisted of 2 eggs over breakfast sausage bread pudding. It was served in a small rectangular casserole pan, with lots of... bacon! My dish was very greasy, my food was literally floating in half an inch of grease. Even though the food was decent, the oil was pretty gross.  They have a lot of delicious bacon filled snacks, which I would love to try one day. There are also bacon flights I think!  I was in a food coma after brunch, so I went to Kahve next door, which is an awesome coffee shop, to get some coffee to wake myself up!"
Odd mix of real highs and super lows. Snap pea cocktail at the bar called Half English was one of the best cocktails I've had in a long time. Just perfectly interesting, not too sweet, vegetal goodness with gin. Hostess found two spots for us with no reservations so that was lovely.  But dinner was meh. Some serious problems with oversalting food in the kitchen. One dish was so salty it was bitter and inedible. Probably the worst bite of food I've had in a long time at a restaurant.  Some good items in the various other dishes, but overall nothing measuring up to the high price tag. Some serious problems on the service side. Apps took forever to come out. Forever! Same with entrees. And they placed the wrong order for our apps, and then charged us for the wrong dish as well as the correct one on our bill. I was bummed because I was expecting a really nice indulgent dinner and it was the most boring stuff executed inconsistently.
Last night was my 34th birthday. We went here because of all of the great feedback we get from friends around the neighborhood. Unfortunately, they didn't prep the table, we didn't have any flatware or proper dinnerware at the table, the staff was sub par, and our server decided to leave half way through service without a word. The drinks were great but my food was ok at best. I lived in Rome for a while so I feel that I know how Italian food should be. That being said, a plate of green fettuccini soaked in truffle oil has never been something I had overseas. It was advertised as a wild mushroom fettuccini but it was really over cooked pasta in a fake truffle sauce. Mushrooms were barely recognizable. I would not recommend and I am sorry I wasted my birthday outing here.
Shes a Sugar Freak! Sugar Freak! Shes sugar freakkkkayyyyy!  Its a difficult task finding good ol southern creole or quality southern food period in Queens. Sugar Freak has been on my bucket list for sometime. So, after my friends and I left our Queens Yelp elite event, the down home cooking cravings hit. I spotted the creative sign and window from 30th Ave. It was a empty house due to the snow storm and aftermath of Valentine's Day. The decor is southern kitchen. There are alot of cool vintage items and abstract items thrown around. A collection of plates on the wall can be viewed towards the back of the restarant.  We were seated immediately and our menus were placed on a place mat with every President on it to celebrate President's Day. We studied the menu and my friends decided on Po Boys(Po(oor) Choice!) and I had the Crawfish Mac & Cheese. Whats unfortunate here is that Mac and Cheese is not a side dish. If i wanted a platter the side choices dont include Mac & Cheese. The service was fast and the servers were courteous. Nothing over the top. Our food arrived and my Mac and Cheese was creamy, cheesy and full of Crawfish! Worth the $12. Nothing else on the menu was eye catching. My friends Po Boys.....full of iceberg lettuce. Nothing exceptional. Menu was reminiscent of Bourbon Street in Bayside. Maybe I shouldve come for the Brunch menu...... The decor scores stars here. With the uniquely designed outhouse for a bathroom. Equipped with a chain to flush the toilet and an old Metal tin basin to wash your hands.
This place is great, it's usually full when we come so my husband I usually eat at the bar. The wait staff & bartenders are always friendly. And the food...the spicy fried chicken is amazing! This is good southern food, the sides stand on their own as well. We've been coming here for quite a few years and have never been disappointed.
I finally got a girlfriend to come with me to check out the restaurant after having bookmarked it a few months ago but our meal was terribly lackluster. We both ordered the sirloin steak medium rare. All the entrees came with two sides. The steaks came out, looking impressive, although our waiter joked that he looked for the smallest ones for us. (Or was it a joke?) My steak came out almost well done so that completely ruined the meal for me. My gf's was better but even she said that it was getting dry and tough as she ate more into her steak. Granted, we aren't at a steakhouse and we didn't order their traditional, well-acclaimed dishes, the temperature of the steak was just so off. The staff was pretty great though. We witnessed how they gave a birthday shout-out and it was the best I've seen done by a restaurant. The waiter who headlined it was very cheery and enthusiastic.
I visited this place when I was traveling with my gf from Los Angeles. This place just happened to be in the vicinity of the hotel that I was staying in.  You guys have the best lobster rolls. I've been to many lobster roll places. Famous ones and not so famous ones. I miss you guys lol. 5 stars.
"Greetings Soul Food Lovers, we were TOTALLY underwhelmed with the service provided by Jeremiah, as well as, the taste and presentation of the food. Finally, going to Sylvia's was a great opportunity to check the experience off of my list of things to do. As such, the experience was not enough to draw me back again. The wait time was okay; however, the hostess booth should be visible or directive signs provided to appropriately direct traffic. The table was next to the kitchen and that was the first thing to throw off my energy. In addition, I prefer cloth napkins for a meal at $20+ per person; however, I was told it was for Sunday dining. Our server was Jeremiah. Initially, I was excited as his name demands a certain character of a person. Wow! I was wrong. Jeremiah could use a refresher course related to providing exceptional service. His attitude was weak and inappropriate. In fact, Jeremiah's behavior and non-verbals suggested an offense that we were not amazed with the taste of the food. Perhaps Jeremiah is a descendant of the famous Sylvia.  The chicken breast was extremely dry and my daughter asked to exchange it for fish. She was hungry and hoped to remedy her own experience.  Actually, the fish was more expensive so ""he"" lost money. Jeremiah refused to honor her request and said she would get another piece of chicken only. Honestly, I have never had such service. I lost my previous appetite for peach cobbler to go. Simply put-we will never go back! Peace and blessings 2 U."
"I trekked all way from the city to come here to taste those ""oh so delicious"" soup dumplings... This is my second time coming here. I also got the chicken cutlet noodle soup for an astounding $9.85 per bowl and three orders of soup dumplings for take out. The fried chicken noodle soup was good but I didn't like the fried chicken siting on top a bed of noodles. Inadvertently, the breaded part turned mushy.  As I finished my $10 inflated bowl of noodles, I ordered a side of fried chicken cutlet to go but when I got home, I was disappointed to see they made the portions smaller since last visit. I don't think I would come back for chicken noodle soup - I also noticed they gave less noodles this time. I had the beef noodle soup last time and I liked it better since itwas more flavorful.  The place was packed from 7-8pm and takeout orders sitting on their counter waiting for the Uber delivery person for pick up."
Very rude service for no reason, much friendlier bars in the neighborhood. South, Freddies, Iron Station, Jeat Jet, and Quarter Bar are way more deserving of your dollars.  I don't think a place with decidedly condescending bartenders are what South Slope needs. If this place didn't have food and outdoor space no one would come here.
Different prices for different flavor wings means you can't just mix flavors like any other Korean spot you will ever go to. Pass on everything here then.
I can't believe I didn't write review about this restaurant since I've been here a lot of times already & this is our go to spot everytime we crave for soup dumplings or xiao long bao. My bf is the one who introduce me to this place long time ago. Most filipinos go downstairs of this spot but not a lot of us know theirs so much better upstairs.  Its hard to get a table for more than a party of 4. I observed they have 2 big tables that can fit more than 4 people but other than that theirs tables for regular group like 2 to 4. This place is not that big so dinner time we usually wait. I went one time with 5 people & waited 30 mins or more. Hard if you have kids with you coz they don't have waiting area & just wait outside. It can easily get pack. They accept cash or american express only.  For the food the soup dumplings or xiao long bao (crab or pork) is delicious! The soup itsef is so flavorful. We usually get a lot of appetizer & maybe 2 main dish. Try this tip & you will save $$$. Most of their appetizer price range between $1 to 3 so why not try all their appetizer especially for big party. We get shrimp siomai, scallion pancake, wonton in chili sauce, salt & pepper squid, porkchop & pan fried crispy noodles with meat or seafood. All of this is delicious! Trust me. Haha. This are usually my favorite. I'm not a big fan pf their cold dishes.  Good service & delicious food!
3.5 stars. Overall a really fun place to grab a drink or a late night meal. Great vibe and great service which totally outshines the food.  I came to dine here on a Friday night and the place was busy. Luckily a table opened up and my party of 3 only needed to wait for about 10 minutes. The service here was very friendly, waters were filled regularly, and we never felt rushed even though there was a constant line of people waiting for tables. The food, well very inconsistent ranging from poor to very good. I feel like they need to cut down on unnecessary items on the menu and focus on making their top dishes shine. On the plus side they are open 24 hours and they serve breakfast menus all day. Dishes I was able to sample: Sweet Potato Fries ($4.75) - 0/5 - a poor limp soggy excuse for sweet potato fries Mac & Cheese Chicharron ($9.95) - 5/5 definitely the highlight, I wanted a whole serving to myself Lomo Saltado, Peruvian Stir Fry beef short ribs ($19.95) - 3.5/5 - nice flavor and tender meat but overpriced for what it is Churrasco, Grilled Skirt Steak ($20.95) - 4/5 - tender and well marinated Chuleta Pork Chop Marinated in Adobo ($8.95)- 1/5 - overcooked and extremely dry Copa Lolita, vanilla flan, coconut & mango sorbet ($8) - 3/5 - I loved everything on this plate of dessert... just not together. the sorbet was so sweet and overpowered the vanilla flan. However, I will say that the coconut sorbet was the best I ever had.
This is my first review ever. I had to come and write one. The service in this place is mediocre at best. I got charged for items i did order but never received. I asked to get a menu from one of the staff and he completely ignored me. I tried their brunch. Food is decent, but portions are way small, and they seem to attempt a gourmet twist to southern cuisine which doesn't really pay off. Definitely not going back
I ordered a quesadilla with a side of guacamole from Toloache on Seamless.  It came cold.  But the worst part is that it was literally the smallest quesadilla I've ever seen - an open-face tiny tortilla with some cheese and a couple of corn kernels.  For $15!  I called the restaurant to inquire why my meal was so small and why Seamless didn't indicate that this was an appetizer and hardly a meal, and they were unapologetic.  I will not make the same mistake twice.  Will order from Blockheads next time.
Growing up in Brooklyn you had to have visited the juniors in downtown and get the cheesecake and on occasion eaten there. This new location is in the heart of time square and it's not as crazy crowded as you would think. I went for lunch on a weekday and was in and out in 30-40 minutes. I had their burger, as I always do at a Juniors, and is as I remember.  The prices for a burger is north of $10+  but you will be filled up. Good beer on tap and the service is prompt.
I mean, come on...this place is fantastic. If you're in Astoria, make sure you stop by the Butcher Bar and see if Rory is working. He's as good as they come: friendly, attentive, chill (I.e., does not laugh at our stupid questions and multiple requests). 5/5 Rory! The food itself was definitely solid 4/5. I ordered the Monster 50/50 which was drowning is mounds of brisket and pulled pork. The table is adorned with three different types of barbecue sauce so lather up your sandwich!  Though portion sizes were great, my brisket was a tad dry. If I didn't add BBQ sauce to my sandwich, it might've been too dry to eat naturally. Two other points: sides and that corn bread. Sides were on the pricey side and were not in great portions. Specifically calling the mash potatoes out since they were super runny. The corn bread was dry as well (and I love corn bread so that was a let down..) All in all, I'll be back again! To the Yelpers out there, make sure to look on Groupon if you're planning on visiting. You can try this joint and save some cash while you're at it!
This is my 4th time here in a couple of months and I am in LVE!! My beau enjoys the chicken and waffles and I have enjoyed the fish and grits. The biscuits are quite delicious and the banana cream pie - well let me just say I order an entree based on my need to have that cream pie when finished. Always phenomenal. The service is consistently great!! The lovely young lady who takes care of the seating list is always so very nice. Every time I come, she says she remembers me and actually has said my name on a couple of occasions. I just cannot get enough of P n Ts!!!!
Lure Fishbar is one of those incongruous places that you walk by and don't realize a fine restaurant is hidden below street level. We stopped by for Christmas Eve cocktails and since it was happy hour, ended up ordering many of the appetizers on the bar menu.  The standout was definitely the raw oysters at over half off a half shell. Although it was shuckers-choice, it was cool they didn't limit us to the basic Blue Points that NYC restaurants use for happy hour. The Shrimp tempura with spicy sesame mayo was also a standout app. The Crispy Calamari was not crispy at all, but soggy and had an unusual taste. The Blackberry Daiquiri was way too sweet for my taste, almost like drinking jam. The Spicy Paloma was much more to my liking with jalapeño agave tequila and red ruby grapefruit. I had two of them! Service was uneven and we had to reorder our drinks when they forgot. Even so, I'd probably venture back for a full meal. The raw bar looked good and the restaurant was full of holiday cheer.
So much great Italian food all in one place! We tried the pasta restaurant and it was absolutely delicious! I got the seafood pasta and the flavors were fantastic. I would definitely recommend this dish. Im looking forward to coming back and trying the pizza as well as all their desserts. There is something for everyone here, you wont leave hungry!
"I would love to give this place an actual review based on their food but this review is soley based on service.  My friend and I got there at 9:30 Saturday night and were turned away as they ""weren't taking any more names"" 2 hours before they closed.  We walked past at midnight after a FABULOUS dinner at LOUKOUMI which is right down the block."
Service was great. Unfortunately food didn't meet my expectations.  Ordered all four tacos listed on menu. They were very plain and bland. Fish one was okay. Would not order from here again. You can get better for less money.
Food was amazing and the price is extremely reasonable. From the decor to the tasty food right down to the staff was an extremely unforgettable experience. Finally found a new home
Vanessa's is cheap but quite below average compared to all the other more authentic Chinese dumpling shops literally on the same block. Go to Vanessa's at Union Square, but don't bother if you're already in the heart of Chinatown. Shu Jiao Fu Zhou on the same block as this Eldridge location is even cheaper and the dumplings are more fresh.
I cannot believe I wasted my time or money here. This one star is for the one good drink I had here! Before we came to the restaurant, we called and asked to make a reservation. The gentleman on the phone told us we could come right in, there was no wait. We told him we would be there in 45 mins and he said no problem. When we got their the hostess said all the tables were reserved we would have to sit at the bar. One table of people were eating, everything else was empty and said reserved. What kind of establishment doesn't leave room for walk in business. After huffing and puffing she sat us. (FYI by the time we left those tables didn't even fill up) and we were there over an hour) We ordered several appetizers. The sliders, rock shrimp, and wontons. The sliders tasted like dry burgers drenched in adobo, the rock shrimp was wrapped in undercooked bacon and slapped on mushy bread, and the wontons tasted like Tostitos spinach dip in a phyllo dough.  Main course I got the steak, which was good, but it came with dry bland rice. My fiancé got the pork Chop which was ok, but very small no flavor. My niece had the chofan rice, and it was like Chinese fried rice and nothing special. Even the chicken was burnt. My mother in law had the pasta which was swimming in oil. If you want real Latin food, go to a small local spot! This place isn't worth a dime of your money, even if you get the Groupon! That's why they need the Groupon to lessen the blow when you eat your food!!!  When the hostess saw me taking pictures for Yelp that's when she started being nice to us. Too late lady, I will never step foot in here again , even if you offer free booze with your check in! Don't be fooled!
If you are looking for a whitewashed version of Venezuelan food this is the place for you!  I have never been so disappointed in my life! The food in this place was a sorry excuse for Venezuelan food! I honestly wanted to go to the back and ask the Cook if he's ever even been in Venezuela!!  Man am I angry!  I came here on a date I blew up my people's food explaining how everything is cooked and the spices and everything (I'm born and raised Venezuelan) we both ordered pabellón... IT WAS SO DAMN BLAND!!!  And it doesn't stop there... The Sangria WAS ALSO BLAND!  Please do yourself a favor if you want to eat real Venezuelan food take the trip to Arepas Grill in Astoria. Now THAT is real Venezuelan food.  I'm done.
Very disappointing and a true tourist spot. I do love the history and the preservation, but the food was just bleh. Had the Margarita pizza and Meatballs. The pizza was very average and I would not call it some of the best in NY. Not even in the top 15. The meatballs were ok but not that fresh. They were out within 2 minutes of our order, so I think they just have them sitting there in a big container waiting and waiting to get pulled out. They have a full bar and I had the Sangria, also not that great and too sweet.   Cash only
One word - overrated. We came here for lunch on a Saturday, there was no line around 12:30pm. I got the lunch set with Zuke Don and Tokyo Chicken ramen, and the husband got the same Don and Tonkotsu. We also both got the Kakuni Bao.  The downside: Tuna on rice was a bit frozen for me to eat, and my ramen's broth was very bland.  The upside: pork belly bun was very fatty and delicious, and despite the tasteless broth, all the ingredients in there actually tasted of good quality.  Unfortunately if I compare this place to any other ramen places I've tried, this is at the bottom. Will not be back.
I was very excited after hearing a number of great reviews about eleven Madison park. With my expectations of my anniversary dinner high what occurred was a very uninspiring night. The first dismissed aspect was that there was a party of two seated near the entrance in jeans, t-shirt and casual shoes. For a 3 Michellan star, their dress code standards are very low. Our party of 4 made the effort to suit up and dress up for a special occasion and experience.  When we first arrived we were seated by a gentleman who he acknowledged us of our wedding anniversary, as a restaurant with the prestige of Eleven Madison Park the least I expected was a surprise dessert or even an acknowledgment of our anniversary at the end of the night, we got NOTHING. The level of service went down hill from there.  The level of service that we received was worse than a fast food chain, as you can feel from the waiters that they didn't want to be there. Some examples were when placing our knives and forks they were dropped onto the table, plates being removed on the table when the whole table has not finished their meal and numerous times waiters leaning over you to pick up your plate. After a hot summer day we were seated and served warm sparkling water, which was unpleasant.  These are situations you would not expect from the number 3 restaurant in the world. It's such a shame as the food was actually enjoyable.  On a brighter side the interaction of the menu was pleasing with the picnic, BBQ fruits and also the chocolate guessing game which took our minds off the service. All in all it would be hard to recommend Eleven Madison Park to others as I do not want my friends to go through the unexpectedly bad service. For the restaurant to be successful and to be known as one of the best restaurants in the world management needs to train their staff better and professional to all customers as there were a few tables who were non Asian beside us and you could notice the level of service was 100 times better. Maybe the removal of gratituity has dampened the service with unmotivated service.
I ordered for delivery and boy was I disappointed! The pizza was cold and seemed old! I also ordered a Nutella cake and it was a whole bunch of scraps thrown together which I payed 6 dollars for!  I had ordered from here before and was very happy! something must be going on, new management or something. Highly disappointed!  I should of known not to order, my friend recently said he went there and got treated poorly!  DONT ORDER HERE! If you want to have a good experience.
A good eatery. A bit small but not many places, but overall a great place to eat burgers at low prices.
Last minute reso from DINR and this place was a hit! Plentiful food and very well priced.
I've eaten here in the past, the food did not stand out. Went back last sunday for a drink at the bar and found the bartender to be really rude and unpleasant. Drinks were decent but not worth going back for given the lack of hospitality.
The food was okay, but the portions sizes are so ridiculously​ small and expensive for what you get that I cannot recommend this restaurant.  Too bad, because the room is bright and pleasant enough.  The appetizers are particularly minuscule.  When I discussed potion size with our waitress, she call them Manhattan portions.  i don't know what that means, but it almost comical, except that it isn't
Order the Capricciosa pizza for pick up . The pizza was very burnt that all I saw was compete black ashes on the bottom. One of the worst pizza I have . I couldn't taste anything since the burnt taste overwhelm the pizza. The picture looks great on Yelp but my pizza was soggy / undercook but with brunt taste.  I wouldn't try pizza from them again but I might try the pasta.
One of my favorite hole-in-the-wall restaurants to visit in Chinatown for the experience (it has two levels, both of which are very cramped, and is located on an irregular L shaped street that feels like its the site of a Triad den in an old school HK crime drama), for the tasty, chewy, gummy handmade noodles, and for the fact that there is a BYOB option here. My favorite thing to start with, especially in the hot summer months, is the spicy cucumber salad, which involves smashed cucumber (like you'd find in some sort of artisinal mixologist's cocktail) in a bed of spicy oil and sesame oil, so that it absorbs the flavors. The steamed dumplings are good but nothing noteworthy.  The main event are the noodles. I like the thick, knife cut noodles, dry sauteed with chicken and shrimp. The noodles are perfectly cooked, a fine balance of the soft exterior and slightly chewy interior. The flavors are simple and fresh and delicious.  As mentioned, there is the option for BYOB, although figuring out what wine to pair with Chinese food can be pretty challenging.  I recommend to any friends looking for noodles in Chinatown. Service is generally competent and speaks English well enough.
I got the pork banh mi sandwich after diligently searching on yelp even though there aren't that many reviews on Saigon shack for pork (red flag).this was the driest(forget banh mi)sandwich of all time. The slaw wasn't  chilled like it usually is. I got my sandwich spicy but the only spiciness to this sandwich was when I bit into a jalepeno, on top of the dryness of the sandwich-not pleasant. I looked in to see if there was any dressing and there was no evidence of that or if there was it probably got soaked into the bread. Didn't enjoy my meal.
Crazyyyyy busy and for a great reason - the food is pretty delicious. Highly recommend the fried artichoke... It's amazing! Pray you don't get that back table against the walk and by the bar. Every staff member will bump into your chair, shoulder, and ponytail, and won't apologize.  They will also grab your plates before you're even finished, which I REALLY hate.
$16 lunch set ramen and don rice sets. Good food, would be a good lunch spot if it weren't so packed, but no competition for the likes of Ippudo and Ramen Lab in terms of actual food quality and innovation. I give them props for making their dishes so instagrammable though with the branded nori seaweed, that is a smart business move on their part. Seats are communal and our table wasn't wiped before we were seated.
My friend and I had a glorious and gluttonous time at L'Artusi tonight. I must warn you; as two fairly small girls under 5'3, our eating styles mirror those of 240 lb linebackers . Please do not be alarmed but this is what we ordered: House ricotta with butter crackers - 5/10 ricotta was rich but the accompanied marmalade and crackers too sweet Roasted mushrooms - 9/10 get inside me Tagliatelle bolognese - 9/10 Bavette with clams - 7/10 tasty but I feel like the pasta wasn't fresh Quail - 8/10 mmm Octopus - 3/10 tiny and dry af. We normally like this! What happened :( Hanger steak with crispy potatoes - 8/10 yuuuuge! Crispy potatoes w the spread were amazing. Hanger steak is what it is.  Olive oil cake - some parts were too salty and some too sweet Hazelnut chocolate torta - mmm We had the best time! Ate for almost three hours straight. Come to think of it, we could have done without the unmentioned loaf of bread to start - that's definitely what did us in.
Felice is a cute Italian restaurant in the Financial District.  It's probably more of a 3.5 than a 3 in all reality.  The restaurant itself is a nice date place - it's quiet and dark with small tables and candles.   We went on a Saturday night as walk ins.  Although we called beforehand to see if we could be seated, they didn't really seem sure if they had space when we got there (why wouldn't they just tell us to make a reservation?) however they did have room and we were seated immediately.   Our server greeted us right away and was really nice.  The whole staff was very attentive (constantly filling waters etc) which I liked.  We split the gnocchi special (with mushrooms in truffle sauce) and the fusilli with Burrata and tomatoes.   The gnocchi was good (big gnocchi which were pillowy and very fresh mushrooms) but the portion was fairly small.  The dish was $24.  We enjoyed this but wished it was a little bigger.   I ordered the fusilli which I enjoyed.  The sauce was sweet and fresh and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.  The Burrata's consistency was a little thin for me, but overall I enjoyed our meal.   We were in and out quickly and our whole bill came to just under $50.  While I liked what we got and would come again, nothing really blew me away either.  It was a good, reasonably priced meal - probably one of my favorites in FiDi.
This two star rating is about the absurd pricing, not the quality of the food or service.  I gotta say $17 for a banh mi sandwich, no matter how delicious, is absolutely absurd.  And no, one doesn't get soup or salad or dessert with the sandwich for the $17, it's a $17 banh mi sandwich. The more I think about it, the more absurd it sounds.  I am used to spending about $4 for such a sandwich in San Francisco (just as delicious) and when I saw them for $8-10 in the East Village (just as delicious) I was taken aback.  Selling them for $17 at a location in a barren industrial wasteland of a neighborhood that resembles where super-villains might hole up in their lairs -- broken streets littered with glass, broken sidewalks, rickey foot-bridges over disused train tracks, waste management-related businesses all around -- is robbery.
Came in the middle of the day when it was burning hot out. I've heard a lot about roberta's so I figured coming from ridgewood, why not stop here on my way home. The waiter was kind of just okay. I really have no opinion of him, a bit stand off-ish but he kept refilling he water which was great. While I liked my cheesus Christ (??i think) pizza, I added mushrooms and it totaled 18$ which to me is a bit much for what ended up being a personal pie. It's a good place but I wouldn't go out of my way to try it and certainly not wait any amount of time for it
It's really kind of sad, this used to be one of my favorite eats in the city back around 2013/14 but over the last few years the trend in quality and taste has gone done while the prices have gone up. The noodles are more gummy, the sauces lacking that same amazing flavor, the stewed pork burger fattier and fattier. My monthly fave is now just not that exciting anymore. I always get the N9 Pork Zhia Zhang (spelling) noodles and the B1 stewed pork burger. The dish used to come with some amazing broth in the plate but no longer. The burger used to be juicier and not as fat. This last time on two separate bites I had a mouthful of fat. And with the dish my wife always gets, the spinach dumplings, which have taken on a chemically taste of late, and a chrysanthemum tea (still very good) our dinner, which used to be around $21 is now closer to $27. Nostalgia won't last forever so I don't know how many times I'll be going back, if again.
I went for the insta, but I kinda wish I hadn't stayed for the food.  I came by fairly early (a little before noon) on a Saturday and there was no wait at all! My group of 4 was seated in a few minutes and our food came pretty quick after we ordered.  We shared a Cookie and Cream shake which was more than enough for the group (these things are as massive as they look on the internet. The shake was average, a little watery and way more for appearance than taste. The cookie sandwich on the shake was just one that you could get from an ice cream truck. Warning: the whole things starts to melt and get everywhere uber quick so beware.  I had the falafel burger with avocado which came with fries. The fries are super fresh and hot and kind of large, but not particularly note worthy. They use those hipster looking glass heinz ketchup bottles which makes actually getting ketchup out next to impossible! Like geez louise the whole ordeal was over the top unnecessary.  My review is super biased because I'm a vegetarian, but I found the falafel burger very meh, a little dry. The toppings didn't quite all mesh that well and I was craving some tzatziki the whole time. I also had an onion ring and there was very little batter and the onion still had some bite, which I actually found unpleasant, but that's more of a personal preference.  Overall I wouldn't crave anything in particular from Black Tap. Their service was good, there's solid options on the menu, but if the line's crazy know that you're not missing out on that much.
I really like Tanner Smiths. It is a multipurpose cocktail bar/restaurant- great for an intimate date, a solo meal or after work drinks. I love their fries and their artichoke/sundried tomato dip. I've had the hangar steak with brussel hash (pictured) which was very good. The drink menu comes in the form of an eclectic and extensive little booklet, which the libation lover in me can appreciate. Solid spot!
This place is probably better than everything else in the area, but that isn't saying much.  The portions are big, but the flavor and ingredients are just ok.  There is much better Greek fare (and other fare) elsewhere in the city.   Something that bothered me was freshly squeezed OJ was listed on the menu, but when I ordered it, I saw the juice being poured from a Tropicana carton, and then watched it as it was delivered to my table.  I then asked the waitress if it was freshly squeezed, and she said it wasn't.  Why write that on the menu?
Came here on june 1st with a friend and ordered a scallop appetizer, miso salmon entree and a tuna entree. The scallop was mediocre. While the miso salmon was delicious! The flavors were all there, would recommend this dish hands down. But unfortunately, i had a bad experience with the tuna. The tuna looked black. Doesnt look like the other yelp reviews so i asked the waiter if the fish was fresh or not. He went to the kitchen and came back saying it's fresh, it came this morning. The reason why it looks like that is because the color of the tuna is different. I looked at my plate again and just couldn't take a bite. I returned it and ordered a miso salmon instead. When the miso salmon came, it came raw. Sent it back again and got a nicely good salmon. Too bad it took over an hour to get it right and i was already too hungry to eat anything. I tried my best to finish my dish and paid the bill. I still tipped 18%to my waiter as I know it's not his fault. His service was alright but could've been better. Would i come back? Probably not.
Party of 6 with a reservation and our meal from beginning to end was torture. We spent over 2 hours dining. The service was slow and waitstaff was inattentive. Ordered 2 charcuterie and cheese plates for the table of 6. Had to ask countless time for more bread because each time they would only bring us 4 small slices.  Waitstaff never asked if we wanted another drink. Had to flag a waiter down each time and wait 10-15 minutes for each glass of wine or beer to be brought to the table. Our entrees were ordered at the same time as our first round of drinks and appetizers and took over 1.5 hours to arrive at the table. I only think it arrived within that time frame because we asked twice after the appetizers and another round of drinks were served how much longer for dinner service.  Not to mention the food quality was not worth the money. Probably the smallest oysters I've had. Texture was squishy and dry. Cute neighborhood and ambiance but does not make up for the cost, subpar quality, poor service and the wait.
When I was told that we needed to get to Hometown well before 5pm on this spring-like Saturday afternoon, I didn't quite understand. I thought, okay so it gets busy to be seated. No, no, no. We arrived to a line wrapped around the space of about 50-60 people. I was told that the wait from a point a bit in front of us was about a half hour last time. So we stood there and waited. We got a couple beers during the wait and fawned over those who had already gotten their food. About an hour later it was finally our turn to order our food. We went with the brisket, pulled pork, beef rib, pork ribs, a sausage and an order of ribs. For sides we ordered the mac and cheese, whiskey sour pickles, potato salad, beans and cole slaw. (FYI it was 4 of us). Our food was put out on the tray fairly quickly and we got to our table that we had been saving since about 20 minutes into the wait.  Everything looked so delicious it was hard to decide where to start. I went in for the pork rib--the very end that had such a burst of flavor--I put some sticky BBQ sauce on it and it was perfect. The Brisket was next, amazing. A perfect bite of fatty and lean in each bite that you could tell was smoked to perfection. Next was some pulled pork. Perfectly flavored. The beef rib was delectable. Melt in your mouth good and smoked! My favorite side was the mac and cheese. The rest I could take or leave. I didn't personally have the sausage or wings but the way they were equally devoured tells me they were good.  Bottom line. Don't come here hungry. Come mildly ready to eat and by the time you get to the front of the line you'll be starving. Make sure you come ready to wait with an open mind so that you don't get hangry during your wait. Until next time, I'll just cherish the smokey scent that is sure to linger on anything that was with me.
This is a review for a few weeks ago. My friends and I are here on the suggestion of one of their boyfriends who had eaten her previously. I checked the reviews on Yelp, and honestly was kinda hesitant to go in the first place, but I didn't feel like putting any extra energy into choosing a new brunch place so whatever. Mistake. This place has mediocre food, for ridiculous prices, and worst of all the service was TERRIBLE. TERRIBLE! They wouldn't sit our group of 4 until the whole party was together (the restaurant was not busy but I get policies so nbd). Once we were together tho we just chose to stay at the bar, which was another mistake. The bartender was not attentive, rude at times, and barely going through the motions. Instead of making sure her only four guests were well, she would stand on the other side of the bar chopping apples until we flagged her down. I am also a bartender, and when I see that there's very little reason or excuse to your bad service it just irks me because... like why? So finally we're ready to leave, we ask for the bill to be split in two which was met with an attitude. Then we when all receive our checks we noticed a gratuity has already been added. We asked why and she said because we as a group sat at the bar and our bill was over $100, an automatic gratuity of 20% was added to the bill. TWENTY PERCENT. So you mean to tell me you sit back relax and do jack shit and just rack up the tips? Lol as a bartender myself I would like to work here so I can collect my coin. I can see why they have that policy because I was definitely going to leave the bare minimum of 15%, which is saying a lot industry wise. What an awful experience at a mediocre place man.  My advice to anyone going to dine here, DO NOT SIT AT THE BAR. It's a scam and not worth the money. For the prices and fees they charged I expected to be serviced and impressed by the food. Not disappointed and irritated the whole meal lol
I really like this place! I definitely see why I keep on coming back. I made a reservation for 6 PM on a Tuesday for two. We arrived approximately 10 minutes early, but were seated immediately. They gave us plenty of time to look at our menus, and discussed happy hour options for us. I got the pad Thai, which was delicious. It's definitely not like the street pad Thai I've had in Thailand, but it's a great twist to it. Has the perfect amount of sweetness, and you can't really taste the strong peanut flavor in the sauce. There are plenty of options in the menu, so there is definitely something for everyone! In addition, the prices are very reasonable for the Hells kitchen area. I ended up paying around $16 for my whole meal with tax, which is incredible! The bathroom here is pretty cool as well. It's on the same floor that the tables are at, but it's a sliding door rather than a pull or push. It definitely got busy around the time we left, but definitely a place I'd come again.
Not sure where to start but this was by far my favorite place to eat on my trip!! I could not stop stuffing my face because the food was just that good! I highly recommend the chicken and pancakes!
I've been coming here many times already and I'm very disappointed, the food is not what it used to be, my Tajine was anything but a real Tajine. The waitress is very attentive and courteous but although important food should be more important. I'll give them one more chance and if they don't get it together I will stop coming. Luckily there's plenty of restaurants in the city. Oh! Did I mentioned what is supposed to be a Rice Pilaf is nothing but long grain white rice?!!!!!. So disappointed!!!!. :(
I've been a loyal customer for over 7 years now. Yesterday however it was somewhat horrific how the hostess treated my friend and I. We requested a table for 2 on the patio at 7 and she said it would be around 20 min. So we waited outside for 20 minutes. We saw a table clear, when back in after we had waited 20 minutes. She then informed us the party of 7 who had just arrived asked to be seated on the patio, so she could only give us a table inside now. We basically had to leave. This is unacceptable behaviour on the part of the establishment. You are turning away loyal customers to make quick money. Anyway I hope this was an off thing and that hostess is duly informed this is incorrect behaviour.
"Surprised by the strong reviews.  It's... fine?  I guess?  Really 2.5 stars, but rounding down because it's not a particularly good value.  I went with my girlfriend, and we weren't hugely hungry, just looking for a chill place to have dinner in the neighborhood on a Saturday night.  The bartender recommended the steak and brussels sprouts, both of which we ordered along with a beet salad.  Thoughts: (1) Bartender was a nice guy and recommended the type of wine we were looking for--turned out to be a Rioja--but the wine itself was only okay (and we tried a couple of different glasses of wine).     (2) Crowd at the bar was atypical.  Everyone else was a guy in his 40s or 50s, which, you know, I hope to be myself someday, but it's not necessarily what you are expecting.  Bar was also lit unusually--harsh white light.  Why would you do this?!? (3) Steak was somehow *under*.  I personally prefer that to over (heck, I like slightly below medium rare), but it really was still mooing.  And super salty. (4) Brussels sprouts were your standard ""let's add a lot of oil and cheese and bacon to this,"" which is always hugely disappointing to me.  (5) Salad was actually super good.  Maybe the key is to go light and fresh here, which is usually more my speed anyway. (6) Lots of what we saw coming out was heavy and fried.  Maybe that was just a reflection of the folks around us, though.  See point #5. Bottom line is that there are far, far better spots."
Second time here.  We were heartbroken a while back when we found our beloved Jolly Monk had closed since we moved from the neighborhood, but we've been pleased with our meals both times.  The staff is friwndly & attentive, the decor is nice, food is really good, & my daughter loves that they play Cartoon Network on the tv's, rather than sports.
This place used to be so great. Now it's barely 1/3 full for Saturday brunch. A great place to go if you want to wait a mysteriously long time for rare steak while watching Argentinean waitresses socialize with each other and ignore your table for 30 minute stretches at a time. And the guacamole is flavorless with barely a pinch of cilantro and ridiculously priced at $9 for a tiny cup!
This quaint, trendy, cafe styled, breakfast place is a must see!  Our party of ten took over this entire place and they were almost perfect with accommodating. At first we ordered a few bottles of champagne and some orange juice- they kept trying to get us to order mimosas individually even though full bottles were on the menu- which was the only set back. However, they agreed to let us do what we wanted and turned a negative into a positive right away.  Dish after dish was stunningly beautiful in color and extremely tasty in flavor. Everything that came out was amazing. They have this green sauce that is a mix of jalapeño, creamy deliciousness that was not too spicy at all!  I had the breakfast bowl which was fresh and filling. They gave such a generous portion of avocado it was almost as if there wasn't a shortage! Don't mind it.  The hostess made our experience so great and the waitress ended up being very sweet after we assured her we wouldn't be spilling orange juice all over the table. We brought a little Cali style brunching to soho and Jacks Wife Frieda delivered.
"Went here for dinner tonight, I specifically asked the wait if the vegetables had mushrooms because I am severely allergic. Waiter told me no. When the plate came out, over half the plate has mushrooms -_- I received a simple sorry, it's not my fault it's the kitchens fault... when someone tells you they have a severe allergy, you double check! Of course when I asked for a manager one was not working on a Friday evening. My fiancé sat and ate his meal, his plate was clean before I got my ""second try"". Never received an offer for something else, money off the bill, or anything. Very disappointed in my first visit!!!"
3.5 Stars This place has dim lighting, an upscale look, and a upbeat musical vibe in the background. There's an open kitchen in the back but you can't see much unless you're sitting on the back bar chairs. The olive oil which came with the complimentary bread was good, quite fruity. The la tur cheese (combination of goat, sheep, and cow milk) was smooth, creamy, and light in flavor. I liked the fruit jam that was paired with it on the side. Both jam and cheese were good on thin crackers. The roasted mushrooms were quite savory with the pancetta, and I enjoyed it paired with the texture of the sunnyside up egg. I liked the sausage and broccoli rabe cooked with the caviatelle. The pasta itself was al dente, I liked the pasta less. The charred octopus had a soft texture, not that chewy was paired with small slices potatoes and cooked green olive parts on the bottom. It was good but didn't wow. The hanger steak was my least favorite dish, the center of the meat was practically raw. The large roasted potatoes on the side were decent with sprigs of rosemary. The olive oil cake was excellent, mild taste, nice, light texture with some powdered sugar on top. I didn't really need the creme fraiche or golden raisins in syrup on the side. Overall, I thought this place was overrated, it was good but there were parts of each dish that I wasn't too fond of. I think the roasted mushrooms, and olive oil cake were the best out of the above, and the only two I would order again.
"This was a pleasantly surprising experience! We were just in the area and starving, and we came across this little joint. It's very casual... So casual that there are no seats, LOL. I was a vegetarian and there was only one option for me. The grilled cactus tacos/quesadillas/plates. Vegetarians should not get the ""plate"" option because the beans have pork lard. The staff was knowledgeable enough to inform me of this before finalizing my order. I was very appreciative of this because many restaurants don't know these details about their menu and people end up breaking their dietary restrictions. The tacos were delicious, especially after adding the numerous sauces on their sauce wall. My fiancé ordered pork tacos (adobado) and he loved them as well! Overall the vibe is very friendly and chill. Additionally, it is very affordable. But do not come here if your legs are aching and you want to place to sit down. Highly recommend!"
This is a popular restaurant located in a trendy area with quaint shops and several eateries.  We ordered the old fashioned, which is a rectangular pizza. Each topping costs extra, so the price adds up quickly. It can easily feed 3-4 people. We were told that the crust for this type of pizza was the same as their round pies, thin and crispy. Not true - this crust was much thicker. It reminded me of a Pizza Hut pan pizza crust. The pizza was flavorful, but it wasn't anything special. I was disappointed that the crust was so much thicker than we were led to believe. If you are looking for traditional Neapolitan style pizza, this is not the place for you. Also, pizzas are pricey here. Unfortunately, the Financial District is slim pickins for traditional Neapolitan pizza.
"True hidden gem!! I've seriously been missing out. I've worked in the area over 4 years and recently discovered this place. It's situated between two bonds bail locations and can be easily missed, if you're not paying attention. Now on to the food... Pure awesomeness!!! I ordered a mint lemonade and ""Breakroom Fries"" which consisted of seasoned fries(well done), tater tots, bacon bits,cheese, onions, and jalapeño peppers. The serving sizes are decent, surely they can be shared between two people. Granted you probably shouldn't eat here everyday, but definitely my top choice for a cheat meal day :). Not to mention, that everything is reasonably priced! I've been told the tacos are equally amazing.....I'll be trying those out next."
I ate the Unagi bowl today but it wasn't that attractive... The sauce on the rice was sour, on the unagi is a bit little for me. The flavor didn't help on the Unagi... I could get something way better than it with the same price... didn't worth the money$20..
I came here for brunch. The DJ was great. He played music that you could enjoy singing along to. Maybe even get up and two-step a bit. Lol. Our menus were paper menus so they were dirty with spills and normal wear and tear. I think they should reconsider their menu because the paper thing with no plastic doesn't work unless they plan to constantly print new ones out. Also, when we first came in.. It seemed unorganized. We waited to be seated but then I guess we didn't have to because a group after us just came and sat down. So then we sat a table but it took a while before it was cleared. The food was decent and the drinks were great.  It definitely has some potential with some tweaks. There aren't many places that offer brunch and a live DJ in Brooklyn so I think it's an opportunity this bar can capitalize on, especially in that area. All in all, I would come back on a laid back Sunday morning.
Was excited to go to this restaurant because of watching the show diners drive ins and dives.  Saw them prepare Arizona con polllo.  Chicken with rice with a whole chicken.   Preordered the dish and when we were there and getting the dish we were very disappointed to see that there was only 4 pieces of chicken in the a big pot of rice.  For $30 was totally disappointed and would never return nor recommend to anyone.
I ordered the sausage omelette that came with cheese grits and you're chose of white or wheat toast with a side salad and the broccoli.  I loved it !
"I never write reviews, but after this experience, it was totally necessary. I've been here 3 times before and I used to think it was an okay restaurant with decent food. Not anymore. We ordered the Lechon Kawali, Spicy Laing, Grilled Tuna Belly and the Kalderata Kabing. As I placed the order, I went straight to entrees. The waitress asked if we wanted appetizers and kind of nudged us a bit to get, which we denied. This already kind of rubbed me the wrong way. We get the food. The Lechon was awesome and the Spicy Laing was delicious. The Grilled Tuna Belly was overcooked and the Kalderata was mostly bones and not really tasty. The portions are small, even for a Filipino restuarant. We ask for 1 more scoop of rice, but they give us a full bowl which is probably 3 scoops. We let them know, but they say ""you can have it"", thinking we wouldnt be charged for the extra. We ask for dessert and we order the Halo Halo and Leche Flan. When we recieve the dessert, we still had all of our empty plates and bowls. The server who brought the dessert and two others saw this and passed by without a second glance. Finally, a 4th person saw and took away only half of our stuff. 5  minutes later another person comes by to get the rest and finally asks us how we are doing. 2 more people come by as we are eating dessert to see how everything was. This is after it was difficult to get anyone to notice us earlier. After we ask for the check, the server has the nerve to ask if we could pay the tip in cash, so as to split it among the workers. I do not understand how anyone has the audacity to basically ask for tip, especially after the horrible service we were given. I pay the whole thing on my card and walk out and dont plan on ever coming back. Btw, we got charged for 3 scoops of rice when I had clearly asked for 1."
This is without a doubt, the best soul food I have eaten in my entire life.  Once seated, you are welcomed with a basket of warm, fresh cornbread with butter and a honey glaze. I honestly do not know why I didn't order chicken and waffles. I think it was because I wanted to get in to some sides, I ordered the Reggie Harris (honey fried chicken). I got cheesy grits and yams for my sides. Perfectly crispy chicken with outrageously delicious sides. My husband finished his Jamaican jerk shrimp so fast I couldn't even sneak in a bite.  The service was a delight. Warm and friendly staff made this meal that much better.
"This place is walkable for us in one of our favorite parts of the village. Love the ambiance and the fact you can sit outside. A little tight table to table on the inside. The food overall was good. My sea bass fresh although slightly bland.  My husband enjoyed the tasty bourbon meatloaf. Where this place falls short is the service. They tried to take our food order before we even ordered our drinks. Then they asked us if we wanted bread but it didn't come until our dinner was served. Which was like 10min after we ordered; way to pace a meal!  Then we kept having to flag our waitress down for additional drinks. And when I asked for more evoo to go with the delicious bread the ""bread server"" had quite the attitude and dumped the oil on my plate (it is Extra Virgin restaurant, right!) Had to struggle to get the check. Not sure we will go back."
Very unimpressed by this joint.  Came here for my friend's birthday on a Friday night. Luckily, we had missed the lines that formed as soon as we got in. Restaurant is huge; we got seated in the back. The waiter forgot to come by our table to get food/drink order for a long time. We had to hail a waiter to come and get us water. The menu is simple, which I appreciate.  We ordered a large pizza and it was awful. The crust was not crisp - it was on the verge of soggy and the sauce did not taste fresh. This restaurant is popular for a reason but I would definitely not go here again.
This is the WORST WORST WORST restaurant that I've been in Chinatown. The lady who's taking the order has a BAD BAD attitude.  If you don't speak Chinese she will give you attitude. We ask question about the portion of duck and what comes with it. She keeps giving me an answer with attitude and shaking her head and most worst of all she turns around and talks Chinese and shake her head again. I was so upset to this lady. I just walk out from this restaurant after my husband place his order. If you are not Chinese DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT, you will have a bad day!!!!
So far so great! Tacos are on point, you can relax and chill to the music in here. Mexican Corn is delicious. Tomorrow we gonna try the Burger
"This place was recommend to me... Said ""Raquel its so your style"" BOY BYE!! I heard there was a new cook, everything we had was disgusting ""yuck"" the pictures do a ton of justice for this food. To each its own, but this food was horrible and the atmosphere was blah it looked nice YES! Just like that Mac and Cheese did and made me stomach hurt. Plus what is up with those Chips they give you with BBQ Sauce ""yuck"" THEY ARE HARD AS A NAIL and the seasoning is weird... I am still disappointed thought this was gonna be my new spot... THANK GOD FOR PROSECCO THE ONLY THING GOOD I HAD Oh and that Rose Sangria?!?! People must not drink and or know good Alcoholic that crap is nasty... some people need to not try to mix things, CLASSIC RED LEAVE IT ALONE!! XoXo *frown*    PYT"
Ordered shrimp dumplings, beef brisket duet noodle soup with fish balls, scallion pancakes (omg you have to order), and shrimp dumpling lo mein. One word - bangin.  Oh and I ordered cold soy milk to go.  Definitely coming back..
The food here taste close to the real Chinese food but there is still room for improvements. I agree they could use much less cooking oil. Over all, 3.5 stars is quite reasonable. I love the lamb stew (i made up that name, cannot remember what it was called. YangRouPao)
Calle Dao opened in the neighborhood recently and we'd been wanting to try.  We had a friend over.  I called and they said they had a table so we walked over.  We definitely didn't need a reservation as the place was barely half-full.  It's a nice location and space.  The staff was nice.  The food was fairly average unfortunately, given how intriguing the style and dishes sounded.  Probably won't be visiting again though they do have an oyster happy hour, so we'll see.
One of the best BBQs I had. We waited for 40 mins in the line to order our food and I have to say the food was worth the wait. I ordered short ribs and brisket and both turned out amazing. I also had beans, pickles and potato salad as sides. Similarly they were amazing. I have to say it is more on pricey side but with the quality comes a cost. Will definitely come back again
I've had Atlantic Salmon which turned out to be almost the same as Glazed Salmon at BJ's. Quite surprisingly, I liked the chain version at BJ's a lot more. White Oak rendition's Asparagus was old, couscous very sour (?!), the salmon was just OK. Although the food was disappointing, the service was impeccable.
I can here after work to hit up happy hour with one of my friends in the city.  Drink specials were pretty great, with wine for 4$ and sake for 3$, and the sushi we ordered was passable... The space is loud, boisterous, and fast-paced, but sometimes that's what you need after a long day in the office. Overall, pretty good experience, but not my favorite by any means
I came here several years ago for dinner and it's been on my agenda since to make it back one day for brunch. I finally made a reservation on Thursday for Sunday at 2:30pm. Although I would love to return, I feel the closing of brunch here was extremely tacky (yes, tacky). Pros Great table Awesome waiter- sincerely friendly and honest about the dishes (likes and dislikes) Amazing complementary mini muffins and bread Cons Sat down at 2:30pm and within 10 minutes was told the kitchen closes at 3pm  Ordered before 3pm and while eating and enjoying the food...music gets cut off  3:30pm- lights get cut off (they literally turned off the lights while everyone was eating) 4-4:15pm- the check arrives and before we had a couple of minutes to stop conversing and look at the check, a manager arrives to ask that we move to the bar because they have to prepare for dinner Moral of my review: I wanted a good experience, but we were rushed through the entire brunch! There's got to be a better way.
Quality thai food in Flatiron district.  Nice decoration, great food. But a little pricey. Thai ice tea and desserts were good too. Worth a try!
"NYU buildings loom in the border of this, ""Hey, are we in Jekyll and Hyde, because it's really dark in here"" kinda place. The food was not remarkable, but it was decent.  My husband and I had salads, burgers, and some drinks.  I ordered the ""ancient grain"" salad and it was not overly generous with the tasty ingredients (avocado, almonds...) but the tamari dressing was ""I think I would try to duplicate this at home"" good.  The Burgers were alright, not enough toppings or enough meat, in my opinion, and served on a wooden plank in an effort to make everything look bigger.  We were initially seated at a dinner table, but after waiting over fifteen minutes for someone to take a drink order we got up and ate dinner at the bar.  I don't think I would bother going back here.  The laissez faire attitude of the staff and what we received for the price do not justify a second visit-- NYC has better offerings."
I don't know what I was expecting but it wasn't great. I guess I'm just one of those shake shack groupies. The burger seemed bland with no seasoning, my husband and I likened it to something like smash burger (ouch). The ice cream was good tho!
Delicious, yes please. I would totally go back. I have also recommended this place to many people. Homemade pasta and completely reasonable prices. The service was also awesome. I hope this place survives, located at a really ugly spot. lol.
First meal after I landed in new york. I was craving korean food and this place had good reviews so I checked it out. I went before peak time so I got seated right away. I ordered a fluke (which is kind of like the flounder-fish). It came with veggies, rice noodles and fluke. It was good because I wanted something cold to eat since its so hot in new york right now. I think its way over priced for what it is and how much I got ..It was just p ordinary imo.
Came here for brunch with my sister since we were nearby looking at an open house, we got seated right away but the tables were kind of cramped and there was really no place to put jackets and our bags.. Good thing it was pretty empty on a Sunday afternoon so we had the table next to us to put our jackets and stuff. The waitress told us that they didn't have everything on the bunch menu and no skirt or hangar steak?(2nd option on brunch menu) my sister was disappointed since that is her favorite item on the menu... I ended up ordering the first item on the brunch menu and it was pretty much eggs Benny over rice and beans with a little veggie on the side... I didn't really like mine... Way too much beans and too little rice the egg did not have much flavor but my sisters ribeyes was pretty good she ordered medium rare and It came medium well but the sauce was good and it was much better than mine.. Was not my favorite brunch experience and probably wouldn't come back but the mimosa was good!!
The last time I had Halal guys was in 2011. It was a blisteringly cold April and the warmth coming off the chicken and rice was like a hearth for my soul.  I don't know if the quality has gone down since then or if my soul is now colder than a San Francisco June, but Halal guys just did not do it for me.  Yes it's still chicken and rice and white sauce but there's just something lackluster about it all. Except the hotsauce. That stuff is explosive. Beware.
With the history of this place, I expected it to be better than the place next door.  I came to NYC on a pizza pilgrimage and had decent expectations for Juliana's.  I was disappointed.  Ambiance, decor, and service were just fine, but I really don't care about that when I'm here for the pizza.  If you serve me the best pizza in a cave, that's better than average pizza in a palace.  But I digress...back to the pizza. It comes down to crummy dough.  It had no flavor and bad texture.  This above all else ruins my pizza experience!! Sauce, cheese, toppings and all that are high quality and great.  However if you give me good toppings on flavorless crust, it's over.  Maybe they got into their dough too soon, or maybe proper fermentation isn't important to them.  Either way it simply wasn't great pizza.
A very disappointing experience in Lil Italy. Very mediocre and bland food. We were told that everything was made fresh on premises by the greeter who talked us into eating there on the sidewalk. The bread was not fresh and tasted store bought. We had the eggplant rolotini appetizer which was dry and tasteless. The sauce was of a jar quality. I had the chicken Parmesan. It was dry and bland.  To give you a better understanding, both my grandparents are Sicilian. I won't say that I'm an extreme connoisseur of Italian food but I expected a lot better from a Little Italy restaurant in New York.  The following day we ate at Olive Garden in Time Square. It was at least a star or 2 better and less expensive with more atmosphere.  Sorry La Bella, but you are playing a game with tourists.
I really love it here. The lobster roll with bacon and lettuce and tomato is fantastic, as is their lobster macaroni and cheese, and so are their fried pickles and sweet potato fries and potato salad -- these are my frequent favorites, but even their fish and chips are terrific. Will be back often.
"I never go on yelp to write reviews, I literally have only done one other review in 2014 because I felt so strongly about the place. That being said, I am writing this review only hours after leaving this place, because that is how horrible and upsetting my experience was.  Upon walking in, there was a bouncer at the lobby of the hotel. He was not friendly whatsoever, but that's not unusual. He did not even say hello. That was fine. My boyfriend and another couple we were with were excited to check out this place, as we heard it had nice views. We got upstairs and it was definitely a sceney kind of place. It seemed okay. Our waiter that came over was nice and was the friendliest face we had seen so far. We ordered drinks and then were sitting and chatting.  All of a sudden, a bouncer is walking by us and eyeing us. My friend and I look at each other a little confused, but we continued chatting. Then we realize he is still just staring at us with a smug look on his face. He comes over and gets in our faces. He says he needs to see our IDs. Not our dates, just me and my friend (the girls). We already had our IDs checked before we even got upstairs, and we are all legal. We told him this, and he continued to get in our face and tell us he doesn't care. He is laughing in our faces as if we are nothing. At this point my friend and I feel so incredibly uncomfortable and demeaned, our dates are telling him to leave us alone, but he won't walk away. I shouldn't have but he made me feel so nervous, I handed him my ID and he said he was going to go downstairs and be back in 5 minutes. This is where I really couldn't handle it anymore. He thinks he is going to take my license and go downstairs? When we didn't even need to be giving it to him in the first place? We told him we were not comfortable with that and then he replies like we're crazy, ""are you okay?"" No.. I'm not okay because I'm out for a relaxing night and I'm being harassed. He shined his light on our licenses, grinned at us and then walked away. My friend and I have never felt more uncomfortable when going out, especially to a place that supposedly has a good reputation. Even after he walked away, he was still standing a few feet from our table, eyeing us with that smug look on his face.  It was so bad, that we were going to leave even though we already ordered drinks. We did not want to be there after this experience. We told our waiter the situation and that we understand it's not his fault, but that we really feel harassed and do not want to stay here. He felt extremely bad and actually gave us our drinks for free, and told us he wanted us to just stay for that since they were already ordered. We did stay, but the night was ruined. I saw our waiter telling what looked like the manager and other coworkers what had happened. The waiter was very distraught over the situation and genuinely felt bad.   This bouncer (I wish I knew his name) should be fired. He made our experience horrible, and for that reason I will never go back to this place. If it has such a good reputation, let's see how they handle this man and if they continue to have him working there. Hotels have systems for a reason. No one should go out for a pleasant night and get picked on or harassed. That's not what I'm out for."
"I will never go back there again! I do not usually write comment of any businesses but there is something I have to tell. Actually, I did not want to give even 1 star, however, I have to because I am not able to write review without making any star. We are looking for a place for our company party and the restaurant is near our office so I and my colleague went there to check if the restaurant is good for the party. I made a reservation for us at 8:15pm. When we were there at 8:15pm, I told a manager in the front((owner?) our reservation name and time and he told us we have to wait and the seat will be ready about 15-20 min. We understand some times we can't get seat on time of the reservation and we have to wait to be seated especially busy weekend, About 20 min later, the seat was not ready yet and the other two customers came in. They told the other hostess who was also in the front their reservation at 8:30pm. 15 min since the two party came in, we are still waiting for the table standing near front door next to the hostess and the manager, we double checked again to the hostess that our reservation name and time and asked how long it will take to be seated. She checked their reservation chart again and told us it will be ready about another 10 min. We waited another 10 min and some tables were cleaned up by the waiter and prepared for the next costumers one by one. Finally another table was ready, there is our party and other party who came later than us were waiting near the front door. I and my colleague were both think that we could finally take a seat however, the hostess showed the table to the other party instead of showing us. We told her our reservation was 8:15pm and we came before them and she told us unbelievable excuse! "" Oh, I though you walked in and waiting for the table without reservation""　I dropped my jaw! It is so obvious that they gave priority the party over us on purpose . I refused to believe as we gave our name and time of the reservation to both manager and the hostess and when we asked our waiting time once a while, they checked our name by with their reservation chart. They both knew our reservation. We just walked out as we thought that the restaurant is not worth to spend even a penny. This restaurant take the order of priority based on their personal opinion, not ""reservation"". It really look like they prioritize white groups and never care beside of that. It was such a ridiculous and rude service I ever had in restaurants. I will never recommended this restaurant, because you will have to have unpleasant feeling caused by such a ridiculous things in a weekend that we supposed to have a relax and fun time."
This place was ok. I ordered the tonkotsu ramen and the zuke maguro. Ramen: The broth was ok. The noodles were ok. The pork was not ok though, it lacked flavor and it was also cut pretty thin.  My friend who has been there before mentioned that the portions we got that night were smaller than usual.   Zuke maguro: This appetizer dish was the highlight of the meal! It was spicier than I expected, but the tuna and the sauce went really well together! They should make a noodle dish with the sauce! It was so good!  I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 4 because the ramen is supposed to be the highlight of this place, but the appetizer stole the spotlight. Hahaa
Went there last week for dinner. Great lamb chop special, salad, key lime pie. It was crowded during the time we were there so im guessing thats why service was compromised but other than that would return.
Prices are not really worth the quality. Three friends and I came in for dinner on a Tuesday night at 6:30. We didn't have to wait but the place is pretty big, and I'm not sure how busy it gets on a Friday/Saturday night. Service was quick - the food came out pretty quickly after we ordered. I went with the Uni Cream Udon in hot broth. There was one piece of uni on top in the middle, and that was pretty much it. The broth didn't really taste like udon, more like cream. In fact, it was a little too creamy and heavy. It should have been called 'creamy udon with a singular piece of uni on top' instead. It definitely wasn't worth the $24. Their other menu items seemed pretty pricey as well and I'm not exactly sure why. It's not like Tsurutontan is fine dining. IMO, you can get the same quality for a lower price tag elsewhere.
"This shop is a great place for those who wants a burger near the district that wants a real burger and not that 1/8 of an inch patty***.  They have a wide selection of tacos that you can choose from.  Recommendation - 3 taco platter(must get the fish). Best spot in Chinatown for fish tacos.  Tip- the fries are good when you need that fix. Forget the shop two blocks down, come here for the fries. You will not regret it, I ""pommsfrites"" it(bad joke, I apologize)."
I am from Taiwan and always in search of good Taiwanese food, which unfortunately is nowhere to be found in Manhattan.  On my way back from JFK, my kids and I made a pit stop in Elmhurst in search of a good Taiwanese restaurant.  What a disappointment!  We got the 3 dishes, soup, and rice combo.  The squid soup was horrible.  The squid was very fishy and the soup was overly think (too much cornstarch).  We got the kidney, clams, and three cups chicken.  Everything was brown, salty, with too much vinegar, which is really not authentic because Taiwanese cooking should not be too heavily seasoned.  I really regret not going to the Taiwanese noodle place that we passed by and debated trying - Happy Stony Noodle, instead!
By the time I arrived I was absolutely starving, hangry even. We got a table for two, I ordered the Rev. Al Sharpton, fried and with dark meat. He ordered the Dr. Walter Delph- a seafood platter with fried shrimp, catfish, and crab cakes. We split side orders of fried okra, collard greens, and string beans.  The seafood platter was very nicely done- ask for cocktail sauce! The shrimp were especially good, nicely sized with a flavorful breading.  The fried chicken is good. Not the best I've had, but it was up there for sure. Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. The waffle was like air. Butter it, pour some syrup over the chicken and the waffle and have the whole thing come together. They don't offer just the waffle on it's own, which I think is a little silly. There's no way to just add on a waffle to an entree that doesn't include it.  The sides were great. I didn't see any ham hock in the string beans but I could swear I tasted pig product in there- yum! The collard greens were perfect. The okra was definitely the standout- amazing! I got some cocktail sauce to dip it into.  They have a Koolaid of the day lol, the day we went it was grape.
The prices are ridiculous for the amount of food they give you.  I ordered the grilled octopus appetizer ($17.00 WTF! I better get at least three arms off this octopus) and a Greek salad ($13.00 this better be a big ass salad!).  Well as far as the grilled octopus appetizer went, I barely got one arm, but they compensated with a whole grilled onion.  I am not shitting you.  I posted a pic.  There was practically no octopus.  It came with very finely diced and cooked red pinion, and then to mask the fact that you are getting practically no octopus, there was a whole grilled onion in with it.  Cut in big, half inch pieces. Some grilled well and some barely cooked at all.   Now on to the Greek salad.  Feta cheese should be the center piece of any Greek salad.  The salad should rich in tomatoes, cucumbers, red opinions, kalamata olives and beautiful and bountiful feta cheese.  A big ass block of feta cheese.  I got two small pieces.  If I put them together they would have still been smaller than my thumb.  I've got small hands to boot.  Not to mention that the salad itself wasn't enough for one person.  AND I GOT THREE GREEN OLIVES WITH PIMENTO!!!  What!?!?   Those shitty olives.  I posted a picture of the salad too.  If you really want good, plentiful Greek food in Forest Hills, at a decent price then I suggest Agora Taverna, or Nick's Bistro.  If you got wheels then head to Taverna Kyclades (top notch), Astoria, or Greek Grill, Howard Beach.
I decided to come here with my mother on a Saturday night. It's in a quiet area, attached next to a hotel. There's not much else around it. It was empty-ish when we walked in. We were seated near a window and tended too pretty quickly. The table next to us were displeased with  the temperature of their wine, which made me nervous for the rest of the night, but I didn't really need to be. Service was pretty good, mostly attentive and very courteous. My only gripe was maybe the lack of communication between different servers when they took away certain silverware and plates we needed for different courses.  We had the calamari salad hand rock shrimp. Both very tasty. I had the Galbijjim, while my mom had the the Coq Au Vin. The Galbijjim came with shishito peppers but that wash it. i wish it came with rice or another side. The coq au vin was great. We split a duck bibimbap and loved it. The mojito was pretty okay. all in all, I had a solid time here and would consider coming back. The layout and design was great. If it had felt more lively, I would've really enjoyed my time here. The food is really worth trying.
"I'll try this place again, maybe on a Monday for the oyster special and have a flatbreads. It was ""ok"" to say the least, while our waiter was friendly she seemed like she didn't want to be there. The food came out way too fast- but then again the place was empty on a Saturday night.....My Husband ordered the flank steak (med-well) and it was rare! I got the shrimp pasta dish and it was ok, tad too rich. The overall feel of the place and menu seemed good. Since we just moved around the corner we were hoping for more of a local go to place. We will try again however."
This is no Palace.  Upon arrival I was greeted by dirty utensils (Chopsticks), tasteless soup, a pork bun with the paper so stuck to it that me and my daughter (6) both ate it, and disgusting steamed sticky rice with pork rolls made with canned meat and scraps.  I would imagine this is what Aria serves her special pies (GOT reference).
Lovely dinner spot. We were slightly crammed in as it's a pretty small restaurant, but the food was worth it. I loved the tar tar and the sea bass. We tried a couple of the cocktails and weren't super excited about them- the apple cider was served lukewarm and was too sweet. All in all a great evening and I look forward to coming back for brunch!
Decor: 3/5 -Appears to be a fancy seafood restaurant but the booth cloths were dirty Service: 3/5 -overall decent but he ignored our table for a while -the water boy was great at refilling our glasses though Food: 3/5 -Four pieces of fried chicken at $25? Save your time and money and go to Bobwhite in Alphabet City. -The skin was good and tasty but the meat was dry.
"Service: 1/5 My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday night around 8:30pm so there were quite a few open tables. Our waiter seemed so irritated from the very beginning and it was off putting. He never smiled, asked us how we were, nothing. Just wanted to take our orders quickly and get out of there. He also had a thick hispanic accent and it was loud in the restaurant so we struggled to hear him. We started off by ordering wines. I asked for one of the sweet white wines, but he told us that they ran out. Okay, that's disappointing but it's fine. We then ordered our entrees and I ordered the linguini with clams. Apparently he misheard me and thought I said spinach gnudi??? Not even close. The spinach gnudi came out, and wow, it looked horrible and was probably about 3 bites of food. I quickly called him back over and told him that I ordered the linguini. He immediately started blaming me. ""Oh I repeated your order back to you and you said yes"". Okay well there was definitely some miscommunication there, it was hard to hear him. I asked if I could still get the linguini that I ordered. He rudely replied that I could if I paid for both dishes. He then continued to explain that they would have to throw that dish away because they can't re-serve it and he'd have to explain to the chefs why they need to make another dish for me. Okay... well I think that's pretty standard for restaurants. I sure hope that you don't re-serve it to someone else. After trying to make me feel bad about this whole mix up, he realized that I wasn't going to accept the dish. So he brought it back to the kitchen and about 5 minutes later brought out the linguini dish that I had ordered. He ended up not charging me for the extra dish, probably because it makes no sense to charge a customer for a dish that they didn't order or touch and he didn't want to get in trouble for being an idiot. Food: 2/5 They seemed to have randomly threw together my dish because the presentation was horrible. The pasta was all over the place and they threw a wilted piece of basil on top. The pasta was overcooked and the sauce was bland. There were only a few clams, and one of them was unopened. Such a rookie mistake to serve an unopened clam. My boyfriend got the orecchiette and it was okay, but nothing special. Pretty pricey for mediocre food."
The restaurant feels like an authentic udon shop from Japan with a few stools nestled along the wall and 6-8 small tables for 2-4 people. The restaurant takes names/cell phone #s for the queue and will text you when your table is ready, so that's very convenient. Overall experience was 3 to 3.5. The fried chicken was delicious - extra crispy on the outside with a light misting of fresh lemon juice to cut the deep fried taste and had a moist interior - a little pricey for 6 small pieces ($7).  The udon itself was a really great texture - chewy yet soft and had slightly fatter ends giving the appearance that these were fresh probably not handmade on prem but not dried. The broth for the highly reviewed beef/tripe dish was a bit lackluster. There was definitely hints of benito flakes, soy sauce, mirin/sugar as part of the base of broth but not much other flavor beyond that. The meat and tripe was very tender and there were nice large pieces of both.  The shrimp tempura udon broth was a bit lighter than the pork broth but had the noticeable bonito flake flavors as well. The egg udon had an extremely thick and gelatinous sauce which didn't have much flavor - add some of the spicy table salt/flavoring to help give this dish a boost. On the plus side, the egg udon came with a lot of noodles. The bowl appeared to be completely full of noodles!
Once again at this place for brunch, this time left way less impressed. They are very proud of their Cuban sandwich, which is really something else.  However, also ordered a chorizo con papas, which might be traditional (I have no idea) but regardless was very greasy and not tasty at all. The grilled corn is average and arrived lukewarm. Service is ok and the place is busy.
I don't want to give even one star.  They are open for dinner, but they don't even have a proper dinner menu. There is no main dish that you end up spending so much money for tapas. And their tapas are so small, so expensive, it takes too long to serve. Waiter service is horrible.   It took 30 minutes to take orders and the first tapas was one hour later. AND IT IS JUST A TAPAS. I left the restaurant with really bad feeling, and we ended up having a real dinner at different place. The taste is not bad, I can say it was good, but if you wait for 1 hour for 1 little tapas, everything will taste good.  If you are thinking about going for a dinner with your friend, just go to other places and maybe come here when you are full - you know what,  just don't go.  There are more places worth spending your time and money in the city.
"Butcher bar, I wanted to love you so much :( The ambience and the service was fantastic - Southern BBQ meets trendy LES vibes, but the food for me was average/above average at best. Food and drink menu is extensive, and the restaurant is sizable so big enough for large parties. *FYI - meat candy and ribs were sold out by the time we arrived at 8pm on a Saturday. Ordered the BEEF CHILI and PORK BELLY to start, both of which were underwhelming. More than half of the pork belly pieces were pure fat, but the dipping sauces - the sweet&spicy and habenero - were the saving grace. I wouldn't order these items again. For entrees, ordered THE MONSTER sandwich - easily the best thing I had that evening; super tasty. And the MOPPED and CHOPPED - also good. The sandwiches were the stars of the meal, but the sides weren't good supporting acts. The MAC & CHEESE was bland and not cheesy (the beef chili was cheesier) and the BEANS were too watery. We got a complimentary dessert - BOURBON BREAD PUDDING, which was bangin; definitely up there with the monster sandwich and highly recommend.  Based off of this experience, not sure if I would return, but since key items like meat candy and ribs werent on the menu, probably will. Hoping for some more ""umph"" next time around."
The first time my boyfriend and I came here, we absolutely loved it. Everything was great - the staff was friendly and helpful, the environment was inviting, the food was delicious!  However, the second time we came here - it was awful. We were seated right away and were told ice cold water was on the way. Twenty minutes later we received lukewarm gray water. The waiter only wanted to take our drink order but we'd had ample time to look over the menu and decided in what we wanted. Fifteen minutes later we got our drinks and he still didn't want to take our food order. After another 10 minutes he came back and talked over us while we ordered so he confused every single thing we said. Our appetizer finally came, immediately followed by our mains. The bus boy carelessly pushed my plate onto the table spilling my drink ALL OVER ME and continued pushing my plate and staring while the drink spilled!!!! While I was in the ladies' room cleaning myself off, my boyfriend had to ask TWICE for someone to mop the floor, clean my chair, or even bring napkins!! I had to finish the meal sitting in a puddle, while the waiter reminded me multiple times that my drink would be free!! He also continued to inform me of the spill and made it seem like it was MY fault, and NO ONE APOLOGIZED!!! I also had to finish the meal with my boyfriend's silverware because no one brought me another set after my soaked ones were taken away. And to top it all off, the food wasn't even half as good as last time. This poor rating is due to your awful, unprofessional and rude staff.
Food is gross and the service was bad.Great drinks tho.The collard greens didn't taste fresh or the smothered chicken.Wont be back
"Uva is open until 2:00 AM and I love that.  We actually chose Uva as our dinner place *because* of their late hours.  Our evening event ended so late, our options for eating out were somewhat limited.  BURRATA W/FAVA BEANS (3/5)  Not a great start. This burrata wasn't as soft and creamy as others we've had.  Completely edible, but def not a great example of what burrata can be. GRILLED CALAMARI SALAD (5/5) I don't think the menu has this listed with the word ""salad"" in it.  But it's def a salad and the grilled calamari is the star, as it should be.  GREAT salad.  Would order again and again. VEAL MEATBALLS (5/5) Not the over-sized kind, golf ball size.  Good texture, better than most restaurants do - not over processed. SCALLOPS WRAPPED W/PROSCIUTTO (3/5) Loser dish of the night.  Didn't care for the overpowering saltiness of the prosciutto, and the scallops didn't ring my bell.  Would not order again. GNOCCHI DI RICOTTA (5/5) Star of the night.  Yelpers got this one right.  This is the must-have dish on the menu.  Please ignore all reviewers that talk about this dish being ""overly rich"".  That's not the case at all.  Yes, it had a rich taste but it comes off actually light.  I could eat the whole plate myself and I can't do that with rich food. Order this for sure.  Maybe as an appetizer to share for the table. So, 3 of the 5 dishes we ordered were fab, and the other two weren't so hot.  Still, I'm a fan of this place.  As I mentioned earlier, their late hours are a huge plus, and the fact that they're putting out great food at those hours is commendable.  Go and get the Gnocchi!"
Not gonna lie, I wanted to come here mainly for the interior decor.  We made a reservation for 6:30PM on a Wednesday night and when we got there, we were seated right away. The restaurant itself was smaller than I had expected but I loved the atmosphere. The decor was so cute and the restaurant was lively.  We ordered Curry Puffs for appetizer. It was SO good. The outside was flaky and the inside had a thick mashed potato consistency. The sweet onion relish sauce went really well with it. The Pad See Ew was my favorite. The noodles were well cooked and definitely flavorful. We also ordered the Red Curry and Pineapple Fried Rice. I'm not a big fan of curry because of the coconut-y taste but it was pretty good! And you can't go wrong with Pineapple Fried Rice. The chicken was a little dry but overall, it was delicious! Everything we ordered was really good and flavorsome. We split 3 dishes among 3 people so we had a little bit of everything. The waitress was also really sweet and very attentive. Constantly refilling our water and asking if everything was okay.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this place. The ambiance makes it perfect for a date night
Aside from the amazing view, can't help but agree with other Yelpers. This place needs to hold itself to higher standards. Ordered the Avocado & Chickpea Dip with Crudite and Chopped Salad. The dip was absolutely delicious and the chopped was as well, however, it's not a traditional chopped salad which would be nice to have known when ordering. Our server only visited when taking our order and all appetizers came out prior to our drinks which was, in my opinion, poor serving etiquette. The drinks were delicious once they finally arrived which was after we finished eating. Overall beautiful locale but overpriced for no reason and service can use a kick in the ass!
Ambience and service was good  This place is pretty overpriced and my Arctic char was so salty I didn't even eat it. Would not recommend coming here. I hope the owner reads this and hold back on the salt! #highbloodpressurecity
The atmosphere is nice and you will see a lot of people waiting outside. However, the flavour did not excite me at all. The broth had a weird taste to the dish in their FAMOUS Momofuku noodle and their Chilled Spicy Noodle was not Spicy at all. The cucumber salad is not enjoyable at all. It has a less than appetizing. Also the Ginger Scallion Noodles was too salty and tough. The pork bun was soo salty to the point my mouth was dry. The only dish that was ok was the potato salad. Only because everyone can make the potato salad that taste like the one that you buy in the supermarket. I saw a long line so I thought should try it. So I waited an hour and a half to be dissatisfied.... So if you don't mind waiting along time for food that you can cook better at home, this place is for you! Enjoy!
Came to Root & Bone for restaurant week dinner. We had a reservation and yet still had to wait 20 minutes for our table to be ready.  We tried many dishes between four of us but only a few stood out as stellar. The biscuits with chicken gravy were buttery and fantastic, as was the crispy, moist fried chicken. I also loved the smashed potato side dish (not offered through restaurant week menu, so we ordered it additionally). I would go back for these three dishes but the rest was not memorable, including the deviled eggs, gem salad, peach/burrata salad, mac and cheese, watermelon salad, and the desserts. Seems to be very hit or miss at Root & Bone.
Had a Reservation in this restaurant for a valentine's day celebration with my girl friend. The space is small, tiny tables and is packed. Sign of great restaurant usually like typical of Williamsburg restaurants. When we came, greeted with host and proceed to our table. We came like 6:30 and the next hour line is already formed. What a place. They took our coat in conscience to save some spaces so we agreed. Did not knowing that at the end we have to find our own coat hung with others and you know who put it there and i dont know where is it. Lol We proceed with some drinks a margarita and some fresh strawberry cocktail. A bit strong but its great! We ordered steam muscle and chicken liver for appetizer. The muscle sauce was okay and the liver was great.  Main course we ordered the famous skirt steak and a lobster dish on valentine menu. I wish more sauce at skirt steak and saltier like a cute salt and pepper shaker will do. The best part is crispy baked potato. Not sure how they do that but i was amazed. Crunchy outside soft inside, well done!  My girlfriend had a lobster with a creamy sauce mixed with cheese like on flat pie plate form accompanied with fried cube potatoes with assorted edible flowers. The lobster is delicious but the sauce is too creamy like after the fourth or  fifth spoon it become too creamy taste.  We didnt order any dessert because we were to full Overall its a busy tiny Uruguayan restaurant food is okay great place for date night. We loved to find a hidden gem in Williamsburg. But maybe we will pass on this one. But you should try it at least once.  By all meaning its depend on your taste. We may come back but not in short time.
This is hands down my favorite bar in the city. I've avoided posting this review because I don't want everyone else to know how good The Alcove is, but seriously, it's phenomenal: the atmosphere, the hospitality, the drinks, the food. The Cuban is delicious, and the truffle fries are consistently good as well. This is a gem of a restaurant / bar.
Decently good ramen at a pretty good price. Tried the lunch special which included a small ramen, small don and a side of pickled cabbage for $16. The tonkotsu ramen was pretty flavorful with a hearty thicker broth. The pork pieces were thinly sliced, which I like. The zuke don was fresh tasting though maybe a bit salty. Pickled cabbage was fine.  Has a trendy atmosphere. Service was extremely friendly and prompt.  Overall, enjoyed it and am happy I went, but in a city with so much exceptional ramen, it didn't stand out to me enough to want to return.
The food here is decent. Ribs not cooked fresh off the grill actually premade and then cut to order, the brisket was arguably decent but the wings and sausage shined. So why the 2 stars? Well for a place with no servers the service is awful. I sat at the bar and had a rude bartender Laurena who thought that comping an over priced drink was price enough for her rude service no one seemed to work as a team and the heavy set bartender with the cheap tattoo parlor chest piece couldn't wait to fit in and show some attitude too. Go to Dino instead. Better food and service. Pigs beach is the Applebee's of nyc bbq and please some one tell them to revamp their poor cocktail menu and get better whiskey if possible teach your bartenders people skills.
If you're going on the weekend, make a reservation. The place opens at 10:30am and the crowd is already out the door. My friends and I decided we wanted to try this place based on the raving reviews on Yelp. We had a reservation for 10:30am, and were seated immediately. Ambiance is nice, service is friendly, but in terms of the food, the general consensus is that it was very underwhelming.  We ordered: BEIGNETS: Too doughy and not hot. POACHED EGGS (w/ mushrooms): The concept of this dish seems intriguing, but the execution was not. I'm somebody that likes my food on the lighter side, and even this dish was bland for me. Also, the poached eggs were overcooked so the yolk was not oozing over the food. HUEVOS RANCHEROS: If you like all your food mixed together, this is for you. I was expecting the flavors to be more rich, but the dish was pretty flat. Also, the eggs were overbaked, the yolk was light yellow. COOKSHOP BREAKFAST BOWL: The egg was prepared well for this dish, but the dish did not come together well. It doesn't say it on the menu, but there's a lot of cumin!  Overall, our experience was not the best. The best item that we had on the menu was the DRIP COFFEE (which is really good!).
Best tasting menu I have had for $50 per person.  I have had tasting menus at the $125-150 price range that I did not like as much.  They brought out 9 tapas plates plus several small desserts.  All plates were all well prepared and plated nicely.  The flavor combinations were pretty spot on for each dish.  I was quite impressed for the price point. Service was good and friendly.  It is not polished to a Michelin star level; however, the food is definitely comparable to places with a star.  I would highly recommend this place if visiting Williamsburg.
After eating here I told everyone I know about this place....because it was that good!!! Arrived here on a Sunday around 2pm and the wait was 30 minutes long.  The waiting area is small so if it's cold out, good luck.  The service was great though while waiting.  We were served complementary white or red wine while we wait.  Can't beat that! Eats: - Complementary bread with olive oil was really good - Fried Cheese amazing cheesy goodness.  Got better as it cooled down - Grilled Octopus was just the right chewy, perfectly grilled and olive oil drizzled upon completion - Peasant salad, delicious.  The freshest produce and feta was used.  For a party of 2 the small service was more than enough.  We took some home - For the main dish we had the Grilled Calamari with a side of lemon potatoes.  Perfectly grilled whole calamari, would definitely order again.  I wasnt a fan of the lemon potatoes, it was simply cut potatoes with lemon. - Complementary dessert was so good we asked if we can order one to take home Likes: - Service was on point - Food was just delicious - Complementary bread and dessert - Prices are decent - Didnt get a chance to try but the fillet fish looks amazing. Tips: - They do not accept reservations so be ready to wait. I believe the wait on weekend nights can be up to 2.5 hours! Yikes, but it's worth the wait.
Service is excellent, the waiter that served us and the receptionist lady was great! Food is not as good as I thought. It's a bit loud for a high class restaurant. It's a very popular restaurant. Our reservation was at 5:15pm, finished tasting menu at 8ish. We got a free cake because that was my friend's birthday. I'd recommend people to go try still.
This is one of the more overhyped places. Three stars goes to mostly their service, as our water was constantly being filled, but the food was ok: not mind blowing or amazing or anything like that.  This is one of the places that I would not make a trip to come back to because it's just a regular lunch spot. Guess most ppl just come here to get Instagrammable food pics and because of the reviews on Yelp. Honestly I don't know why or even how this place got 1000 stars+ review, it's overpriced, the food ok (my local pizzeria's food would satisfy me even better) and portions are very small. I wouldn't  recommend you to come here unless u really wanna pay $15 for two poached eggs.  The food was honestly just so underwhelming. It wasn't bad, it's just for $12 the portions are way too small. Honestly, I wold rather just pay $3 to get mcdonalds instead
Walked in around 715pm on a Thursday night with a friend and were immediately seated. Good thing we arrived when we did because by 730pm there was a line outside! We started off with 2 glasses of wine and then took a bit longer to peruse the menu/ask the waiter for recommendations. We decided to go with the kimchi paella, popcorn chicken, angry sweet potato, and the plantains. All of the dishes were REALLLY REALLY DELICIOUS and had a special flare. Thurs kitchen is such a fusion between korean, american, seafood, spanish so the flavors are v unique. My favorite dish was probably the kimchi paella since I've never had anything like it. The angry sweet potato was pretty spicy so don't order if you can't handle the burn.  Next time I come I want to try the light up cocktails (was running a marathon in 3 days from this dinner so didn't want hard alcohol). Would also love to try the gnocchi and the truffle mac and cheese as they both looked bomb at other tables.
First, we're being rushed for most of the meal. Then comes paying the bill...  The nerve to count how much we paid in front of us on the table.  I didn't have enough cash (52¢ off from total bill with 15% tip) and as my GF was searching her purse for cash, the waitress was impatiently asking if we're done yet.  I was like actually yes we're done. The waitress then walks off and comes back one minute later to remind us how much is 15% tip. She then began counting one bill at a time in front of us.  What was most surprising to us was that the cash she returned us was one dollar less than what we gave her. My GF kept asking me if she counted right. I was like forget it just give her the extra dollar.  She needs it. FYI there were a lot of empty tables.  Did not see any need to rush us during the meal.
Food is on the sweeter side. But never mind a great simple menu for entry level western foodies. Service is beyond impeccable, very tending and intimate staff.
GO TO BOSTON MARKET INSTEAD!! This was not good BBQ. The chicken was dry and barely warm, and the brisket was also dry. The music was much too loud and to hear each other we had to yell. This wasn't worth the money, so if you want BBQ  go to Boston Market instead. Only giving it one star because the drinks we got were good.
"This place did not live up to the hype. Talk about disappointment! From the cold stares received from the staff once we set foot through the door, to the rude and snarky comments about us taking pictures of our food. We were seated at a small bar table, which could fit a max of 2 people, we were a party of 3. I kindly asked the waitress if we could combine 2 tables and the waitress replied with a condescending tone, ""if we get busy, we will have to take one of the tables away"".  Our waitress was constantly in ""ALOOFland"", she could not be bothered with any request. It took exactly 47 minutes for our food to come out, not once did the waitress check up on us. At this time the restaurant was only 1/3 full.  On a slightly lighter note, the brisket was good, but the poor service ruined the overall experience. I recommend going elsewhere."
I really wanted to be blown away by this place, but I just wasn't. The restaurant was far too loud; I could not even hear myself think. The Turkish tea was not strong at all, tasting like I was sipping on sweet water. I thought the hummus would be great, but the texture of it was rather thick and it looked soggy, the hummus also did not taste so fresh. The tavuk dish I had was ok-- the tavuk(chicken) was kind of hard and overall unpleasant. What I did really like though, was the baklava the added strawberries on the side are an excellent touch; the taste of the pistachios with the strawberries are a great pairing!
Came here on a Sunday afternoon to give this place another try after a mediocre dinner experience a year ago. Food is expensive and barely passable. $12 for three, small fish tacos. Totally not worth it! The side of yucca fries took a long time to come out, so we were surprised when they arrived lukewarm, soggy, and dry on the inside. (Perhaps leftover from last night?) Coffee was $3, and tasted cheap. The service was the only real redeeming quality - the waitstaff was attentive and friendly. We live close by, but do not plan to come back.
I am fan. I was introduced to crawfish 1-2months ago a prvt event and since then I've had the craving.  A friend decided we should visit the boil. They have 2 locations and I have been to both. I prefer the larger location (NOT the LES one) where they take reservations.  The watermelon drink is delicious and very refreshing. I have tried a few drinks not the menu and they have no disappointed (i.e-I have only tried the sweet drinks). Staff were always friendly and they can show you who to eat the shellfish if you are  a novice. The first time I was here the space was perfect, 2nd time the sauce was a tad too salty for me. I guess it depends who is mixing the batch that day.  My recommendations- The watermelon drink Snow crab leg Boil marinade-Spicy Oysters Mango Papaya Salad Fries  I tried the mac n'cheese and was not impressed.
Price is fair.   While I appreciate the roll not being drowned in mayo as others I've had around the city, I do enjoy SOME seasoning and mayo.  All 3 rolls in the Noah's Ark had ZERO seasoning, mayo or butter on the roll.  Fail.  Also, not a place to drive to.  Impossible to find parking, and almost every surrounding block is under construction.  Walk.
"As an Indian this restaurant doesn't have any authentic flavor you would typically find at s good Indian restaurant. It works for non- Indians that cannot handle to much spice or flavor. It's like ""Tex-mex"" for Indian food. I wouldn't eat there again."
Went here for brunch during vacation and absolutely loved it! It's a bit pricey but it's worth it. We sat outside and our waitress was very attentive. They offer distilled and sparkling water for free, which is refreshing. Everything on the menu looked tasty and I will definitely be back. The atmosphere is trendy and open!
"Place is okay overall. The Decor is 5 stars, very cute hipster looking spot with cool lighting fixtures. They do not currently have a liquor license yet so can only serve wine and soju drinks, which were fine and not mind blowing. Overall good was fine, entrees were definitely better than the appetizers. Overall I thought the food was over salted. Asian fusion places are difficult to rate fairly in my opinion because the fusion aspects often dilutes the best parts of the cultures they are trying to blend. In this case, don't expect any of the usual pickled small dishes. Nothing here blew my mind, I give it a solid ""eh"" take it or leave it. We were a part of five so we got 3 apps to share and 3 entrees. Appetizers: Goat cheese terrine was intense and did not come with any sort of bread or crackers to eat the terrine with....so you expect people to just eat a slab of goat cheese bare? This was a poorly executed dish  Mushroom Vol Au Vent w. Jang Sauce was pretty good but very small portion for the price. Rock shrimp was okay,  nothing special, tasted like battered and fried shrimp a la general tsao chicken only with shrimp  Entrees  Bulgogi was good, polenta was an interesting combination. Over salted. Duck bimbinbap also good, but salty. Pork chop was definitely a bit undercooked a too pink in some areas. Aside from that the pork was juicy Kimchi salad side was good, considering that there was actually no pickled cabbage Final note, bathrooms are located in the hotel lobby and are poorly designed. You apparently need a card key to open the door and the card key I used did not work so I waited for bit before someone else cane along and used a functional key to open the door. One of the stalls also had no soap in the dispenser and the soap dispenser was also located over the toilet so that water could drip all over the seat. Poorly designed."
Yummy!!! Fried chicken & waffles are one of their dishes that they're known for and it sure lives up to the hype. The kale salad here is also really good and I don't even like kale but I finished the entire salad.  There is one thing I wouldn't get and that would be the skate fish. It was extremely salty... so salty that it tasted bitter. So stay away from that dish!
Amazing. I love the mushrooms and pancetta, and their olive oil cake is unique and scrumptious. All of their pastas are also deliciously al dente. They have a diverse drink menu and really friendly staff! I was recently waited on by an employee named Heather who was very kind and patient.
My friend and I came here on a saturday for some brunch and both of us left feeling underwhelmed and vowed not to return. Firstly my friend ordered off the brunch menu and wanted to get an iced tea instead of it being hot but the waitress told her she had to order the iced tea separate because the brunch only comes with hot tea (I mean really?). Then when I ordered I told the waitress I would pay the full price for the brunch but I just didnt want the eggs that came with the meal. The waitress said that I had to have the eggs with the meal and they COULD NOT remove the eggs, I would just have to do that myself afterwards. What kind of restaurant forcesyou to have food on your plate that you DONT want if they arent losing any money by removing it?! And the waitress charged extra for an orange juice that was included with the brunch.  I wouldnt reccomend going there AT ALL.
I rarely post bad reviews. And the stars im giving here are because the service was good. I go to a lot of NY restaurants. It's what I chose to spend my money on. I have no problem spending a lot of money for a great dinner. That being said... I ordered the entree half lobster. I figured since it was an entree portion it would be at least one half of a two lb lobster. Even that would be small, but ok. The menu price was $47 I think. (My dinner date and I both ordered it.) What came out was- and I'm being generous- one half of a 1 1/4 lb lobster. It was MAYBE three bites of lobster for almost $50. I was starving after dinner. I've never been hungry after an entree in my life. I was so disappointed and felt totally ripped off.
Table Reservation seating was on time. Lively ambiance. Slow to get orders. No napkins on table, servers not knowing ingredients, napkins still not given until asked for.  Drinks slow to arrive. Good variety drink menu including Araf as well.   Food display was good, but for service; left used empty plates on table even after entree came.  Food was almost traditional with some Mediterranean/Greek options.  Quality was simply okay and less than the level of restaurants in the heart of Paterson, NJ. Nothing that amazed. Overall good ambience, so so service, and so so food.  Staff felt overwhelmed and overworked.
Cecconi's dumbo is chic and delicious! They have a special happy hour special that occurs in the bar room from 4-7 daily. On the happy hour menu there are a variety of dishes such as pizza for 9 dollars, meatballs for 7 dollars and  a wide variety of beverages ranging from 4$ beers to 9$ negronis! The decor and ambiance is amazing with the backdrop set as the manhattan and Brooklyn bridges. This is a beautiful place to dine and watch the sunset.
Stop! Don't go to your local pizzeria! Or worse, don't order from Domino's, Pizza Hut or Papa John's! Get on the subway, jump in the car, hop on the bus and head over to Bushwick! Yes, Bushwick! Home of Roberta's! This is hands down the best pizza in Brooklyn! And oh yeah, hella lot of variety! You like your pizza spicy? How about sweet? You like it meaty? You sicko! Well Roberta's got you covered! Individual size pizza pies to satisfy the most fickle foodie! Great service with a lot of character and characters! And oh yeah, great desserts! Try the Sticky Bun!
Cooper's was one of my go-to bars when I lived in the area.  Why?  Beer menu.  They always had something worth trying on tap and even had Hill Farmstead stuff on somewhat regularly (at least as regularly as that gets).  This is the reason I would even pick them over better-valued happy hour spots.  Their happy hour otherwise is pretty lame; only a handful of lesser beers are discounted.  The place also looks great, the bartenders are very good, you can grab a seat at the bar or along the wall without a ton of trouble, and while the place is busy it was never too noisy.  Good whiskey selection too although I never took advantage. Main reason for 3 stars here is the sole food experience I've had here.  The poutine was a sad example of why you normally don't order this dish in NYC.  It sounds good enough: hand cut fries, cheddar curds, bacon oxtail gravy, and pickled chiles.  The fries were soggy under the gravy which unfortunately held little to no flavor.  The curds were plentiful but they didn't taste very fresh.  The whole thing needed salt or some other kind of spice desperately.  The pickled chilies were enjoyable though.  I struggled to come close to finishing it, only because I was starving and it was $12 down the drain otherwise.  Average it out and give this 4 stars for the bar, and 2 stars at best for the food.
Location: Momofuku has different types of its chain festraunts?! That's why this one is called Ssam Bar It's a open kitchen experience with a full bar at the front of the restaurant. Place is nice and can take sometime for you to get a seat if you are not here early enough.  We were there at the very beginning of the dinner time period and we were quickly moving to a table.  Inside, everything is limited with little space between each other.  food: got their Gua bao, as well the seafood soup? And the BBQ.  Everything is great.  I still remember how fresh the sea food dish was as well as the sauce inside that dish. Of course the duck gua bao is always a top hit at Ssam bar Service: very nice. I thought two small dish would not be satisfying my belly but the size is relatively good such that I felt but full when I finished all my dishes. Overall the service is nice.  Price: probably bit pricy.  Overall: good. One of the momofuku restaurant that people should visit
There was a 30 min wait on a Friday night! The service was great, our waiter was super nice. The food came out super quickly, like 3 mins after we ordered!!! The only downside is that you are seated super closely with other people cause it's a super small place. I did get the dry pork noodles, they were ok - I don't like sweet & sour but my boyfriend does and said the noodles were amazing. All in all a solid Thai place but nothing that blew my mind tbh.
I thought this place was just alright; perhaps a bit overpriced for what it is. I stopped in with two friends for dinner on a Saturday night prior to an event in the area. Our server was delightful and was very familiar with the beer menu, which was very helpful while we were making our selections. I settled on a pint of plum gose and was not disappointed. I was, however, disappointed with my Lobster Loves Bacon Mac and Cheese. There were maybe 3 pieces of lobster in the whole thing and the chunks of bacon were thick, unappetizing, and difficult to eat with the daintier shaped noodles. I ended up pushing most of the bacon to the side. For $25, I expected more lobster and better-prepared bacon. I would order something different next time or try a different restaurant in the area.
My boyfriend has been raving about this place for months now and was so happy that we were able to get reservations on Wednesday at 10pm. A group of friends were in town and we had to show them a great and delicious time so L'Artusi it was. I am so glad we came because the food here was amazing. Great quality, good portions, awesome service and beautiful décor/vibe from the restaurant. Everything was easily shared between 4 people. Crudo: Day Boat Scallops: The scallop were super fresh and the taste of the olive oil and lemon was overwhelming but in a great way. It complemented the raw scallops perfectly. Great texture and even better taste. Perfect to start the meal as it was so refreshing. Verdura: Roasted Mushrooms: There was a lot of talk on these mushrooms and I can see why. The mushrooms were roasted so well. Mixed with the fried egg and ricotta salata only elevated it even more. Plenty of flavor from the mushrooms.  Pasta: Orecchiette: Fresh, in-house made pasta is always amazing. Al-dente, a great chew to the bite. There was plenty of pasta, pecorino, sausage and salumi to go around. Tagliatelle: Just as amazing as the Orecchiette. Super flavorful from the Bolognese. If you like long, flat noodle, this is your dish. Pici: The rabbit ragu and olive flavors were definitely the star of the dish. Perfect with the pasta as the carrier of delicious flavor.  Overall the pastas were just great. All al-dente and plentiful in the dishes. I want to go back and try all the others. Charred Octopus: I think this may have been my least favorite as I have had better octopus in comparison. It was bit more chewy than I am used to and was at times difficult to cut. I will say that it was the end of the night so perhaps it was a rush job but still, it wasn't executed perfectly compared to the other dishes I had. Sides:  Crispy Potatoes - As the name would suggest, it was halved potatoes that were quite crispy on the edges. It came with whipped sour cream and onion which absolutely blew my mind. I can eat spoonful's of that on its own. Brussels Sprouts: Roasted perfectly with a great hint of lemon. Cauliflower: Also roasted perfectly, full of flavor. Dessert:  Olive Oil Cake - Super moist and not overly sweet. It had salt on the edges of the cake which enhanced the olive oil flavor. Delicious.
This is a very popular spot so expect to wait despite lots of seating. My favorite items on the menu: Pan Fried Seafood Ramen - flavorful and the restaurant does not skimp on the seafood Curry Braised Beef - heavier kind of curry with bold flavor
The food here is very good. But someone on the staff was very rude to my table. I was in group of seven and someone approached our table to quiet down...It was a loud Saturday night in the restaurant, and it's my opinion you shouldn't single out your guests and tell them to be quieter while they're enjoying your food. Unfortunately, I liked the food, but not enough to go back to a place that doesn't treat their guests politely.
Vegans beware: the jerk seitan is really really mediocre. It's oily and spongy and really terrible. We also ordered the festivals and they were okay but not exciting or remarkably delicious. If you're vegetarian or vegan, you should skip this place!
It's a cute little restaurant in Carroll gardens! The servers are very nice and attentive. The food is good, but wasn't out of this world. It's a little pricey considering it's not amazing, but the portion sizes are good. They're not too large but not too small. I had the lox for brunch and it came with a side salad- the salad was great! I would come back sometime. I don't understand why people wait in line for hours to eat here. They actually have a little crowd waiting outside on weekends before it even opens. Tip from a resident in the area: if you go before 1, there's no line. I walk by it all the time on weekend mornings and there's always empty seats. The moment 2pm rolls around, there's a crowd waiting.
Came here for dinner.  The atmosphere was really neat.  The space has this 1930's feel to it, kind of hipster-y.  The menu had a lot of pork options for entrees, and only a couple other types of meats/seafood.  The prices (I thought) were rather high for the quality and portion of the dishes that came out.  Not that the food was bad, but it wasn't anything super special.  Personally, I feel I could get a similar quality meal, with more food and lower price at another restaurant.
great spot for happy hour because it doesn't end till 10 am. the lychee martinis and white sangria is good. food is pretty good too.
OMG, an uptown Xi'an Famous Foods??? Good seating area, better than the one on 45th Street and less dirty than the one on Bayard. My only complaint is the lamb burger bread was not on point here. It should be more like a crisp wafer, but here it was just greasy and a bit stale. Meat inside was great though. If you're tired of the cold noodle salad, get the Dan Dan Noodles! I'd say the noodles cut in this style are even BETTER!
I write this review with a heavy heart. I have visited this spot before and I had a wonderful time. Currently I have been sitting in this restaurant for over 15 minutes and no one has even acknowledged me or my husband, we weren't even offered menus. The staff is deliberately avoiding our area and all eye contact. Someone literally just walked over and said hello and offered menus. We have our coats on it's obvious that ship has sailed. No apology, total  indifference. I would not recommend.
Calle Ocho has a special place in my heart as one of the first places I've gone to for brunch when I moved to the city. The food is delicious even for vegetarians, and the bread basket is amazing with the cheese breads. Also what a great sangria selection and deal they have. I've always had a good time here with friends in addition to good meals.
I know this place is most well known for brunch, and I've only been once due to the extreme wait times, but this is a review of dinner. We came on a Thursday night around 630 and there was no wait for a table. The service was attentive and prompt. They have a well balanced dinner menu with savory, hearty and healthy options. We tried their ricotta gnocchi with truffle which apparently won awards on the food network and was actually very good, along with the kale salad and Brussels sprouts. Only complaint is that the sprouts were very oily and salty but overall it was a great, efficient dinner.
One things that wows me about place is the diversity of the menu. Bushwick's Living Room is a small place, much like many of the local restaurants are, yet it offers a huge selection of menu options by comparison. And, you can have breakfast all day. I've walked by this place so many times, yet never seemed to make it inside. Yesterday, I took the plunge. They had a special going for $5 margaritas and sangrias for Cinco de Mayo. I wasn't super hungry, since I had already been eating all day, but figured I'd grab a drink on the way home. I snagged a seat at the bar and got myself a sangria (made with tequila, according to the bartender). Sangria wasnt terrible, but wasn't good either. I suspect they wanted to use well tequila because its cheaper than wine and they can feed that to unsuspecting young hipsters who don't know what sangria is supposed to taste like. As I stared at the menu options, I realized how many trips back here it was going to take me to try everything on this menu that I wanted to. And... ordered the macaroni and cheese ($7). I figured that it's just an appetizer so the portion shouldn't be huge.  False. It came in this big 'ole bowl with crunchy, salty, crusty goodness on top of elbow noodles with fresh cheeses. It also didn't come in a side dish oval bowl like I was expecting. It was in a normal cereal-sized bowl, and could easily be a lunch meal. The restaurant had a strawberry rhubarb crisp special that I really really wanted to try, but I don't like wasting food. I love strawberry rhubarb, so hopefully they'll have it again on one of my *very necessary* trips back to try some of the other food items. My bar neighbor recommended the lemon poppy pancakes. Sigh, there is another trip back. I'll be back for the food, but skip the sangrias.
The way to get the best out of Momofuku Ssam is to go for one of their large group dining options - it's the only way to make a reservation and the food is amazing.  The Duck Ssam is one of the best dishes in the city!  It includes a whole rotisserie duck on a bed of rice, confit duck legs, chive pancakes, bibb lettuce, a series of sauces, and two seasonal sides of your choice.  The duck is juicy and tender, and don't skip the rice which has been soaking up the duck fat.  It is more than enough food for 6 people.  However, the main menu has great options too, the favorites being the Pork Belly Steamed Buns and Spicy Pork Sausage & Rice Cakes.  Hope to try the Bo Ssam one day!
It was ok, certainly not worth the money. Very little flavor although the portions were good size.  The atmosphere was really interesting but very very loud so don't expect a nice quiet dinner.
What a wonderful place!  Love the vibe here.  Super chill music and atmosphere.  The staff was very nice and the servers are gorgeous.   We were here for brunch on a Sunday afternoon.  I had the skillet pancake with a side of bacon and my husband had the grilled cheese with fries. The pancake was super yummy!!!  It came in a skillet (hence the name skillet pancake ) and was served with raspberry blueberry marmalade, syrup and whipped cream.  Omg.  Party in my mouth. I would come back for this.  My side of bacon was about six pieces!!!   My husbands grilled cheese was really cheesy and the fries were crispy.  My only complaint was that service was a little slow, but not horribly so.  I would definitely come back again.
Just had the pork taco and some onion rings. This place is a hidden gem out in the open. Please come here. The service is friendly and most importantly the food is amazing!!!!! See you soon breakroom
Surprisingly delicious food for a restaurant/dive bar that doesn't look like much. We ordered off the old menu of the owner's previous restaurant, which you'd be wise to do too. The menus are laminated sheets of paper, which tells you that this place is way casual. The curried chicken was definitely the best thing we ordered. It was super flavorful and spicy. Thank goodness it comes with a bowl of white rice! I'd also get the garlic chicken wings again as an appetizer, which come out piping hot and very tender. The garlic shrimp entree and fried calamari appetizer weren't as good. I tried a few bites of my friend's crispy fried rice, which was really interesting and tasty. I've never had fried rice like that before. The owner also came around and poured us all shots of Jameson. He was so fun and energetic, definitely adds to the experience of dining at Fishmarket!
Went for Father's Day and first was given a table that I did not want. When I requested another table...with plenty open, the hostess refused saying all the others were taken, yet no one was there or reserved. Then the food started to come out...well, almost everyone got there food at one time. They missed one order and then the paella came out and was supposed to have three eggs but only had two. By this time I was ready to leave. The service was poor--had a trainee with no one watching and the food was blaaaah! Maybe one should try the other locations, but i would steer clear of this location if you want to keep your sanity
I was here for Restaurant Week's menu which is surprisingly similar to the Valentine's Day menu. I will list in order of most love: Buttermilk Fried Chicken Cheddar Waffles & Savory Cabbage Slaw with Balsamic Maple syrup: I felt the crust was very salty( I was the only one of four who thought that)but that the accompaniments effectively complemented one another to make a very tasty dish., Mini Pecan Sundae: Just delicious!,  Cauliflower & Leek Soup was very good, and finally the Pan-Seared Cod ( Again very salty to my taste) but it looked so appealing and everyone loved it. Drinks were very good. All in all A-OK but I have only eaten here once I intend to give it a second chance.
This spot is obviously still working out the kinks. I was a big fan of their EV location and was pumped when they moved to bk. Seems like they need some of the leadership of their other stores to step in and raise the bar here. They're constantly running out of menu items, the wine & beer list is much different then what they have and their staff is a lil green and not educated on the menu (ingredients, allergies, etc)  Beware they close much earlier then they advertise too.  Step it up Westville!
Not too content with the food quality at this Brazilian restaurant. Ordered grilled octopus and it just did not have any flavor. My friend ordered skirt steak wasn't crazy about it either. Overall just dissappointed
Came here on labor day for brunch. There were seating   available outside, but since it was humid I rather stay in. The waitress took our order and it took forever for the food to come out. She said the kitchen was backed up, but it wasn't like all the tables were occupied.  I got myself the California benedict, because everyone on yelp seems to be getting that. Upon arrival the dish just look sad. I understand that getting a benedict is not a big dish, but at least give me some more home fries. By the way I thought the home fries had more flavor than the California benedict. The only thing I would say that is good about this place is the decor, and their toast with nutella which was delicious.
A reservation was made the day before at 7:30p. We were seated within a few minutes. While walking through the restaurant I was in shock by the decor and the size of the restaurant. This place is two floors filled with majestic decorations that would honestly convince me that I was in Thailand if I was under the influence or something. I tried the Kao Tang Na Tung and the Pad Se-ew. Both were good! Kao Tang Na Tung is minced shrimp and some other seasoning placed ontop of a rice cracker. I just followed what other yelpers recommended and I was surprised by how tasty it was. Pad se-ew tasted like any other pad se-ew. I definitely want to come back to try the other things on the menu. I suggest making reservations as I heard it gets pretty hectic during the dinner time. Definitely a great place for an intimate dinner, NOT a great place for children. It is also quite loud depending on where you sit.  Random thought: After ending the dinner with a discussion about really creepy movies, I went to the bathroom and it was so dim that it freaked me out. So uh.. I guess don't go to the bathroom right after conversations about scary topics lol.
I was disappointed in this restaurant. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The waffles were not crispy, nor was the chicken. The  food came out as if it was cooked and then nuked in a microwave. My husband ordered the breakfast sandwich that came with fries. I must say the fries were excellent; they were  the best thing we tasted.  Bloody Mary was decent ( really small though ) and the Hawaiian coffee was a nice way to warm up. Ambience is nice, beer list is decent, the food was mediocre- will not come here again.
The wine was delicious but the food was just ok. Super excited for a fusion but nothing stood out to me. The veggies were the best part. The steak in the steak wrap appetizer was too chewy it was hard to eat. The corn just had cheese on it and no spices or anything so it was bland.  Service was good, but we were the only people there on a Friday night for dinner. I'd probably come back for a wine tasting but not for food.
Made a reservation a week before for the July 4th weekend for 4 ppl. At the last minute, had to add an extra person and they were able to without hesitation.  When we arrived there, we saw the sunroof room to the side that was flooded with glorious sunlight. It was absolutely beautiful with a tree in there. Initially we were going to be seated there but the sun was unbearable so they were able to seat us inside the restaurant. I really liked how there was a live band playing music the entire time.  We decided to order the bottomless brunch only for $30 which was a great deal. You can order anything on their brunch menu so we pretty much did that. The tuna tar guac was our favorite so we ordered 4 plates of those. They're small serving sizes but perfect for a group of 4-5 ppl. We weren't fond of the scrambled eggs or asparagus but I liked the spaghetti, pork, french toast and fruit cup.  It was a bit confusing who to tell our order to because so many waiters came to our table to clear our plates so we basically just told any random waiter our orders. It was a bit difficult to flag them down though, which was frustrating. So I guess waiting to get someone's attention was the worst part.  You think you won't be full but 25 plates later, we were stuffed and extremely satisfied. 2 hours is definitely enough time to eat. Bottomless brunch is the way to go and I'm coming back here for sure. The owner is also very nice and even helped us take group photos!
Haven't been here since my friend and I first came when we were 16! We went back today for brunch & were super excited to see what's changed. Fortunately, there was the same selection of pre-entree sweet biscuits and...bottomless brunch! Free sangria!  We got the gallitos to share, which is really worth the portions and price. It comes with soft shell taco, avocado, pico de gallo, scrambled eggs, home fries. Really savory but the random mix of everything is not exactly the most superb brunch :( Would love to come again and get other things on the menu and perhaps dinner. But this was def. worth the nostalgia
The food was really good, the owner asked us to Yelp review him, but I noticed a B rating outside their window? I'll return when it's an A.
Had lunch hear and found 2!!!! Hairs in my food which made me nauseas!!!  When I called to get a refund she said she would and never did people make sure you check your food when you eat hear!! You might be surprised with hair!!!
I came here around 10:30 and had no wait. Wanted to try some good Thai place and this place had good ratings. The interior is absolutely amazing with a great vibe. We were seating on the second floor that has a great view of the group view. I got the pad Thai and it was amazing and flavorful.
The food there was alright, I got ceviche and two tacos and guacamole. IMO the ceviche is overpriced, $18 for 5 pieces of fish, two orders of tacos for 20$. Guacamole was pretty good. But overall, place looked nice but food def overpriced.
With a bunch of Italian spots in NY, we didn't know which restaurant to pick. We were led to L'Artusi through a recommendation and I'm glad we came here!! Their homemade pasta is terrific, the ambiance is very cozy and sleek, and the service is exceptional. We had a late reservation so I would suggest planning ahead if you want to come here. Even though there are 2 floors, this place gets packed! Our server was friendly and constantly checked on us to make sure we were good. For starters, we received a small complimentary appetizer, a basil pesto spread on top of sliced bread which was pretty good! It was a nice surprise to begin our dinner. We ordered the charred octopus and I really enjoyed it. The octopus was huge, tasted fresh and had the perfect consistency. The lemon made for a nice balance to the acidity of the octopus.  For our mains, we decided to share three pastas: orecchiette, ravioli and cavatelli. All of their pastas are fantastic standalone. They're all chewy, doughy and soft. I loved them!! My favorite was the orecchiette which came with sausage, salumi and pecorino. The ravioli was superb but I was pretty disappointed with the cavatelli. While the pasta was delicious, I didn't think the toppings in the dish went well with the pasta. Everything felt out of place and didn't really fuse with the cavatelli...no cohesion with the dish. For dessert, you HAVE to leave room for the olive oil cake. It's amazing!! It seems like it's a big hit and now I can see why. It has a delicate touch that just melts on your tongue...so good! I would definitely recommend L'Artusi to anyone looking for Italian in NY...just gotta make a reservation well in advance!
Very unsatisfied. Food price is more than tripled, it's very crowded almost like a cafeteria. save your money and go somewhere else.
Pros:  Lovely and attentive waitstaff, cute environment, and prompt seating for the four of us.  Not to mention one of the better Italian whites (reasonably priced at that) I've had in recent times (see photo). Cons:  Extremely loud (dinner session), quite dark lighting-wise (diners and waitstaff moved like ghosts in a candlelit haze), my di Manzo starter wasn't prepared rare, and was too salty for me since it was cured beef.   The worst performer of all was my ragu, which came highly recommended by our server: Completely opposite to our starters, the pappardelle entree was shockingly bland, with a light spoonful of meat ragu mixed in.  The pasta itself sat inside its entree ceramic as if it's been there since the Middle Ages--- I could barely fork loose a piece of pasta without lifting the entire bundle from its bowl, and breaking off pieces of the either, 1)over-cooked or 2)over-rested pappardelle strips in the process. Needless to say I wouldn't be returning for a full meal, but perhaps to sample more of the Italian whites from their repertoire.
The reputation is well deserved! Amazing soup dumplings, their skins filled with delicious liquid and meat ready to burst with flavor in your mouth...
My boyfriend and I came here after a trip to Bob's Furniture and before I went to work. He had been raving about it for some time, so I was pretty excited to finely try it. I've gotta say that I really enjoyed the old school clothing that decorated the high walls of Red Rooster's swanky space. The restaurant was really well designed, and I bet could put a smile on just about anyone's face. The service was also very friendly and helpful. They responded quickly to my boyfriend and I's requests, and were very professional when handling our complaints. Which leads me too the complaints... I ordered the mac n 'cheese and unfortunately had to send it back twice for the same issue; it was cold. I had suspicions about it when the first order arrived. It's served in a cast iron skillet, which normally means whatever is being served in it will come to the table still bubbling. My mac n' cheese came to the table looking lifeless. Lo and behold, the dish was barely warm. Our waiter was really understanding when I told him, and quickly replaced it with another, however that one was even colder than the first. Ooops! Embarrassing mistake. Thankfully the third was boiling hot and really quite tasty. I really loved that it was served with an arugula salad, which offered a nice fresh and slightly bitter break from the super savory and cheese macaroni.  Back to good stuff! My boyfriend ordered the yard bird, and the few bites I had of it were really delicious. The hot sauce and bechamel served with it were really great additions. I loved how the bechemal was made simplely and had a delicate taste of nutmeg. (A lady next to us ordered the same dish and said the bechamel tasted like vomit, and I think she just didn't understand the classic use of nutmeg in cream sauces). The hot sauce was GREAT. The base seemed to be roasted red pepper, which gave the sauce a sweet and smokey flavor. I could put that shit on anything. Hehe! Also, the chicken stayed crispy for a really long time. Even after 20 minutes of sitting, it was crispy on the outside and juicy inside. Very impressive. Overall, Red Rooster did provide my boyfriend and I with a tasty meal and a lovely space to enjoy it in. Their mac n' cheese mistake was a star killer, but honestly, when they finally got the dish hot, it was very good. I would return to the restaurant given an invitation.
Great place for an after work meetup. Very central, about 2 mn walk from 34 st Herald Square station, yet on a local street away from all the tourist activity. Very modern and hip decor but still casual decor. Place was buzzing and packed when we walked in on a weekday after 7pm.  Drinks.Free soju shot with Yelp check in. Sampled their Mak Colada, a pina colada version with Korean rice wine. Great taste, I considered it pretty light. Also tasted the Passion Rose sangria made with Rum, passion fruit and orange liqueur. Very refreshing. Lastly, we had the Red Apple Sangria (on the house). Very strong with the bourbon and apple cider. Food was served tapas style. Picks from the menu that we shared between 3 people -Calamari & Nuts. Very good. Crispy calamari paired well with roasted peanuts -Corn cheese. Not really a dish made for sharing. It was basically half of roasted corn on a cob on top of bechamel cream cheese with some corn chips provided. I did find it the sauce tasty.  Our waiter couldn't give extra chips for some reason -Tuna Mayo. 3 pieces of butter bruschetta topped with tuna mayo. -Sweet and spicy fried chicken. Half portion came with about 6 medium pieces. Nice crispy layer on top but a little too oily for my taste. Service was labile. Staff was very friendly but very rushed. It was hard at first to put in our orders. Things were being missed. They must have felt that it was an issue since we were granted a free round of drinks at the end.
Great good, nice atmosphere, outdoor sitting overlooking the bridge. Will definitely return
"I went here about a week ago. Ordered tamarind wings, cassava fries and a bake and pepper shrimp. Everything was so fresh, and tasty and spicy. I was shocked at how good it was from a ""Caribbean restaurant"" in the heart williamsburg. I was determined to go back. Please understand I live in brooklyn, i eat food in brooklyn and my family and friends are mainly from the caribbean so i know what this is supposed to taste like. I order the same thing again today minus the tamarind wings and I tried out their sorrel ice tea. To start I called ahead of time for a pick up. I requested it be ready by a certain time so I can pick it up when it is fresh. I call to add another order and the host notifies me that my order is 25 minutes early for pick up. ANYONE KNOWS IF YOU HAVE BAKE IT SHOULD BE FLUFFY AND LIGHTLY CRISP, NOT SOGGY BEING THAT IT HAS BEEN IN A DAMN BOX WITH GUACAMOLE ALONG WITH HOT FOOD THAT WILL NOT ALLOW THE BAKE TO HAVE THAT CRISPY TASTE TO IT.  Did I ask for it to be a half hour early, no I requested a specific time for a reason. The place had 2 people in there so I really didn't see what the rush was for to make my meal. On to the sorrel ice tea, please please please never get this watered down, tasteless, overpriced drink. Arnold Palmer's ice tea has more taste to it (and that says alot), you could hardly taste sorrel flavor and WAY TOO MUCH ice.  The bake and pepper shrimp, was not as flavorful as before either. I asked for extra arugula andthey give me the whole damn bag it came in. Jesus there's extra and then there is basically eating an arugula salad featuring bake and shrimp. Onto these soggy, sad, and overcooked cassava fries. I had such an amazing experience the first time I tried them and now I got this sack of mess. There is a difference between requesting cripsy and requesting overcooked. #FAIL What a waste of time and money $22.00 to be exact. Restaurant's should maintain consistency, I will not be coming back and highly disappointed and discouraged. I guess I should stick to Flatbush, East Flatbush, and Canarsie for mi yard food deh."
Simply amazing food and atmosphere. I was not happy with the CASH ONLY policy (alas, the four stars) especially when I just looked at the menu and I am all excited about ordering. But alas, they do have an ATM in the store and there is a fee on top of your banks fee (thank you PNC for the reimbursement!). When I entered Habana's, the first thing I did was place my phone on the floor and plugged it into a wall outlet. I then sat at the center bar at the entrance and perused the menu. I was definitely eyeing the Cuban, which was denoted by a star as being the best in the city. I wound up ordering the catfish sandwich, with lettuce, tomato, and chipotle mayo on a hero. I also got the ginger beer pineapple lemonade. This was a ridiculously refreshing drink and at more than $3.00 for a what seemed like a 14 ounce cup, it damn well should have been. And no refills? Pleeeeze! That's  ridiculous. An employee did let me know that I could plug my phone into the hidden outlets lining the underparts of the long table and I thanked him profusely for now I could actually use my phone while waiting on my food. So you pay the cashier/host, take your ticket and watch for your number to show on the LED screen. You then proceed to the patio make a right, and pick up your food from the tin corrugated tin cooking room that is set into the restaurant. That was pretty cool. You could eat outside as well. While it was drizzling and a bit chilly, it did not stop a few patrons from eating on the patio. My food took about 10 minutes to make. The catfish was very moist. I liked how the bread did not separate from the ingredients when I bit into it. It was crisp, well pressed, but not rock hard. This was an amazing sandwich. I actually was considering buying an extra side of the chipotle mayo, but the sandwich was perfectly made with every thing layered just right. If this place did not have a CASH ONLY policy, it would easily get 5 stars from me. This will definitely be my go to number one spot in Brooklyn due to its great food, ambiance and unpretentious crowd.
I could have sworn I had been here before sometime last year because everything seemed familiar when I met friends here last week-  The corny decor. Expensive drinks and the bartender who seemed confused about life in general.  Perhaps I am in a mood but I dont see myself coming back to this bar anytime soon.   If anything it seems more of a summer spot then winter.  Also the fact they serve food and have no real dining area creates an awkward environment for drinkers posted next to the people lame enough to think having their kids eating at what is mostly a bar is appropriate. No joke a girl who couldnt have been more than 10 was reading with a flashlight at one of the tables while her and her dad waited for their food.
I was skeptical and in a bad mood the first time I went to Fishmarket, and found my pasta not to my taste and left grumpy overall. However, I did try the sea bass that my boyfriend's mom ordered, and it was delicious. I decided not to rate Fishmarket until I had come back for a second try, since my boyfriend thought his fried rice was out of this world and was raving about it for hours. On Saturday, we came back - mostly because I wanted the dollar oysters available all weekend. The place was packed and we only secured seats at the bar, but received full service nonetheless. The oysters were a steal and I almost wished I ordered two dozen, but wanted to make room for the spicy shrimp noodle soup I had for the entree. It was also really good, and my boyfriend's pork belly meal looked great as well albeit a bit small. We finished with the shrimp puffs, which were awesome! I'm definitely coming back to try the eggplant puffs that Jeff the bartender recommended. Speaking of Jeff, he was extremely gregarious and was doing shots with everyone - on the house. This kind of draw can't be found at most bar-type places, and really makes Fishmarket's atmosphere distinct. As long as my boyfriend continues to live in Fidi, the more oysters I am planning to consume on the weekends here.
I've been meaning to come here for awhile and boy it did not disappoint. The establishment was smaller than expected but we came at the right time to secure seating. The staff was really nice and I couldn't help but be immersed in the decor.  I had the tempura fish, steak, and spicy pork tacos. They were amazing! They were packed with yummy goodness. I'm counting the days until I return so I can try everything on the menu.
In NY for business and picked this place to take a client to lunch.  Is in an area of town where there seems to be a lot of tourists and run down places to eat - a little West of better hotels and higher priced options.   The food did not disappoint. My lamb burger was tasty and juicy.  So good I went there for dinner, on another day, and the Caesar salad w/ shrimp was excellent. Good cocktails too but less of a value than the food.  I will be back. Service during a somewhat slow lunch was a little absent.
Came here with a friend at 6pm on Wednesday for happy hour, only to be told that we just missed happy hour bc it ended at 6 :'( Nonetheless, I had been flipping through the Barn Joo menu all day so we stuck around to order some drinks and snacks.  We ordered a bottle of Lychee Soju, a Fried Tiger Roll, and the Crunchy Tofu to share - everything was delicious. They were also serving free soju cocktail shots which were pretty sweet. I really hope to come back to try some of the happy hour specials!! Protip (from our waiter, who made sure to point this out to us as he served our drinks): If you want to get drunk really quickly, eat the lychees at the bottom of the drink as they have soaked up a lot of liquor.
No Rice, No Business. The product is decent. Quick lunch of the same vein as Chipotle, Dos Toros, etc. However, there are inexcusable demand management issues at this location. First, there have been numerous times that I've had to shout, quite literally, over the counter for the person to hear/understand the ingredient I want. This place is no busier than Chipotle, etc, and this problem exists nowhere else. I shouldn't have to shout 'Mixed Greens' at you 5 times only to have you put something completely different on. Second, you should always ask for the receipt, and look over the charge to make sure you were not overcharged for a component of your dish incorrectly. This has happened to me numerous times, and is inexcusable. Third (and the real kicker in all of this), is their inability to carry even their most basic ingredients during peak lunch hours. At a place where rice plates are indisputably their most popular dish, it is outrageous that on numerous occasions, have had no rice prepared, often for over 20 minutes. Rice is the lifeblood of this restaurant's cuisine, and this lack of preparation is, again, inexcusable...but also incredibly audacious, given that you can hock a loogie and hit 5 other comparable restaurants in the area.  I want to clearly state that the product (when you get what you order, at the right price, with the right ingredients) is very tasty (and would likely have warranted a 3-4 star review), but the above behavior in unacceptable and deserves to be called out. I won't be returning.
My fiancé and I came here for drinks and tapas and loved it! We had the shishito peppers and steak and toast apps to share. We loved them both, but even better was the two together! The steak and toast is amazing on its own, the perfect blend of flavors. Personally, I love the peppers but I'd get bored of eating them on their own. To drink I had the kiss kiss bang bang, which was really good! You can tell the bartender is good when it tastes good and gets you a buzz ;)
"I had dinner at the restaurant Upstate around the corner from this place with 4 friends. After finishing our meal, we called an Uber with 12 min wait. Prompted by the wait time for our Uber and the chilly march weather, we decided to pop into Eddy's for a quick tequila shot. We walked to the bar and requested 5 shots with a bartender which at best I can describe as a lookalike for the actor Donald Faison, yet with an irish accent. Just as he took our order, he bent down to grab glasses and he asked us, ""Shots for everyone? Can you girls afford that?"" For some context here, we were all a group of 30something women and we were not rude or loud. I was taken aback, but then spoke up and asked him to repeat himself and what he meant by that. I can tell he felt embarrassed because he immediately responded with, ""Oh, I wouldn't pay this much for shots myself"". He then admitted that his comment ""came out wrong"" but that wasn't ""what he meant"". We took our shots, paid our bill and tipped him more than he deserved. The purpose of my post is: don't come here if you want to be insulted."
This place is really cool! My wife and bro inlaw happened upon this place on our way to Flushing Meadows for the US Open. The food was very good and healthy. They have a great craft beer selection and cocktails. It's a hidden treasure!
Had to take away stars for the aweful service! They have never been known for amazing service but I have to say that the service today was just horrible. The restaurant was not busy. There were many staff members walking around and not one came to take our order. We had to stop someone to place our order (oh and we had our 3 year old with us). We also requested a soda beverage THREE times and when it finally came it was in a small glass FULL of ice. The drink was gone in 3 or 4 sips. We inquired about a refill and they said it would be an additional charge of $3. Additional charges are fine if served appropriately. Anyho, ordered second soda with very little ice. The waiter never came to us until the end. Never introduced himself nor asked if we needed anything. The bussers were great and the ones doing all of the work. They took our drink order, dinner order and dessert order.  Overall, food still tasty, gotta give them that. I will however, most likely go to the other locations due to lack of service and the soda thing. (The other locations will Give you an entire soda can.) Will return to this location if in area and for special occassions or with a crowd because this location has better decor and space. Oh and I have to add that again, place was still pretty slow and they didn't even wait for us to leave before placing silverwear and basically setting up the table for the next guests. Again... Very very quiet-no guests were waiting.  Service was pretty much a disgrace! We were still sitting at the table. Yes, we took care of the tab and were putting coats on but still...
OHHH MYYYY GOODNESSS!!!! This place is toooo legit! So after a very eventful and hot/humid time going to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, my cousin wanted too take me to get some bomb ass pizza at Juliana's. While we were waiting for her boyfriend to find a parking spot, we head to Luke's Lobster to split a Lobster Roll. So then it happened... I took my first bite and it was like love at first bite. The bread was delicious. They don't cheap you out on the Lobster. They actually use lobster through out the WHOLE sandwich. I was telling my cousin how tin Cali they call it a 'Lobster Roll' but it's only like 2 pieces of lobster and the rest is imitation crab. lol. And before I knew it, I killed it..... Totally forgetting that I was going to share with my cousin. LOL. SORRY CUZ! Service: Really friendly. They let us stick our head into the window because the AC was blasting nice cold air. :) Will I be back?? HELL YEAHHH!!! This place was so good! Like my friend Aimee A said, I WISH THIS PLACE WAS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA! But I will be back for sure... I miss new york already!!!
"If I could give 0 stars I would. Let's just start out with the nasty host that you're not even greeted by once you walk in. My family was anxious to eat here but to be told we couldn't because the kitchen closes at 4:00 PM but we arrived at 3:20 PM. Another business establishment that doesn't respect its customers don't support this business support ""our own""! P.S  the manager Bradley is a RACIST, be careful my people. Have a blessed day!"
"We were greeted at the door, with a""do you have a reservation ""? We said no, she looked around and said this is the only thing we have right now, a tiny table by the door, while there were still 4 tables empty the entire time we were there. Our waiter Brandon was nasty nasty !!! They took over an hour to bring out our appetizers!  To top it off they included a $14.00 tip in bill !!"
I came here for a date night with my boyfriend and everything we had here was absolutely delicious. We came on Sunday around 6:15pm would proved to be the perfect time because it wasn't too crowded yet and we were seated right away. We ended up sitting in the back patio area which had a great rustic vibe to it. During our meal when it got a little darker the service came around and lit candles which was a nice touch. We started off with the calamari grigliati, which was presented quite nicely on a bed of arugula. We also got two wine flights (served only before 7pm) which was awesome because you basically get to try 3 different wines for the price of one almost. I got the bubbly flight and my boyfriend got the old world white flight. The bubbly flight gave a nice selection and I would deff get it again the next time I go! For our main courses I got the gnocchi di ricotta, which was absolutely amazing. The sauce had just enough truffle in it to taste but not to overpower the dish I can see why its a favorite. My boyfriend got one of the specials that was listed which was a mushroom ravioli I believe. He really enjoyed his dish and of course I had to try some of it too!  The service here was attentive and quick we never waited long for anything we ordered and they were constantly coming around and filling up the water glasses. For everything we ordered (two wine flights, an appetizer, two entrée meals) the meal came to under $100 before the tip which i thought was very reasonable. This place is amazing and i cant wait till i come back here again!
Prettttty good. They had a lot of issues with substitutions or being out of certain items - and a little pricey - but the food was pretty dang tasty. Try the zucchini cakes.
"Here we go! This is hands down one of the most satisfying and luxurious meals I've had in years. Came in here with friends on the Fourth of July weekend for a feast. Which is kind of Ironic with it being a UK restaurant. Definitely a meal to hit the record books and one of the best I've had in months or years and I've been fairly spoiled I feel over the past few. First off, the menu is pretty simple but I think there are more options now than there used to be when they first opened. Yes, it's still strictly burgers, lobsters, fries, and salads and that's it. Everything is priced pretty much under $30-35, depending on what you get. But you can walk out of here having a full huge meal for $20, not including tax and tip. Burgers - There's the original, The London for $20. The specialties - The Beast (which I ordered) and is a mammoth sized amount of Pat Lafrieda succulent meat loaded on with cheese, truffle mayo, and fresh lobster. The Frenchman (Seriously tempted to get this sucker) - A burger covered with foie gras and cranberry jam. The BBQ Pork Burger - well, you can't just compare this to the other two. That's not fair at all. These were priced between $30-33 and of course come with fries and a side salad.  Then you have your choice of Lobster rolls - All priced at either $20 or $25. The Original, the Asian influenced 7 Samurai, the Southern influenced Lobster Po Boy, and the Mexican influenced Fiesta Rolls.  Last but certainly not least you can just order a whole dang lobster for either $20 or $28 if you get the original. I'm still not sure what the difference is on the two larger lobsters. But hey.  Our table went with the aforementioned Beast burger, the original lobster roll, and the original lobster. Everything was perfect from the hamburger's temperature, to the lobster, to the buttery rolls. The lobster tasted phenomenal without even pouring butter over it. Seriously. Though, that happened and so much butter was consumed this day I'm surprised I didn't die of a heart attack in my sleep.  The french fries are pretty good. The sauces are great. Let's not even talk about that side salad. Let's just get straight to the sauces. Pay extra for the truffle creme fraiche. You might freak out at first. You might start loudly and proudly exclaiming in the restaurant with a wild look in your eye ""I LOVE TRUFFLE BUTTER!"" But I just don't care. Stop judging me. Truffle butter has changed my life. There's no going back.  I loved everything of this experience. The cocktails were pretty decent. The Madison Park Punch was my personal favorite of the group. It packs a pretty good punch, its sweet, and its lite and refreshing for the summer and comes with a cute swizzle straw. Desert options are a little boring is the only complaint. Just a mocha type of mousse and then a strawberry cheesecake mousse jar. But honestly, who the hell cares about desert when you just consumed 85,000 calories worth of butter. Ended the evening with watching the lobsters in the tank having a pretty epic brawl. I'm such a fan of Burger and Lobster though and can't wait to come back. Thank you England for this and so many other things. You know what's up."
Won't even take an order on the phone, give me a break! Ridiculous policy and rude about it as well. Does management think everyone walks around with a computer to log on to 24/7? Phone is easy and mobile, that's why almost every restaurant takes orders that way. I was walking to get lunch and called for pickup, in the time it took to go through touch-tone prompts and be (rudely) told they won't take orders via phone they could have had the sandwich half done. If Crisp wants to turn off customers, that's their M.O., but I was not happy at all.
This place has great food, the only downside is that the bar closes early on Sundays or isn't open at all meaning you couldn't get a cocktail with your meal even though they put the full drink menu in front of you when you get seated. As for the food, wow, they have really interesting and flavorful dishes. There isn't a lot in the way of vegetarian options, but that is to be expected. The cheese wontons were a blessing from the gods and was delicious and chewy (as is almost everything fried, but this was especially good). I then got the shishito skewers which weren't as spicy as advertised, but were definitely flavorful. Finally, I got the vegetarian cold soba (Sansai Kinoko Soba) which was great. It had a little smokey flavor which isn't something I am super into. The service was just ok, the waiter insisted on listening to music the whole time and wouldn't fully hear everything and charged us for a dish I had cancelled. Overall, the food was good, I wish the service was better and the cocktail bar was open.
Worst service I've ever received in NYC -- waited 45 at a table to be told I was incorrectly seated and would not be receiving any service ... entire waitstaff had massive chips on their shoulders... LITERALLY GO ANYWHERE ELSE FOR A DRINK
Very strange experience at the Slide Bar-B-Q on a Sunday afternoon. We entered around 11:30 and sat down in a mostly empty restaurant. Next, a friendly waitress handed us our menus, and then proceeded to list all of the things that weren't available that day. About a dozen items in all, including some sides. It seemed very strange, but we were ok with ordering other items off of the menu.  Then we sat and waited...and waited...and waited. A group of firemen walked in and waited at the bar for 10 minutes. Nobody came to take their order, so they left.  Another couple got up and left after they were told how many items weren't available on the menu that day. We didn't see our waitress -- nor any other waitress or bartender -- for a full 15 minutes at one point. In all, 45 minutes elapsed since the time we placed our order. When our waitress re-appeared, we told her we were in a rush. She assured us the food was coming in 5 minutes. So we waited for 5 minutes, then told her that we really had to go. She told us the food was coming out. So we waited another 10 minutes. Still nothing.  Finally, we got up and left. We wasted nearly an hour of our time at the Slide that day, but we do laugh about it, so that's something!
I really like this place. I loved the dish that I had for brunch which was the Smoked Ugly. Essentially it was eggs Benedict with pulled pork and a side of potatoes and salad. The eggs were cooked to perfection and the pork was cooked and seasoned fantastic as well. The salad was fresh and crisp. It was just an overall great dish. I didn't feel heavy or stuffed after which was a good feeling. I also tasted the chicken and waffles which was good as well. The chicken is actually in strips with the same taste as fried chicken on the bone. The aioli sauce on the side was to die for. The ambiance is super chill. Ambience and atmosphere always says a lot and I believe is a direct reflection of management. There is definitely a good vibe here. Our waiter Andrew was very friendly and attentive. Overall it was a great experience and I definitely want to come back for those poached eggs! The tap selection looks pretty awesome too. The taps are built into the wall which make it look really clean and non traditional in a good way. I may have to come back during a more appropriate hour to try the beer!
The backyard seating is great for a summer dining. Came here with a friend and loved the sheep cheese, black truffle & honey bruschetta. Pappardelle al ragu was great - and I'll definitely be back for more!
On my recent trip to New York City, I had bookmarked Ippudo because I have heard of their well known ramen for many years now and I have been curious for what seems like an eternity. Located on W 51st Street, the location is convenient to walk to for those near Mid Town, or in my case, I decided to take an Uber there not once but twice during my visit to the Big Apple. Ippudo is located in what seems like a residential neighborhood. When you enter, there is a small bar on the left, and further back there is large bar seating in the middle, with a good amount of tables in the back left. So overall, this is a medium sized restaurant, which is good because there is likely a waiting list. Now on to the good stuff, I started off with the  Peach flavored Ikezo(sparkling sake), which was lightly carbonated and had a jelly like consistency to the drink. I know this sounds a bit odd, but trust me when I say if you like fruit sake, you should give this one try. I also had the Ippudo Wings, which were salty but not overly so and had a nice cabbage salad on the side. For my ramen choice, I choose the Karaka-Men(tonkotsu broth with an added spicy kick). The noodles were the very thin chewy style and it allowed it to capture the flavorful broth without being too heavy in your mouth. Note, the soft boiled egg is an additional $2. Overall, it was a great bowl of ramen but for $18(with egg), not exactly an everyday value.
Couldn't think of a better place for my 300th review! I had the pleasure of having dinner here last week after having this bookmarked for so long and I can't believe it took me so long to check this place out.  Three of us came in on a weekday night and it was packed in here! We had no reservations and let the hostess know that. She said she'll check on a table for us and let us know but we can wait at the bar, so we did. A drink and 10-15 mins go by and still no table. We kept seeing her walking back and forth but hadn't approached us yet. Then we saw a party of three who walked in after us almost get seated before us by another host! So I quickly intercepted and informed the host we were waiting for a table. He sat us right away!! So what exactly were we waiting for that WHOLE time? She didn't forget about us because we made eye contact with her several times.  Whatever, that was weird but the second we sat down that was totally redeemed by our waiter Tyler. He was amazing! He was super funny, down to earth, knew his menu and was prompt about everything we ordered and needed. His recommendations were on point.  I had the lobster, shrimp and grits and my goodness it was heavenly. Their drinks are pricey, but very good. The mac and cheese was the bomb, appetizer ribs were perfectly flavored and tender. I mean, no dish was disappointing. Ambiance was totally chill, everyone around you is just having great food and drinks and enjoying themselves.  I have to come back and try their brunch everyone raves about.
"Was really excited to try this place because of their ""better quality"" poke bowls and their instagram worthy dole whip ice cream. Everything is preset so you don't have to think about what toppings you want in your bowl. My boyfriend and I got the toro bowl, today's special which was a salmon bowl, a coke, and dole whip pineapple ice cream. Everything together cost about $60. Poke bowls - the bowls are pretty much half empty. It's also filled with rice way more than the fish itself. It is also not the freshest fish i've had so the price is VERY steep. I also didn't leave full, I was still hungry. Dole Whip - PINEAPPLE COSTS AN EXTRA 4 DOLLARS!!! I just opted for the ice cream in a bowl. It was nothing spectacular, I was expecting more.  Overall, I would not come back. The fish isn't the freshest. It is deff not worth the price."
I happened by chance to walk past Yaso Tangbao and decided to eat dinner here. And then I've returned every time I'm in the area around dinner time.  Prices are reasonable, but after eating the mapo tofu I ordered, I thought not the best deal in terms of value. It wasn't the best or worst mapo tofu I ever had, but it was still a little disappointing. I ended up adding a bit of vinegar and soy sauce to liven it up. I've also tried the meatballs over rice with eggs which was a good staple meal.  I highly recommend the soup dumplings (I got spicy pork) which were great for a no wait, non-specialty spot. Each one had a good amount of soup, tasted porky, and was just overall comforting and delicious to eat. Ask for the vinegar with the ginger slices, since they don't offer it on the self service counter anymore.  It's clean, with helpful staff, and they sell really cute shirts with an old-man-dumpling character. Also you can sometimes spy on the grandma's pleating up dumplings in the kitchen (adorable). The chairs are kind of clunky and uncomfortable, but there's plenty of space and hardly ever crowded during dinner, so it's not as bad as it could be.
I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this place sooner. I usually don't like to review places when I haven't gone more than once. My one food experience here was bland. The guac and salsa was bland; the salsa tasted like tomato sauce (see my sister, Louise M.'s review - we went together!) My steak tacos were bland, and for something between $16-18 (I can't remember), you get two measly little tacos! Also, it might just be me, but, listen to these weird string of events: the kitchen sent my sister's order wrong - sent out fish tacos instead of chicken tacos. The food came out quick and in such a hurry that they got her order wrong. Next, (white) patrons next to us (and seated after us) were offered that night's food and drink specials, while we were only offered drink specials. We were probably the only patrons of color in the restaurant at that moment, but it was clear that the waitress didn't put the same care and effort in serving us colored folk.  I won't be coming back here when there are plenty of other flavorful places to eat at.
"I made a reservation at this establishment. Arrived on time. Was rudely ""greeted"" by the hostess and was told that the reservation just came in even though I had made it over 2 hours ago. Waited at the bar for over a half hour and watched multiple groups being seated. Spoke to the hostess and she insisted that our table would be ready soon even though we were looking at an empty 4 top right in front of us. The food was great but will not be returning. Too many lovely restaurants in this area with much friendlier staff."
I normally would not voluntarily go there since there are so many better restaurants in Chinatown.  However, I had a friend from out of town visiting and he wanted to go so I agreed. This place is so overhyped and full of tourists.  Every night the line is insane outside and the line is managed by the rudest staff ever.  You ask them a question about the line and the wait and they totally dismiss you like you're invisible or you're speaking Jibberish to them. Once you do get a table the waiters inside are equally rude.  Before you're done eating they already want to clear your dishes and throw the bill at you.  It's definitely not a place you can take your time to chew your food. As for the food, the soup dumplings are indeed good with  nice thin skins and plenty of tasty soup and meat inside.  However, the rest of the food is mediocre at best and much more expensive than other restaurants in Chinatown.   Do yourself a favor and avoid this place.  Chinatown has lots of better eats and service even though Chinese restaurants are generally not known for their service.  Oh, and the nerve of the restaurant to automatically include a 15% tip on your final bill.  If it was up to me the service there deserves 1% tip.
Overall, the food was delicious; the chicken pad thai with the crab rangoons is a great Lunch Special combination to start your afternoon. My only complain was that the service was extremely slow; I ordered food to-go, but they got the order entirely wrong and even prepared it nearly an hour after the original 10-15 minute wait.
"I loved Turntable when they used to be on the second floor, BUT this was one of the worse experiences i have ever been to. First of all, when my girlfriend got there and ask ""How long is the wait?"", they said we can be seated when I arrived. I arrived a two minutes later and then the host said please wait at the side. After 10 minutes we just assumed we were at the end of the line. I don't mind waiting on a line, first come first serve but should have told me so i can weigh my options, i would have at least tried their second location to see if that location was busy. Second, the couple in front of us were given a free appetizer because of how long they waited.  Ten minutes passed and i complained about how long we waited but I didn't get the same treatment as that couple. I am sure we waited longer than them since we were there for 15 minutes after they got seated. I was seated after more than an hour of waiting. Third, when we finally got seated and ordered we were starving! We couldn't wait for our appetizer, we got the two twisters fries. Our twisters was given to the table NEXT to us, that didn't even ordered yet. I know because they still had their menu and were trying to flag people down, to order. We had to complain that our food was given to the WRONG table. The host said we will get that as a free appetizer since they made a mistake. Fourth, after all the food came and the twisters came out, we wanted to get the bill and get the hell out of there. Just an horrible exerience. The bill came out and everything was charged. I had to tell them that i'm suppose to get the appettizer for free since the host promised that. They confirmed and i got that taken off.  I paid for the bill and left. This ruined my night. NEVER going back to this location."
I came here with a party of 5 on a Sunday morning around 10:30 and they told me we had to wait an hour. So we hanged out around the area until they texted me. Unfortunately I only got to try the scramble eggs :( because all of my friends ordered the same thing. The mushroom, spinach, and goat cheese scramble was tasty and in my opinion it was a good portion of eggs. The scrambles came with a side salad (that was delicious), a hashbrown (delicious also) and two half peaces of a seeded whole wheat toast that was also good. I am definitely coming back to try the eggs Benedict and the pecan French Toast.
From the time I approached this establishment I knew something was up. My friend who's Birthday we were celebrating was standing close to the doorway. I was on the phone with her asking her if I could just walk in being that she had reservations and I was the last one to arrive. I proceeded to the door & the doorman/bouncer was very aggressive. He then asked me where I was going I told him my friend had reservations & he still made me get on line. The next bouncer/doorman was telling me to take off my headphones as if I was a child & he stamped my wrist before entering. This scenery of this place was very nice. It was a bit dark, but I guess that was the theme.  When we were seated we was placed directly In the middle of the restaurant, so this is where all the foot traffic was. Aside from that me sitting there my chair was tapped multiple times that night.  They did give out complimentary Moët in the restroom which I thought was cool. The food menu was blah. I ordered the BBQ fries and the lobster mac & cheese which was good. I had the O.D.B which was very strong. Lastly when I left here goes the same angry doorman/bouncer with his shenanigans. I was going to grab the door and he insisted on opening the door. As I walked out he said you're welcome and I ignored him. I feel like he was fucking with me on purpose, but I didn't want him to ruin my mood entirely. The only thing I regret was not getting his name so that I can make a complaint. Other than that the place was okay.
Ordered the original lobster it was delicious and plenty of food for my Mom and I to split.  The lemon butter is delicious.  The staff were beyond friendly and catered to our every need.  Thank you!
** 2.5 stars ** On quiet Henry Street near the Manhattan bridge is one of a few places in NYC where freshly made rice rolls are made on demand.  Sun Hing Lung is a market selling rice noodles, soy products, and dumplings.  Out of their small storefront window, they also do brisk business selling small Styrofoam containers of freshly made rice rolls.  There are no seats, most customers buying to go or to eating right outside. Rice rolls are a humble, Chinese breakfast item made from a liquid batter of rice flour, other starch flours, and water, poured and spread onto a flat heating surface, much like crepe preparation.  The batter sets quickly, forming a thin sheet that can be consumed simply rolled up and doused with one's choice of toppings and sauces, or rolled around heartier filings.  At their best, rice rolls are silky, slightly translucent creations with an incredible mouth feel, slightly sticky but separating smoothly. Great rice rolls elude NYC, prompting my folks to make pilgrimages to the Greater Toronto area for that, for as long as I remember.  After consuming divine ones prepared streetside in Hanoi recently (banh cuon), I decided to give Sun Hing Lung a try.  Here, the batter is poured onto rectangular flat pans and slipped into a rack inside a tabletop metal steamer.  When done, the thin sheet is scraped out, rolled up, then cut.  There is an option to incorporate cooked egg into the roll; if chosen, it will truly be made to order. Many filling variations are offered.  Besides classic dried shrimp and scallions, there's corn, beef, pork, vegetable, fish balls, roast pork, and Chinese sausage.  Then there are the squeeze bottles of sauces: soy, sweet soy, peanut, Sriracha.  Once the order is ready, open up the container and squeeze away.  The choice is yours but most people use at least 2 or more.  Rice rolls are very subtle in flavor (although the best have a gentle sweetness and fragrance).  Especially if the filling is not substantial, they are canvasses that need seasoning. Still, proper trappings and fresh preparation alone do not make a superior product.  The rolls are widely uneven in thickness; overly sticky, resulting in clumping; and rough in texture.  They have the characteristic tenderness of freshly made, but that is not enough compensation for other flaws. Sun Hing Lung's rice rolls are no game changers, reinforcing the lack of great rice rolls in this great food city.  Still, given their competition (or lack thereof) and very cheap prices, they'll satisfy a fresh rice rolls craving.  As for me, I'll wait until I go out of town.
Very busy restaurant, the staff is nice! We have 8 people for dinner tonight, and we order a lot of food. I was ordered my favorite tom yum Shrimp, pad Thai and papaya salad, order two were good, quite tasted like the one I ate in Thailand; but the Tom yum was too salty and sour to ate, that was a little disappointing about!
My experience has been pretty much same with Henry M's review. I was craving ramen when I was near Grand Central Station and Momosan was the closest ramen place. It tools less than 5 minutes to get to Momosan from Grand Central Station and the restaurant was super clean, welcoming, and hip. The server approached me right away and gave me enough time to think about my order. I ordered Peking duck taco ($5) and a small size tan tan ramen ($11) which is a spicy coconut curry ramen.  Peking duck taco was really good but I think it was a bit over priced. If it was just $1 cheaper, I think I would've been happier. As for the ramen, I rate restaurants mostly on the taste, and unfortunately the ramen was not as good as I expected. The ramen was too thick and salty for my taste. I think someone who enjoys salty chips with cheese dip might like this tan tan ramen but I personally didn't enjoy it.  I don't think I'll be coming back but I could see other people loving this place.
Cute little bar in Lower Manhattan, albeit a little narrow and cramped. Perfect for grabbing a couple of quick drinks after work. Bartenders are friendly and attentive, and the patrons are all having fun without anybody acting stupid. I didn't try the food, so I can't vouch for that. But if you're in the hood, this place is as good as any to knock back a beer and a shot on your way to wherever you're going next.
"Hmm, I think I just got punk'd, Korean style. Started with the Korean waiter coming to the table,after we had to hunt someone down, and going ""what do you want?"", we all basically started laughing as who could be this rude right away. Then we decided it was the schtick of the place and dealt with it.  Rest of the night was finding guys to refill beers and waters.  It was like we were working our own table. Having been in Japan many times and eaten Izakaya there, there was little resemblance in regards to the food. Very average but others might enjoyed if  they've never had the real thing. Hard to critique that.  Also warning, they put auto-tip (over 20%) on tables more then 5! So with average food, horrendous service I can sadly only give it 1 star. There just has to be better izakaya in this town with good Japanese style service.  Never again."
"Went in for the vegetable and mushroom soup dumplings. Was informed by the waiter that they do not serve them, even though they are on the menu.  To our great surprise, the waiter said ""They are not good anyway."" Then the waiter and cashier started discussing, right in front of us, why we were leaving. Oh boy."
Food was really good. Service was good too. Would come here again. I had the Mexican burger. Kid had the grilled cheese. Spouse had the turkey burger. We all left satisfied and full.
I have been here several times and love it. The food is cheap, delicious, and comes out quick, but the ambience makes it so that you forget how inexpensive it is. Service is also crazy good and responsive. They're quick, but only come to you at the right moments (when you close your menu, 2 minutes after you get your food, etc).  The last time I was there I got the red curry with crispy duck breast and it was so good. The sauce was perfect, creamy with a little kick, and the duck breast was awesome--fried with the skin on so it had all the fatty goodness.  The one gripe is that drinks are expensive for such a cheap place, but I know they have to make up the money somewhere.  Overall, if you want a reasonably priced dinner that doesn't feel like one, come here!
"I really want to give this place a good review based on other reviews but I can't. Myself and two others (all who are bartenders) came in for a drink around 5pm on a Monday. They ordered ciders and I ordered a Long Island ice tea. They said the ciders were really good. However, the bartender put bourbon in my drink. Bourbon does NOT go in a Long Island. On top of it, I do not like bourbon. At all. You could absolutely taste it. I mentioned it to the bartender and she matter-of-factly said ""some people like it in there."" Cool, not this person. She didn't offer to remake the drink or apologize. She just said that & walked away. I didn't even finish my drink. We were going to order food too but after that encounter/experience, we left."
This visit turned out to be a disappointment. Had high hopes after a beautifully prepared and delicious smoked salmon appetizer. Also, the coffee was wonderful and the server was gracious and attentive. After that it went down hill. Bread basket was less than expected and the cinnamon bun and pain au chocolate seemed to have been a day old. Did not meet my expectations from all the hype.
"My boyfriend and I had a reservation on Sunday night for dinner. The entire attitude of this boat, which I used to really enjoy as I've been here many times, was very different. Maybe it was the holiday weekend (July 4th), but the entire staff was borderline rude and unapologetic. From the moment we arrived and were greeted by unfriendly hosts, to our bizarre dinner service, the evening was frustrating. If it wasn't for the lovely sunset and view, we would have left early. Our waitress, Brielle (I believe), sent our main courses out before our oysters. When we asked if she had forgotten the oysters, she replied ""we only have 1 shucker right now and your entrees were ready"". Having spent years in high-end restaurants in the city waitressing, this was wrong in so many ways. Not only are the tables tiny so you wouldn't be able to fit an oyster dish with entree dishes, but that's not the way we ordered our dinner. Oysters are an appetizer, not a side, and not an entree, especially in this case. She never said ""sorry"" or apologized in any way. She acted like we were crazy for asking for our appetizer first. Finally, no customer should hear about the issues you have going on in BOH. She basically avoided us after that, and we had to ask for water several times. The portions are tiny, and the lobster roll no longer comes with fries - you have to order them for $9 (yes, that's just for fries). This was a really disappointing evening."
In reply I never said the waitress was stupid quite the contrary very nice and apologetics, from where I sat I saw her speak to a person who looked like a manager and a woman a hostess,my references were to your policy of no substitution and the fact that after l told of my disappointment and her conversation with at least two others no one said anything. Bottom line poor policy, poor training, or poor management. No need to Comp me but thanks best of luck I will chalk this up to a bad nite.
"My second time returning to PQ turned into an epic fail, leaving myself and my friend disappointed in our meals.  We came on a Saturday afternoon around 12pm.  We were able to be seated right away which was nice, since we did not have a reservation.  That's about the best part of this meal.  We both ordered omelettes - mine being the wild mushroom and hers being the veggie omelette (with assorted vegetables) along with 2 ice coffees and a side of bacon and 2 sides of avocado. Our server seemed uninterested in general - fine, we weren't looking for amazing service.  Our coffee was surprisingly good and V strong. Our omelettes came out and we both have never seen a stranger looking omelette.The coloring of it and the smooth exterior of the omelette was odd, it almost looked like the fake eggs you get at McDonalds.  Neither omelette tasted good - My friends ""veggie"" omelette (with assorted veggies) had literally like 2 vegetables in it. My omelette had mushrooms that came out of a can just thrown inside with un-melted cheese.  I will not be returning or recommending PQ anytime soon for brunch/any other meal - there are so many better options in the area."
"Went to dinner last night with my boyfriend and friend and we loved it! My boyfriend got the tofu and mushroom bibimbap and it was the best thing we ordered. I ordered the soy garlic chicken wings and they were good. I also ordered the garlic truffle fries which weren't too truffle-y or garlicky. My friend ordered the tiger roll and that was pretty delicious! He also got the shrimp tacos which he said was only ""okay"". Aside from the food, the atmosphere was great and so was our waiter! Will definitely be back."
"My boyfriend and I ordered from Falansai via  .  We received our meal pretty quickly, within 45 mins.  However, they forgot to include 1 of 2 orders.  I know it happens, but I wasn't really annoyed until I called the restaurant to ask about my food. The girl that picked up had no sense of customer service - very apathetic.  No explanation, no apology - just, ""Oh. Do you want us to send it to you when the delivery person returns, or do you want a refund.""  Of course I want my food, dammit, I'm hungry! But I was so annoyed I pretty much lost my appetite. Oh, the food.  It was okay - we ordered the string beans (which arrived on time) and eggplant (which arrived later).  My expectations weren't too high - if I wanted more authentic Vietnamese, I'd go to Elmhurst or Chinatown.  The delivery guy was also very nice - he gets the 2nd star.   Seems like it's a better experience in the actual restaurant, obviously these reviewers didn't have to deal with Miss Flat-Affect."
Very nice and cozy place to have a dinner with friends. Their duck confit was way too delicious to describe!
As a long time, devoted fan of Coppelia, I was eager to give Toloache 50 a try when posed with the challenge of finding a decent restaurant in this area of Midtown. While I recognized straight off the bat that the prices were meant for unsuspecting tourists, I was still down to shell out a LITTLE extra dough if the flavor and quality was right. Ultimately, the price tag is just not worth the experience. While the chilaquiles I ordered did taste authentic and flavorful, and the skirt steak was cooked nicely at medium rare, I also paid an insane $22 for them. If you break it down to the ingredients required to make Chilaquiles, there is just NO reason for them to cost this much. Maybe if the portion size was just a little bit more generous. The most expensive part of the dish was the 5 slices of skirt steak, so you basically pay $22 for 15 tortilla chips and some skirt steak. Crazy. You can find equally good chilaquiles in New York for half the price - so GO DO THAT. I also ordered a side of sweet plantains, which again, were decently executed, but overall nothing to write home about. I've had better, and the $9 price tag is totally absurd!! Plantains cost next to nothing and are not complicated to prepare. In summary, only go to Toloache if you are, like me, desperately in need of somewhere to go in this part of town and are low on options. Otherwise, save yourself a boat load of cash and go to one of the many other delicious Mexican restaurants in this city.
"Came for a quick lunch. Their wontons are as good as any I've had in Hong Kong, broth was very good with no msg. I also had a vegetable and a ""Cheung fun"" (dough), which was not bad.  Highly recommend if you want HK style wonton and egg noodles."
The food was delicious but the service HORRIBLE! I was brought the wrong order, and only then was my table asked if we wanted bread, as if they were doing us a favor. Then! Just as the food was delivered, we were told that our table was actually reserved and that we only had a limited time before we would be asked to vacate our table. To top it off, the waiter made a mistake and charged me $100 instead of $35 and made it like it was no big deal. Not only did the manager not offer to do anything to rectify the situation, I was charged twice for a total of $135. I think what the problem comes down to is extremely incompetent management. The restaurant was virtually empty, so we could have been seated anywhere so we wouldn't have had to get up. We also asked if we could eat outside since there were empty tables, but they refused to put two tables together to fit our party. I don't know how this place has lasted so long. I certainly won't be going back.
Great ambiance. Great Food. Great Live Music... Brunch is Awesome Sauce. The bar has a great selection of drinks. Try the Sick colada. Call ahead to RSVP.  Outside seating is heated so no worries. They may enforce a dress code so be trendy n chic...
I recently moved to Astoria and had to make it to Sugar Freak before they close 2/28! Went with a large group, and pretty much ordered everything on the menu... Round 1: gumbo,seafood gumbo, crawfish Mac and cheese, sweet corn and bacon Mac and cheese, sea food jambalaya. Round 1 was so good, we had to order a Round 2: Sugar Freak Po'Boy Special and cornbread. Powered through Round 3: dump cake and beignet with ice cream.  Everything was absolutely amazing. Going to be tough to see this Astoria staple go! Definitely planning a bottomless brunch before they close
Invited my nephew and his fiancee here to meet the fiancee and we ordered what everyone else orders. Food is good to great. Lollipops were probably the best. Fiancee ordered a mojito and it was super tasty. I got a flight of beers and this is my only complaint. The beers weren't that great. Just ok.
Awesome little restaurant with great food! I stop in here every time I am in Manhattan. Highly recommended!
Portions are huge! Prices are cheap! The hand pulled noodles are good! Will definitely be back to try other things on the menu!
So this my first bowl of ramen since my trip back from Japan and it was good, but it was more Japanese inspired than Japanese traditional. So first things first, my experience with ramen as a whole is that it's just OK, I had yet to find really good ramen joint until I went to Japan. Ramen in Japan, there is no other way to say it, is fucking amazing!!! NY ramen is missing the depth of flavor, it is missing the love and I want/need the love in my ramen! I know I am late on my review but I was gonna wait this sucker out, there was in no way in hell I was waiting 2+ hrs and change for ramen, ramen in Japan maybe. So the restaurant itself is rather small, it sits around 20ish so go early. I do want to make a return trip to try some other goodies.  The food: Clams- Chorizo, garlic, saffron aioli, lemon zest, butter with Mu dipping sauce. I thought the flavors were great, the dish was very thought out and the flavor profile really worked. The clams were very fresh but my only gripe were the pieces of sand in a few of the clams. The Mu dip oddly reminded me of a Thai dipping sauce and it had too much of a pronounced flavor, for me, I liked the clam without the dipping addition. Overall, a very nice stater.  Tonkotsu- Tonkotsu noodle soup topped with ton toro, kikurage, menma, and scallions with an order of nitamago. I thought the broth was great, it was a nice hearty broth that had a very nice essence of pork. But the issue for me was the type of noodle they use for this ramen, overall, I am not a fan of thin noodles of any kind or of any country. I am a fan of thicker and wider noodles, it's just a preference. My friend who ordered the Spicy Miso had thicker noodles, I will want to try that on my next trip. The pork was nice and fatty and melted in the mouth. The nitamago was the soft boiled egg and it should be added to every dish, soft boiled eggs are yum, runny yolks are yum. Overall, a very solid ramen choice.  Kuro Edamame- Black edamame, charred, yuzu salt, chili. I typically don't order this dish since it's basically a snack but my friend recommended it since she had it before and it was really good. It had a nice smoky flavor throughout and the yuzu salt is a nice salt for flavor but the yuzu was not really noticeable. Overall, I really enjoyed these but at $9 it's pricey for edamae. Mu Ramen- Oxtail and bone marrow based soup, corned beef, half sour pickles, menma, cabbage, plus nitamago. I usually like to go for the dish that the restaurant is named after and that was a great choice in this instance. I thought the broth was great, it was such a hearty broth that flavored the noodle nicely, the noodles had a wonderful chew and a really nice mouth feel. I really enjoyed the bowl of ramen but I did think the corned beef was salty. Overall, a ramen to try. 
I have been coming here for 6 years. truly disappointed. recently the quality has gone down. the guys that cook the Yakitori have changed. please bring back the quality. it's such a shame.  service went down as well.  what happened? did the popularity get to the owner/staff's head???  it's nyc, you are easily replaced
Beautiful and breathtaking decor! The colorful lanterns adds such an intimate and romantic ambience to our experience. I would not have guessed that Up Thai specializes in street food. I took two of my girlfriends for their birthday here. Killing two birds in one stone!  My girls and I walked-in for a weekday early dinner with no reservations. I would suggest walking in during early dinner hours or make reservations. We started with drinks: Mango Mojito, Phraya's Passion, and Yuzu Lemonade. All drinks were on point - sweet, crisp, and refreshing! Our appetizers include: Chive Dumplings, Summer Rolls, and the Pork Skewers. I really enjoyed our appetizer choices. Their rice flour wraps for both the dumplings and summer roll was soft and sticky like mochi. It was so good! Chive Dumplings are best eaten while it is still pipping hot. Summer Rolls were filled with shrimp, rice vermicelli, mint, carrot, and green leafy vegetables. Pork Skewers were perfectly spiced and charred. It was tender and chewy. I am into this street food!  Just the perfect place for a girls night or to impress a date!
The food here is solid and tasty, though the portions are definitely on the smaller side. The Trenette Al Pesto Trapanese (homemade trenette with almonds, garlic, tomatoes and basil) is a garlicky and hearty, while the Orecchiette Cime Di Rapa E Acciughe (orecchiette pasta with broccoli rabe, anchovies, bread crumbs, garlic and olive oil) is starchy and satisfying. However, skip the Malloreddus Al Sugo Di Cinghiale (homemade sardinian cavatelli with braised wild boar ragu) as it lacks flavor despite being full of meat. My issue isn't with the food, but with the restaurant's layout, specifically the furniture. We were seated at the most awkward slab of a table, our stiff wooden chairs too high and the tabletop too low, causing our thighs to press almost painfully against the bottom of the tabletop. After fidgeting uncomfortably in this torturous arrangement for about 15 min, I finally requested that they seat us somewhere else. We moved to a table where the chairs were again too high, though only on on side. My friends on the high side didn't want to go through the hassle of moving again, so we stayed put there, but I know they couldn't have enjoyed the experience.  If I could make a rec to Mercato: Invest in some better, more proportioned furniture. It's hard to feel romantic when you can't even move your legs.
"This is a cozy little place that looks quite upscale with amazing service, but good prices. This is the perfect place for ""ladies that do lunch"". The food is well presented and quite tasty. I wouldn't say the food is inventive at all, but it's definitely good if you live in the area or need a good place to eat after visiting Central Park, the Met or the Guggenheim.   Highlights: The little teabags in the interesting packages and the lunch bento box. The boxes are the perfect amount of food. Oh and give the desserts a try. (The bread pudding is delish!)"
I have been to the Las Vegas Scarpetta. My first time in the NY one. We are a party of two. The small parties are seated separately. It seems like the main dining room hosted larger parties. There was also outside seating. Now onto the food.. We had to check out the hype about the spaghetti.  It was good!  The texture was perfect. The sauce was simple. Tasted like a tomatoe butter sauce with strong basil flavor. I wasn't exactly mind blow because of the price of $24. However, I think it is a fair size. You won't be hungry afterwards. Get your Carbs on. It just so happens that it was also restaurant week. We ordered one RW week meal. I would say the RW menu is pretty good selection. It includes some of their most popular dishes, which included the spaghetti as an entre, polenta as an app and the panna cotta as dessert. We got the yellow tail (app) from the RW menu. We also ordered the short ribs for appetizer (not part of RW). It was excellent. We wanted to try the short-ribs bone marrow dish that were in many yelp reviews. Unfortunately it was not available. We ordered the duck and foi gra ravioli.  It was delicious. We loved the bread basket.  Overall, we had a good dining experience. The staff was very accommodating. The dishes came out pretty quickly. The temperature of the food was not compromised either.
Most unique meal I've had. The noodles with chopped sausage is s must! The salad has a great dressing that wakes up your taste buds big time. Staff is super friendly and guide you through the menu.  A touch on the pricy side, but well worth it.
I assumed this place would just have a dozen udon options, but the menu is very extensive and they also serve other non-udon dishes like sushi/sashimi and various apps. I think I spent 15 minutes oscillating between getting the duck or creamy uni udon - but everyone raves about the uni, so I ended up succumbing to self-imposed peer pressure.  Creamy uni udon comes (not pictured). Love the presentation in the huge bowls, and satisfyingly large soup spoons for optimal noodles-to-mouth experience. In another world, if I liked heavy & creamy broths, this would've been amazing. However, this was way too heavy for me...I could not stop eyeing my bf's cold udon with uni, scallops, and roe (pictured). He caught on, and generously gave me a couple bites of light yet flavorful goodness. The hot udon was thicker noodles, the cold was recommended the thinner kind. Both were al dente and had great consistency.  Salmon sashimi was interesting because some parts were seared and others were not, so it ended up being this lukewarm dish. The sprinkled fried garlic pieces were a nice touch, though. I have no doubt the other udons are amazing. Just a personal preference on the creaminess - will have to come back and go with my gut udon :-)
Love this place, especially the breakfast menu (get here before 1130am or it's over!) great place after a hangover night out on fri sat or sun. Place is literally packed, maybe call when you're on your way to make a last minute reservation. Venue is enormous, which is proof that it's a great venue because it still manages to pack out. Eggs potatoes and their own create takes on things, it's definitely traditional Americans cuisine + the mimosas if your coming for brunch to fight the hangover by keep drinking. Living in Murray Hill this place is a staple for Me. I'm all fairness, lunch menu is eh. But nevertheless, Highly recommended!
Came for brunch and sat in the garden. Was a nice ambiance to be 'outdoors' when it was 30 degrees out! I got the famous Eggs Benedict and agreed with past reviewers, the ricotta was over powering. The muffins/buns were also hard and too heavy. The salad it came with was nothing special. In fact they should've changed the type of lettuce because it didn't work well with this dish at all. My friend got the duck confit and we also agreed it was a little too heavy, and lacked significant flavor to draw me back in again.  The waiters/busboys were also impatient in clearing our table when there were multiple tables of two that were open for other patrons to sit at... it's a Sunday brunch. We wanted to just enjoy conversation and a good meal and we got neither.  Would not recommend.
Food and drinks were good. As many people noted, it is very loud but has a lot of energy.
Despite the sauce on my dish being delicious, I ordered it with no meat it came loaded with meat (it was tasty but not in the mood for meat that night, ate around it, it was fine) the rest of my table ordered the chicken plates. The chicken seemed a bit undercooked and no real texture. Seemed like it was boiled instead. They did say the vegetables were delicious though. I ordered the rigatoni a la Vodka or something like that. Again sauce was on point! Depending on how I feel I may go back again and try something different. The artichoke appetizer was a little too bready.
Beautiful view to go along with amazing seafood!! I had the Trio rolls which was shrimp - lobster - crab. All 3 were outstanding and different from any lobster roll I've had!! Deff will be coming back!!
Amazing tacos and cocktails with nice service in a modern / hip environs. Highly recommend:  - the house-made chorizo tacos, deliciously seasoned  - the batter-fried fish tacos (it was red snapper when I went) - the mojito (with ample mint leaves and a sugar cane stalk)  - the passion fruit margarita  On top of the flavorful tacos and masterfully concocted cocktails, the staff here is quite welcoming and accommodating. We came here with a relative visiting from abroad and had some trouble getting our large group to the restaurant on time, yet they were willing to seat us when the majority was present. Also, the owner came around to give us a round of high-end tequila shots at the end of dinner! That was a nice touch.
"What a shit show. Where do I even start... It's a Friday night bout mins to 11 and Yelp is doing a  free delivery promo until September something. So I decided, Oh what the heck let's oder out on a Friday night. It's payday, why not. Lol . Saw the reviews for Black Swan and I'm thinking this is gonna be a win. *rubs hands with vigor* Ordered the basic good ole fish n chips dinner. I was hungry but I didn't want to eat with my eyes. Nothing complicated. Left detailed notes for the delivery personal to ring my doorbell or call my land line at 1234..... since the number listed on my Eat24 account is no longer in service. Got a messaging saying the food will arrive 11:40. I'm like that's a just gestimation, I can make till then.  I'm talking and laughing with my sister as she's making fried plantain and my stomach is doing somersaults.  Looked at the clock it's 11:42 and began to wonder where's my food. Phone rang. Saved by the bell I thought. Picked up. Well what do you know. It's Black Swan (not the delivery guy) calling to let me know that my food on the front steps of my Brownstone.  **Pause....** *As you and I both pick our jaws up off the ground.  I'll wait. I'll even let us collect our thoughts as we read that again.* I was in such a shock that I quickly went into that pleasant autopilot human and told the guy it's cold and that it's alright and I even nervous laughed.  As soon as I hung up. Something snapped me back to reality like a lightening bolt. I called up the restaurant and the call weirdly kept getting dropped every time I'd say hello. This got so frustrating after the 3rd time. Finally my call went through, I literally jumped right in and asked who leaves someones food on the staircases and not ring a damn bell or give a damn call!!??? Whooooo!!? Then I said, ""oh this is the person you just spoke to 4 mins ago""...  The line got ""disconnected"" again and this tine I had it! I called again and asked for my full refund. Thor sure if this is the manager or not but the  person had the audacity to say the delivery guy will come back around take back the food and then I'll get my refund. I instantly thought that this restaurant is so petty and cheap for suggesting that and I made up my mind to never eat here again. I told the man yes, come back and get your cold food and give me back my money. (I know at this point I was hungry as ef but I was not gonna toyed with). Horrible Customer service down to the T! They got that on lock with my order. I was fuming. If I was on the other end, I would have said ma'am this is on us. Sorry, you can keep the food and we'll refund your money. It was just 16 bucks plus tax. But jeez.  5 mins after the phone rang. This time Black Swan got their shit together. I was told the driver will be coming around with a fresh fish n chips and I can swap out my order unless I still want my full refund. I was starving and I know it'll take me some time to cook my own food. Or eat only fried plantains for dinner. But I was being reasonable with my stomach and I said sure. Another 35 mins pass by and I had phone in hand ready to tell these people to cancel everything and give me my money back. (They are literally 4 mins away) Phone rang and it was the delivery guy. I ran downstairs with the quickness of Thor with the cold ass fish and probably soggy ass chips. Looked at the driver and he looked like a sad puppy. I wasn't having I said a quick thanks as he said sorry. And ran back upstairs to eat. It's now 12:45 and well what do you know. I couldn't even eat the food cause my stomach stayed empty for too long. The chips tasted like wasted time and the fish was crunchy and I'm sure it's probably a great dish. But this whole experience literally made me lose my appetite within all the madness and waiting and my fuming. Chucked the meal to the back of the fridge and summed this up as the worst delivery experience of my life and went to bed eating fried plantains which tasted like everything and more. Smh ‍:'("
I came here for dinner on a Saturday night, waited 30 mins and was seated by 7pm. The tables by the bar area had very little room in between and the other areas including upstairs were more spacious. There are 3 bathrooms downstairs and 3 upstairs. Reservations is highly recommended.  My date ordered the unlimited 3 daily pasta and I had the Pollo al Limone. The pasta was not good. They all lacked ingredients, flavor and sauce. It was very bland but the pasta itself was cooked nicely (al dente). My chicken dish was so disappointing. Chicken was rubbery and the spinach was very bland. The whole dish was sitting on this VERY sour lemon sauce. I'd recommend it you enjoy really sour food. I could not eat it at all. The only thing I actually ate was the bread and caesar salad.  The service here was a mess. Everyone had different jobs (bread guy, waiter, water guy, pasta guy etc) and it just did not work together. I waited forever to see the menu after being seated. We got our water, bread and olive oil way before the waiter showed up. After ordering, I waited forever for the food. My date got his food way before mine. The 3 pasta liquids were mixing together and the waiters practically created a noodle soup! it was unpleasant to eat. Overall my experience did not meet my expectations. I walked out feeling like this was a tourist trap. For 2 people who ordered just entrees the bill was $70. That's upsetting considering the fact that it wasn't even good. The unlimited pasta for $25 is not worth it. Spend that money at a different restaurant for higher quality food. I would not return.
I was very excited to try Izakaya Mew due to the rave reviews. I came on a Friday a few months ago but the wait at 6pm was already over an hour for two. We were already starving so we did not wait. Finally got our chance on a Wednesday before Billy Joel at MSG. No wait at 530pm but it filled up very fast. CG and I tried 5 dishes --  Tuna tartare -- pretty small portion but it was wonderfully fresh with the cleanest slices of avocado Dynamite roll -- delicious! I love specialty rolls but not the ones too over the top. This roll had avocado, tuna and crab. The sriracha, spicy mayo and eel sauce gave each bite a sweet, spicy kick.  Fried baby octopus -- super crisp. Thin batter. Could have been seasoned better..this was underwhelming.  Omu soba -- I love yakisoba and enjoyed this. Tons of pork and veggies throughout. I don't remember the type of sauce they used but it was sweet and addicting.  Squid and shishito peppers -- this was sauteed with mental, butter and soy sauce and sounded interesting but ended up being underwhelming too. I wasn't a fan of the combination of flavors going on.  Overall, not as amazing as I expected but I would be up for coming back to try some other staples(okonomiyaki! Takoyaki!) and more specialty rolls!
Very good casual Chinese restaurant they only accept cash and American Express,  but the food is well worth it everything was fresh and delicious and the service was friendly& fast I would definitely visit this place again if I was in the area
The decor is nice for drinks but dont order any of the food, white castles sliders were much better than their $9 sliders, so far Ive tried 8 out of there 18 some what dishes and I havent been satisfied with one yet, doubt I will ever order any food from here.
Came here last night for a late dinner and was greeted with a lively crowd. The host seated us pretty quickly and we were given water almost instantly. The lighting was dim but we were able to make out the menu and everything looked good. The service was lacking initially, it took 10 minutes to get a server to take our orders. We ordered the special guacamole of the day (contains lobster bits!), platano relleno, and taquitos de pescado baja. The special guacamole of the day was very good. There was large pieces of lobster, it pairs very well with the avocado. The platano relleno- they should've mentioned that the pork is spicy because I was not expecting that at all. The contrast from the sweet plantains was a nice break and I found that to be the more enjoyable part of the tapa. Lastly, the taquitos de pescado baja is a traditional fish taco. Coming in a set of three, there was nothing extraordinary. Just your typical fish taco with a large slice of avocado in each taco. The food is good, however a fair warning, if you come on a weekend night, it does get very loud. But there is a lively scene here if you're looking to grab a few drinks and relax (somewhat). There's also a few tables that have sangria, so it looks like this seems to be a popular spot to go to for your sangria needs. Will try that next time I'm here!
The hostess this morning was incredibly rude. She made us feel unwelcome and uncomfortable. The food was unremarkable. Though last time we were there the food and service was better. The ambiance and restaurant itself is nicely decorated, but the staff's attitude needs to be improved.
From the reviews and photos we have been wanting to eat here for quite a while.   Finally got the chance today and very disappointed as we wanted to find a new place that we could enjoy.   Here's the rundown:  very crowded lively crowd, nice location and nice looking restaurant mostly filled  20-40 year olds.  Friendly staff. Interesting menu.    Food: very salty, dried out potatoes and vegetables, heavy spiced ingredients, low quality chewy tasteless meats mostly relying on heavy spices and salt. Even the bread looked good but wasn't. Taste was meh minus at best.   We were hungry and could barely tolerate eating it.  Coffee and juice were fine though.   Basically tasted like a bad diner in a upscale setting.  Price was much higher than a bad diner though.  Really nice marketing and look to the place, nice awning out front.  Go figure...
Instagram ready food and atmosphere. As far as the food, it wasn't that great. And pricy.
They have some good lobster roll and good Maine sodas.  Gotta love the location of this joint.  It's Financial district.
Concept was cool and restaurant looked great. However, their food was overpriced for typical filipino food. Food was tasty but gave my girlfriend and I stomach aches later in the night. I could've went to a standard filipino cafe and paid half of what I ordered.
Outstanding in every way!  Great food, friendly efficient staff, and inexpensive for New York.  I'll look forward to returning soon.  Thanks Uva.
A little less than impressed. I've been hearing lots of good reviews for this so I finally decided to try it out. I ordered the Ponzu Salmon bowl in Large for $15.49, and honestly very disappointed at the size of it. The bowl itself was small, and the portions barely filled up 2/3 of the bowl. It was mostly just greens, with maybe like 10 cubes of salmon and some avocado and cucumber. I am a tiny girl and I normally never finish my orders but I finished the whole thing and still felt hungry. For the price paid, definitely not worth it. It also didn't come with any sauce on the side, so i did add my own soy sauce (the ponzu sauce itself wasn't flavorful enough for me). I really wanted to like this place but its just mediocre. For the price paid, I expect better quality, more filling and a better flavor profile. This would be something I'd eat but probably wouldn't come back for.
Fantastic lunch special! For $9, you get a choice of appetizer and a large entree!  Came here for lunch on thanksgiving day, surprisingly there were a lot of stores around this area that were open. I got the tom yum soup for starters and the Singapore laksa for entree. The Tom yum was good though I would pass on eating the chicken as it was so dry even though it was in soup. The laksa is a noodle soup with vermicelli noodles with shrimp and pork belly in a coconut curry soup. I wasn't a huge fan of the coconut flavored broth and the pork belly was again a bit dry and unflavorful. Overall, the dish was okay but it's not something I would order again. I also got the Thai iced tea which was good and didn't have the gritty taste of powdered tea.  Overall, the food is nothing spectacular but at that price point it's really hard to beat!
"Atera made it to the three michelin star group this year, and also won the best tasting menu.. but I'm not impressed. Atera is like that new kid on the block that is trying a little too hard to be ""hip"" and ""in"" when in reality it just makes the place feel a little too hipster for me. The restaurant was kind of difficult to find as it was located inside a doctors office type building?  It kind of seemed like it was trying to be a ""secret"" place.  When you enter you get taken up the elevator to this dim waiting room/bar area where it was set up in a way with just a few couches that it seemed like a place to go mingle with other couples or people.  Mind you all the other couples waiting around kept to themselves just like us.   It made me feel a little uncomfortable being kept in this tiny little room with all these people i didn't know.. and I was super relieved to be fetched by someone to take us up to another floor for dinner. Upon entering the actual dining room, i realized the layout was pretty cool with the kitchen being the main focal point of the room and the seats in the house are circling the kitchen in a bar stool type manner.  Cool yes, but also uncomfortable to be sitting on these stools for 3+ hours. As far as the food goes, the tasting menu was a major let down for me now that I've tried both Per Se's and Eleven Madison Park's tastings.  How did this win best tasting???  Yes, the selection is ""unique"" and ""different"" with quite a selection of unusual picks like monkfish liver, pigs blood crackers, duck heart ragu, and purple beets dipped in beeswax... but none of these items were in anyway palatable to me.  Out of the box, maybe but I don't see how these items justify a $300 price tag.   Now if you were looking for a place to impress a date, and you had $600+ to blow on you and your partner.. this might be an interesting place to take them.  The place felt exclusive, like you had to be in the know how to be there.  But if you want a delicious hearty meal, I wouldn't come here.  Especially if you happen to be a picky eater."
"Absolute HORRIBLE treatment by lunchtime ""manager"" Eidric  today. The bill came and it was wrong. Eidric spent forever trying to fix it ( he clearly didn't know how to use the register ) and came back with 3 different bills, all of which had been charged to my credit card.  When I asked for proof that a refund had been issued, he told me that was impossible and told me to NEVER COME BACK !  NO patron should ever be treated this way.  I have left an email for the company, but no one has gotten back to me. Shame on them for having such a horrible "" manager"""
It was five of us in our party. We were celebrating my sister's birthday. Considering how small the place is, we had to wait a while for a table but it was well worth the wait.  The food came very quickly and was so fresh and delish. All five of us cleaned our plates. Everyone else enjoyed the chicken and waffles while I devoured the fish. Will definitely go back and have the fish again! I must visit the other locations too. I gave it 4 stars only because it's so small and tight.
I have mixed feelings. The food and service are first class. The halibut I had tonight was wonderful.  However, I took out the sound meter on my iPhone to check out the noise level. When everyone was seated I got an average reading of 88 to 90 decibels. This is VERY LOUD. Why in a small restaurant with a tin ceiling do they insist on background music? Much as I enjoyed the food I am not likely to go back.
Very small place where you feel kinda squeezed in the whole time. The Moroccan tea was very good and tasted pretty authentic. The food was amazing but the portions were so small. I say try to make a reservation for a good seat and order more than you normally would (if you don't mind the price tag).
My friend and I came here to try the different margaritas. We had already eaten dinner so We each ordered 2 drinks and then were quickly given our check to leave. There were still empty seats without anyone else waiting for a table. But they seemed really unhappy that we didn't order any food.
Update: Second time eating at Cecconi's- Though  have been here at night a few times and it is a big scene akin to the Brooklyn equivalent of Red Rooster Harlem. Glitterati, literati, sexy people, urbanites and suburbanites.Good news food has fared way better, service is another story. AteL  Anchovies with potatoes- $4 on bar menu Brick chicken with salsa verde $26 Sitting at the bar the first time for 20 minutes without service- I walked out and then returned. Water arrived and 10 minutes later a waiter. You don't know if they are laid back on purpose, but later find out that they are not laid back on purpose, but muddled at best. No matter, being unhurried here adds to the sexiness of it all. I sat near the pizza oven and the pizzas look amazing, and the oven is fab. The anchovies arrived with what I thought were toast points. They were actually, hot crispy potato wedges- and together with the anchovies, off the charts. The brick chicken with cippolini and spicy salsa verde was also delicious. The Almandine bread still steals the bread show- though the grissini which I wasn't offered looked visually appealing.
This is the best pizza in the whole city. MAKE SURE you get old fashioned and add toppings- everything is amazing, both veggies and meat, so no wrong choice! Good beer deal- 6 for 35- and nice outside seating! This spot is not to be missed. *Important note- restrooms are downstairs, so may be difficult for those with mobility issues.
My family and I went on a Sunday afternoon just before 12 for a table of 3. The hostess said it would take about 30 minutes, but we were seated in maybe 10-15 minutes if that at all. Not much seating inside, but everyone was crowding in since it was a microwave outside.  If you love eggs benedict, then you're in luck because they have a few varieties and well... we all got a different one. There was a crab cake, oysters rockefeller and pork debris benedict. They were all delicious. The crab cake one was probably my favorite, but I don't see it on the menu anymore. The pork one could probably use a little more seasoning, but not bad by any means. One of my eggs was a little over done for an eggs benny, but it still was a little runny, so nothing to complain about (just nitpicking at this point).  The one thing my brother noted was that there isn't a drink+meal deal for brunch like many other places around the area, but there are drinks that you can order if you're in that kind of mood.  TLDR; No drink+meal deal, but food is delicious! Wait time for weekend brunch wasn't long either.
Food and service was terrific however be prepared to spend a wad. I made a reservation in advance for my family of 6 and we were seated promptly upon arrival. We ordered spaghetti and meatballs and chicken Marsala. The meatballs were packed full of flavor and our waiter was courteous and dished it all out for us. The mushrooms in the Marsala were little flavor bombs. I'm not a fan of mushrooms but I loved those mushrooms so that's saying something. The assortment of bread they gave us as we were seated was a unique addition and added some interesting flavors to our meal.
Overall, this place is a 4.5/5. The only reason it lost half a star was because I received some of my appetizers after my actual meal.  I got the roti cani and crispy pork intestines as appetizers. Roti cani was very crispy yet soft, complemented by a curry sauce. If you have any leftover curry sauce, mix it with any rice dish you have - BOMB! The crispy pork intestines was crispy on the outside and chewy for the rest. It came with a slightly sweet sauce (possibly hoisin sauce?). I didn't really like the scallions in the middle of it though. I would still order it again. I then ordered Hainese Chicken with rice and tom yum soup. There's nothing to criticize about the chicken. It was just a bang for the buck. The tom yum soup was definitely spicy lol so watch out. I ended the meal with Malaysian iced tea and a happy smile on my face :)  I have tried a lot of Malaysian places, none coming close to the this place in Boston. BUT... this place definitely matches up.  I'LL BE BACK (voice of Arnold Schwarzenegger).
I was visiting NYC for the weekend, and my friends from college and I had dinner at Thai Villa on a busy Friday night. The restaurant was packed and we had to wait a little bit despite our reservation, but it wasn't long before we were seated. When you walk into the restaurant, you instantly notice all the gold colors illuminating the entire space. Our group was seated in a large booth with a lot of gold decor and lighting. It was beautiful! We started out with a complimentary appetizer of watermelon with topped with minced fish crumble. Yes, it sounds weird I know - but it actually tasted pretty good! The sweet, juicy watermelon actually paired well with the salty, tangy fish! For our main courses, two of my friends had the green and red curry entrées, which were pretty spicy, but they enjoyed their meals. I ended up sharing a few dishes with a couple of my other friends: Kha Nom Boung Youen (mixed seafood in a crispy egg crepe), Kua Gai noodles, and Panang curry w/ crispy duck. All of the food was absolutely delicious!! My favorite had to be the Kha Nom Boung Youen - but they were all so good. The dishes were flavorful and unique.  Overall, my friends and I had a wonderful time at Thai Villa. The staff was super nice and welcoming, and I can't wait to come back!
Food is good, crowd is cool, drinks are great but 2 stars for those dirty ass bathrooms with puddles of urine everywhere, definitely should have someone cleaning them every 30 minutes. Disgusting and lazy, and also not happy i had to sit across my date and couldn't even do the footsy flirty thing i do since i would've dirtied her with my Pissy shoes, Thanks a lot Pee , I mean Sea!
"Gave this restaurant a try after a fairly high Yelp review from others. My family and our good friend's families decided to give this a try after our long day at Governor's Island. Kids were famished and we really could eat some decent food. First impression was great. Decor conjures an image of authentic Thai place, and so I thought that logic should extend to the food as well. I was super excited thinking we were in for a treat. The experience slowly went downhill after the appetizers took more then 15 minutes to show up. The chix satay showed up undercooked. Then the Tom Yum noodle was served but it was the most bland Tom Yum concoction I have ever tasted. Think I can slap together a better noodle soup (someone who rarely cooks here typing). I have to give them credit for the stir fried drunken noodles and their pad see ie. Then my friend showed me the ""forewarning"" on the menu and I was like... that must be the warning sign. If only I had known. Maybe its a different chef. But we are certainly taking our eating out budget elsewhere in the future...."
This place is so good! I've been here quite a few times when I visit NY. The service is good (not super friendly but that's ok because they're quick) and the food is DELICIOUS! They give tea with their orders as well. The veggie noodle soup, dumplings, and their noodle dishes are delicious! I recommend a visit.
I have come to Gotham West Market many many times for lunch and for dinner and I've always had a great impression of it. Their Ramen is fantastic and their sushi rolls are great. Today though, I went there for lunch and my friend had asked me to get him a salad with buttermilk chicken breast in it, which I did, and I got a chicken bowl from the mexican place. All of the food was given to me packaged and closed up because I had asked for it to go. My friend was eating his salad and lifted up a piece of lettuce to find what looked like a roach but with wings. And not a small one. He thought it was dead at first, but it started moving. 100% Alive. That is absolutely disgusting and can not be healthy in any way at all, and could maybe even get you sick.
I was super excited to try Vanessa's Dumplings since it's always on those best cheap eats kind of lists. I walked away extremely disappointed. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because it was so incredibly cheap - even though my experience was pretty bad I was only down 8, 9 bucks at the end of it. - It was dirty. I mean, I've eaten at cheap Chinatown restaurants, but this was pretty gross. Previous customers didn't clean up after themselves and no one who worked there cleaned up either, so I felt like I was eating in other people's trash. - The crowd was super touristy - it was 99% backpackers staying in hostels. It kind of reminded me of Nom Wah - clearly what once may have been a great restaurant is now just a tour bus stop.  - The food was VERY sub-par. Too greasy, not enough flavor, and the most offensive of all were the bland, mushy dumplings. I can't believe this place is known for its dumplings - my grandma would school this place on dumpling making. Too much carbs and not enough filling for the sandwich-type dishes. If you are looking for cheap Chinese food downtown, skip this place.
This place was amazing! I came here for a lunch reservation with a friend and was seated promptly. Sometimes when I step into places like this with a stiffer dining room feel, I sometimes feel like I've done something wrong already just by walking in. However, the wait staff  here is very warm and welcoming and make you feel right at home. My friend opted for the tasting menu and I chose the beef tartare for my first dish and for my second dish I had the pork loin and deckle. After we ordered the waiter informed  me that there might be courses where I don't have food and my friend did (due to the tasting menu). However this was totally not the case throughout lunch! they were nice enough to send out two amuse bouches, which I thought was a really nice touch. They sent out gazpacho and another dish which was like a melon shaved ice on top of a cherry tomato panna cotta. Onto the food! Beef tartare - this was my first time eating beef tartare but it was soooo delicious! None of the flavors overpowered each other and the texture was perfect. Pork loin and deckle - The pork loin was a little salty but the cut of meat was on point and cooked to perfection. This was the first time I had even heard of deckle which I actually thought was pork belly at first but is actually a cut of fattier brisket (please correct me if I'm getting this wrong). Normally I am not a fan of the texture of fat and gristlier foods but the deckle was definitely a gamechanger. I had a bite of my friend's halibut (so tender) and his duck breast (so juicy). His favorite he said though, was the escargot. Then for dessert he kinda split off from the tasting menu (which they allowed) and we ordered the cookie plate and the raspberry coconut milk cake with the apricot sorbet. The coconut milk cake was very unique and the apricot sorbet was suuuper delicious. The cookie plate was very fun as well. They also gave us chocolates, I don't know whats in the one with the red dot on top but it's certainly magical. 5 stars for the service and food, for sure.
The udon version of Wagamama without the variety & vision in the old Union Square Cafe space. It's amateur hour here. Decor- long, modern, sleek Computer seating system borders on ridiculous. Like Wagamama they keep you waiting at the front. It doesn't feel welcoming. More on that later. Food wise; this is the Rolls Royce of udon Housemade noodles make it a fine Winter concoction. Ate:Truffle creme w/ mushroom $17 Very fine udon, but upon leaving and seeing all the empty seats made me furious, when they sat me at the bar and had me wait for the stool.
The ambiance and service at this place was pretty good.  The food, on the other hand was quite awful. Even though my boyfriend and I had ordered the same thing, his food came out much later then my food did. His portion was also smaller. Everything tasted salty and bland.  I don't recommend this place.
I went to blue smoke years ago when they opened near park ave south and 28th st. The menu was great, told all of my friends and we all went and loved it They open one in battery park city, wow close to the other restaurants and the water front. I thought the other restaurants didn't stand a chance and then they took the fried bread and chipotle butter off the menu, WHAT are u crazy, then they took the smoked chipotle wings off the menu. So now i notice when i go to blue smoke, there's no waiting i walk right in, gee i wonder why. put the items back please. I now visit every couple of months maybe.
The food was great, but the waitress was very rude so it ruined the experience. Found 3 hairs in the food of 5 different plates. I think the three hairs should be enough explanation for the 2 stars.
Lobster roll has big and delicious chunk of lobsters while the crab one is just salty.... Lobster, always go with Lobster when in doubt ;)
"I went to the Greek on the recommendation of my daughter. We made a 7:30 reservation for 4. The waiter was courtesy, knowledgeable and engaging. The food was excellent. We run up a tab of over $400. No problem. We lingered for a bit after paying the check. A rude host, assistant manager came over and said ""We allow two hours for a table. We need this table for another reservation. Could you please leave?""  There are many ways this could have been handled better. The Manager denied that he would send an employee over to say this. I don't believe that for a minute. Very embarrassed for my party and the incompetence of the staff. Oh, by the way, all night long the Chef/Owner was filming a show for the Food Channel. Light up, lights down, music on, music off. Camera crew in the already crowded restaurant. Mood and ambience were terrible. Never again."
I usually bring my out of town family here since their hotel is nearby.   Their food is good and they have always prompt service.  Their prices are relatively fair too.   If you're in the theater area, this is def a place to check out!
Terrible. Just terrible. Got sat at the end of the bar where I was constantly being bumped into. There was a promotion on the table stating that I can get a free app for leaving a review. I asked the waiter how does it work, do I leave the review before I order or after and he gave me an aggressive answer as if he wanted to hurry up and go on about his day. RUDE. Food was OK. I should've stuck with Ktown. Would I come back? Nope.
This is the worst place I've ever been too in a long time! My reservations were for 10:15pm! I am still waiting to be seated at 10:53pm! This place is overcrowded and the customer service sucks! Been waiting on a table since I walked in!!!  Beware!!!! This place sucks!!!!!!!!!!! I will never be back again !! They are getting one star only bc of the ambiance and the decor!!!!!!! POOOOOOORRRR!!! UPDATE: I was finally seated at 11pm. I stepped away from the table to use the ladies room. By the time I came back, our food and drinks were on the table. Our waiter Craig was amazing ! He was funny and so sweet!  I ordered the shrimp pad Thai, shrimp tempura and a drink. Everything was great except for the pad Thai. In addition, the lighting was horrible. Literally had to use the flashlight on my phone to see the menu and food.  Unfortunately, my review is now a two star. It was unprofessional to have your customer wait almost an hour after making reservations a week prior.  Still won't be back.
"I'm confused by all these amazing reviews. I was really looking forward to trying this place after reading the reviews, hoping for a somewhat authentic Japanese izakaya establishment that's yummy. But gosh I was VERY disappointed and disgruntled walking out of there. Is it because it's on UWS so the standard for izakaya is lower, I mean SIGNIFICANTLY lower??  We came here around 5:30pm on a Saturday and were seated right away. We ordered a variety of yakitori: short rib with salt, chicken gizzard, beef tongue, chicken wings, pork belly with onions, mushroom, shishito peppers, and eggplant. We also got the udon and eel avocado hand roll. Hand roll came out first, eel tasted too mushy, rice had no flavor, but it was edible. Then the skewers came out. Honestly all meat skewers, except for the chicken wings, turned out to be very chewy. The worst was pork belly, it was like a piece of hardboard and I almost spit it out. Clearly they don't know how to cook their meat. Vegetable skewers were ok, but I felt like all of them were lacking some serious seasoning.  Here's the last straw that made this a one star review- the so called ""udon"", see picture. How could you call that ""udon"" when it's just rice noodle like what you'd have in a bowl of pho. Maybe they can only pull that to people who have never had udon?! But still, it's insulting to the whole Japanese cuisine, not to mention it was severely overcooked.  Anyways, here's the verdict: if you've never had Japanese food, any type of Japanese food, then maybe give it a try. If you are a snob when it comes to different types of Japanese cuisines/food, be warned, you may walk out of there feeling cheated."
Interesting place. The food is more authentic than you would think based on the ambiance. They are quite overpriced, and I usually don't like overpaying for authentic food.  That said, the atmosphere is quite nice and the food is very flavorful. I'd recommend this place for a date, but it is a bit costly to go to with friends.
I have been to Antonio's a few times and while the food is great they are inconsistent with service and dishes served. My favorite is their lasagna pizza, gnocchi and Nutella pizza for dessert. Their wine menu is limited and often white wines are not served chilled.  Service can range from fabulous to aloof.  It can get very loud and busy in the evenings especially Fridays and Saturdays!  Very hard to find street parking. Definitely a nice place to go when you want to load up on delicious carbs. I tend to go only when I'm in the area and usually during the afternoons when it is not loud and I can have a conversation while dining. I knocked off 2 stars due to the inconsistencies in service and food.
Popped in here for a quick drink after checking out MOMA PS1. Drinks were delicious, but my favorite thing was the bar itslef. It was open and bright, with lots of sunlight and exposed brick. Really cute place.
People come in waves and there seems to be a perpetual line for a sunday afternoon. It's more of a takeout place vs. dine in since there's very limited seating. Sandwiches are delicious! The bulgogi, original, pork belly, and 'bulgogi bomb mi' are all good. Some tips: Add the runny egg to everything. Get the loaded banh mi fries! grab a drink to wash it all down with.  note: a sandwich is cut in half. If you're not too hungry, ONE sandwich and fries would be enough for 2 people. If anything, throw in some wings and you're golden. awesome spot for a quick bite!
Sorry I can't give a higher rating. The Paloma cocktail was divine, but I came for the tagine, and I had nothing else to eat. The place looks good, very nice wait staff, and the customers are hip and friendly-chatty. But the chicken tagine was bland. I had to salt it. I was looking for complex spice and it didn't happen. The sauce was a bit watery, which made it hard for the couscous to be heard. Having said that, I did clean my plate and left full. I want to go back because I enjoyed being there--maybe I'll try the seafood next time...
There aren't many small semi-affordable restaurants in this very ritzy area but find another one. This place looks good but everything else is subpar.  Had the smoked trout salad and companion had steak. Both portions were minuscule and mediocre quality. Both entrees were sized as appetizers. The trout salad had 5 small shreds of trout (think sprinkles), an egg and frisée. Steak was also not a full portion - 4 small slices in total. Even the affogato was poorly prepared - a melon ball of ice cream, coffee and stale cookies hastily thrown to the side. Service was equally poor. Constant upselling. Server did not check on whether food was ok. It took forever to get his attention but he instantly appeared when the last sip off a cocktail or wine was sipped. He also has the audacity to bring wine to the table without a menu or asking what we even wanted. He simply showed up with wine without my asking. Be careful of expensive beverages showing up at your table and on your tab without notice.
Great place for wine tastings! My friends and I came here and it was great.  During happy hour it's $12 for three glasses to taste and you can mix and match all the options. They have a ton of choices!  My friends and I got some reds and some whites and they were very generous with the pour for a tasting. We also ordered their French fries which were amazing! They come with several sides of sauces too.  Great little place to come for tastings!
Second time back and we had the chef's special - was absolutely divine. 1,000 stars out of 5.
We ordered pho and Vietnamese sandwich, the noodle is not done, hard to chew and the sandwich is very small comparing to other places.
"Taco Dumbo is not your traditional taqueria as they put a twist on the popular food and focus more on the light, fresh and healthy aspect of tacos and also offer salad/rice bowls. People love those fresh, non-GMO, gluten-free labels. Unfortunately, it comes with a price tag and a sacrifice in quantity.   I ordered the salmon Nori Tacos (which are essentially unwrapped handrolls sitting on taco holders) and they were solid and super light but also very small.  I also got the chicken ""tinga"" and the maple chipotle tofu tacos which were nothing amazing.  I know I can eat more than the average person, but when I can easily chow down 4 slices of Grimaldi's after a $20 meal, something ain't right.  Maybe the tacos being gluten free had something to do with it? Despite the small portions, and mediocre taste, the restaurant makes up for it with its aesthetically pleasing interior.  The restaurant has a California/west coast/beach theme with its warm and bright decor which makes it very inviting and is actually hella cool...bro.  Grade A dank bathroom. Also, keep in mind, it's not a sit-down restaurant. You just order at the counter and pick up your food when they call your name.   One more IMPORTANT note. Not sure if this was only a temporary thing but they did NOT accept CASH which was quite odd.  I know many people use credit card now but where am I gonna spend my dollar bills now? This place has potential and has a great vibe but the food is average at best and the portions are small. Can we get some animal style tacos?"
Visit this Place thanks to high Reviews on Yelp. Nice Place with very attentive staff, they did a great job. The cocktail with a Lightning ice cub in, was really bad, tasted like an teenager cocktail of vodka and juice. We did 4 Courses and most of them was nothing special, meet was dry and the rest nothing speciel, just boring.
The food is great- we had the buffalo chicken meatballs for an appetizer, the traditional meatballs with tomato sauce and chicken meatballs with pesto sauce for our meals. Everything was delicious. We sat at the bar and the bartender was completely uninterested in us, she didn't ask if we wanted refills or if we needed anything during our meal. More drinks = higher bill, which generally means a better tip, so it was basically just laziness.  It's a shame because the food is awesome but the service ruined the experience for us.
No Bueno. Major disappointment.  Service is on the border of Sub-par/rude. I guess if you're looking to be mistreated and overpay then this place is great.  Be wary of the bartenders. They seem to think they invented the lemon wheel around here. The drinks are completely fine and the decor is nice, it's just everything else in this place that is terrible. My advice is go anywhere else.
I love Glasserie! I am lucky enough to live in Greenpoint so I can eat here anytime I want but it's definitely a destination for those outside of the 'hood.  The space is well designed but looks effortless and welcoming. The staff is knowledgable with the menu and always offer the perfect suggestion.  I have honestly never had anything that I didn't like. I am a vegetarian and there is plenty on the menu to fill me up.  I've also just sat at the bar for drinks with friends and their cocktails are interesting without being pretentious. The bartenders are always attentive and friendly even when they are slammed.  Do yourself a favor and go!
Very nice decor and they offer Korean style fried chicken which I love! It tastes great and great spot for friends hanging out to have a light meal or snack and grab a drink together! I would recommend to try all all the appetizers!
My favorite ny place I can spend on line 2 hours but I get my crawfish)))  Draft beer I recommend abita!!! It is outstanding.  Cash only!!! No reservation!!! Long line!!! But it is 5 stars
"Thanks for the response and explanation. Considering the fact that I was hung up on 2 times before even speaking to the manager, who abruptly hung up on me as well when my my response to his ""we are very busy, you know"" was ""well I'm happy for you"", I'm not sure in what version of reality you think i would call back a fourth time to speak with you or anyone else in your facility.  You used the platform of my review to highlight your product and defend your establishment (which, as a business owner I get) , but justifying every turn and shifting the blame isn't an honest approach to what happened in my experience with your staff.  I'm glad you have such a wonderful product and I wish you continued success, sincerely. However, no part of this experience or your response will inspire me to ever come and find out for myself what all the fuss is about."
Ari was an excellent server, and the lobster I had was terrific. Unfortunately, the filet was cooked well but had no flavor.
Went here solely based on yelp review. First thing is that, this would not be a place where you get reviewed this many (2700 something as of now).  The location is in east village. There is outside seating area.  Ordered a lot here, pho soup, spicy chicken wing, pork chop, pad thai and more.  Out of this, pad thai is the one that didn't meet my expectation, and pad thai is very standard food, so it's difficult to find a reason why. That's because the people here certainly know how to cook.  Once we ordered, the food came very quickly, so I was skeptical about the quality, but it actually tasted ok.  The thing is that this would be a place I wouldn't go if I didn't check out yelp and have 4 stars and this many reviews. But somehow it is, and I would not come here probably again.
I've been to ippudo a few times now and I was excited to eat here again. The pork belly buns are just as delicious as I remembered. They're soft sweet and the meat melts in your mouth. I would go here just to eat 3 orders of their buns if I could. That being said, their classic tonkotsu ramen is just okay imo. The broth is super salty and the chasu wasn't anything special either. I like bamboo shoots in thin shreds, but here you get large pieces that I didn't find appealing at all. The service is quick and friendly, but be prepared to hear constant yelling if you sit near the entrance as they greet every customer that comes in. It's fun, but gets annoying.
I was looking forward to Portuguese food,  sadly this place forgot to add flavor to their food. Every dish we had was flavorless,  took one bite of my food and couldn't continue. Extremely disappointed. However, the waiter went out of his way to correct the issue. Hopefully tonight was an off night for the kitchen.
I love the outside seating at this place, friendly bartenders and clean bar. A good time to check out this bar is in the summer. The place has prices that are similar to other bars around but it one of the nicer bars.
"I rarely take the time to write a Yelp review. That said, the customer service at Habana To Go was so awesome tonight that I could resist. I go to Habana Outpost often for margaritas and chips during their open season. I love their fish tacos - not greasy, lots of flavor, delicious! So, when I was down the street this evening getting my hair done I figured I'd walk down the block while my color set to grab some tacos.  First, the young woman at the counter was DELIGHTFUL. She was patient and kind, giving me time and guiding me when I couldn't make up my mind to save my life. She must have seen the disappointment on my face when I inquired about the veggie taco. I said, so what veggies go into that one? She said well, it's guacamole, lettuce and tomato. Again, she must have seen my ""oh that's it?"" face. Without skipping a beat, she said, we actually have a vegetable mix today that is sautéed, why don't I have them throw that together for you? And let me tell y'all, it was DELICIOUS. So, here I am, hair setting and my salon calls to tell me that I need to come back - I've clearly taken forever to make a decision. (Concerned that my hair would snap into pieces) I went to the counter to inquire about my order.  The manager has since come behind the counter and heard my cries for help. She insisted that I go and she deliver the tacos to the salon down the block. Seriously? Amazing. Note: it was really really cold tonight and she volunteered to go outside. Not only did she bring the tacos straight to my salon chair, but she brought me a free water bottle.  Habana staff, you made my night! Thanks for being so kind. It's the little things that keep the world smiling."
The decor of the space is very welcoming and cozy - with books and study lamps and a cute neon sign in the back, it feels like you're eating in someone's a charming library. I would give this place 4 stars but one time I went the food was so off I have to dock it to 3. The service is always attentive and friendly. The wait here can get long especially on the weekends, but their brunch special is underrated and I've never had to wait on a Sunday for it! The veggie platter they have is my favorite, all the steamed veg and potatoes and sides (poached egg over avo cream I think? Super yum) are very hearty.  The apps here for dinner I like more than the entrees. The cold topping tofu is delicious as well as the mung bean pancake. The corn and potato croquettes are creamy but good. The C4 jeongol we had one time was not warm, very sweet and barely had anything in it but spam and noodles. The broth was super dark and everyone at the table was left confused... The pork belly here is delicious but that one stew entree made me not want to try the other stews again. Hopefully it can be more consistent because I do like what's on their menu and for a different spin on Korean food this restaurant is a go-to suggestion.
Cocktails were great!  Very creative concoctions and so yummy. I had a dirty martini and a Kinky Boots and both were very well done. The ambience was cool and gastro pub sheek. The food was very good. Pork belly tostadas are outstanding!  We also had to pork sliders, mac n cheese, and buffalo chicken spring rolls. All were good but could have been just a notch better flavor wise to earn a 5. Overall if I could give 4.5 stars I would. Definitely recommend this place!
Stopped here for happy hour with a colleague with high expectations and an order of truffle fries in mind.  Mediocre at best for food and venue. Venue: (3/5) it's a casual bar for the after work crowd.  The crowd is professionals of all ages. Nothing special to note but not a dive bar.  Great for groups of friends, not dates. Good (2/5) - truffle fries were thick cut and still raw in the middle.  Would not order again. M With too many bars for the happy hour crowd, stone street is the better option.
Food is great so far. Service is too.  The music, however, is terrible and loud. Don't go here if you want speak with your table mates.
Solid 4 stars! I came here on a spontaneous dinner date with my boyfriend...which just happened to fall on Valentine's Day. Obviously, we didn't have a reservation and the place was a full house when we came in (around 5:30pm on a Tuesday night), so the host told us that all the tables are booked BUT we can get a table if we finish within an hour. We agreed to it right away (we both happen to be very fast eaters). The decor of the place is stunning - from the greenery, to the lamps, and even to the little candle vases. Decor absolutely is a major factor in the restaurant biz and this place really took that to heart! The food we tried was also yummy! The calamari was yummy and crispy, but the sauce was underwhelming and had too much mayo. For our entrees, I got the Pad Woonsen Poo (crab vermicelli), which was delicious! They were generous with the crab serving and overall, the flavors were all there. My boyfriend got the Kao Soy, which is egg noodle in this delicious red curry coconut broth. His dish was very aromatic, and I loved the broth - truthfully, I loved his entree way more than mine!  We also got dessert - not sure what's it's called but it was like this coconut pudding with coconut ice cream; I'm not a big coconut fan but this was not terrible! I wouldn't get it again though. Our total bill for 1 app, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert came out to about 50 bucks without tip - on par with standard dinner prices at Thai restaurants.
"Came here with my parents and friend from home, and had a horrible experience.  Food took forever When asked to bring over unagi sauce, for a roll we had already received our server took over 20 minutes, and on top of that the HOSTESS who was walking by got in my face and told me ""I'm sorry you're so unhappy"" When politely expressing my frustration for the fact that it took 20 minutes to receive sauce while our roll just sat there. Overall very disappointing experience, there are plenty of other options with MUCH better service."
It's interesting that they have a 'catch of the day' daily menu, ensuring the freshest of fish. However, the portion size is rather small and not very fulfilling. The remainder of their staple menu was also rather limited.  I probably should have listened to the other reviews, because the poké to red cabbage bedding ratio was absolutely NOT worth the price tag of $17. The crispy squid was very fresh, with a light batter, which was nice. Their crispy fish taco very good was also good, but also pretty pricey at about $7-8 per. On the drank menu, Hook, Line + Sinker was very delicious. Just A-OK in my books.
My review is solely based on the brunch menu. The service was good, but the food was mediocre at best. I ordered the French toast and it was a basic French toast. My sister ordered a dish called the southern fried chicken and that was terrible. The chicken was dry and so salty. My sister can usually eat all of her food even if it tastes bad but she stopped eating it after one bite. We told our waiter and he was nice and did not charge us for that dish even though we ate all of the mac and cheese part of the meal. My mom ordered a vegetable quiche special and there was nothing special about the quiche as well. It actually looked rather dry. I might go back to try the lunch or dinner menu but not so sure. I definitely won't be coming back here for brunch.
We have dining here for over 20 years and several times per year. This has always been our favorite place but don't think I would come ever come back again. Last week while we were having our coffee and dessert, the check already delivered to us and the waiter just wanted our table.  This week we came for lunch and sat in the back. Noticed that when people did not fiendish their bread, the waiter just chucked back to the big basket. Not coming back here again!!!
Really full but still wanted to try the pulled pork sandwich... tender and sauce made it better. Decent size too. Drinks are cheap. The place was a lot dinkier than I thought. Cool spot but a little shafty... Much better in the summer because it was kind of chilly outside that day.
Came here when I was in town a few years ago and have been looking forward to coming back ever since. The pizza is phenomenal. So glad I made it back today.
The meat and the fish were graciously grilled and the personel was very kind. I would rate it 4 stars but I don' think this is $$ restaurant. It is a $$$ and this was disappointing.
"I live right around the corner and my neighbors am I were excited to try the new place. It was a BAD decision to go here.       The entire staff is completely unorganized, if you're in a hurry DON'T come here. I repeat DO NOT dine here. We ordered drinks and guacamole first.The guacamole took an hour and 15 minutes to come out. Seems ridiculous but not a minute short of that! The only reason it finally came out was because I went back to the kitchen and told The manager. She apologized and gave two people at our table drinks. They give you these tiny tortillas to eat with the guac and after those were devoured it took another 20 minutes to get more chips to eat with the guac. Our food took another hour to come out...I went back again to the kitchen and said if our food didn't come out we were leaving. FINALLY our food came out.       The quality of the food wasn't bad despite the fact that my chicken taco had bones in it and we had to wait another ten minutes for silver wear. I told the manager abt the bone and she said ""I know we need someone to screen the meat."" What? The fish taco was good though.        Finally we came to pay our check. it came out to be $80.00 for four people and three hours later. By the time we finally got to leave the ice cream place on montague was closed. Total fail.       Looks like me and my friends will continue to make the trip to park slope for Mexican food and if I'm really craving it if much rather eat at chipotle than sit in that place for three hours. I think the manager should have came and apologized to our table or something before we left. It was a weird experience."
Earning their first Michelin Star, Casa Enrique is the latest Latin hype and I had to check it out. Old fashion reservations by phone, I arrived Sunday night excited to see how great this place was. Interior and decor was no different than any other inexpensive restaurant. After seated, you are presented with chips for the table- very much like the Chinese shrimp flavor chips. I ordered the Guacamole, Cow Tongue tacos, Fried Oysters, Mole De Piaxtla, and ended it with Flan. Overall, everything lacked flavor. Guacamole, I've had better at Rosa Mexicano and I was not feeling the sauce in the Mole De Piaxtla which was a mole sauce that consisted of raisins, almond, plantain, sesame seeds, dry pepper, and chocolate over chicken and rice.  What I did enjoy though was the Cow tongue tacos, but I had to add hot sauce to it and thankfully you can't go wrong with Flan. Overall, it was OK in my opinion but what really made them earn the 1 star? I would say it is their impeccable service. My plate was changed prior to each new dish and they are very efficient in getting everything out. Couple more things I was not expecting from a Michelin rated restaurant were the flickering ceiling lights throughout my meal and presenting my take out bag for leftovers before my meal ended. Very much excited for my other Michelin star meal later this week.
No alcohol served( need to bring own) extremely slow to get food( wasn't that good either) and service was non existent ...... no bueno
Their bottomless brunch during the weekend is one of my favorite things to experience. Unfortunately, it's very hard to get a reservation. They also have a chicken sandwich with manchego cheese. Delicious. I would do this 2-3 times a month if they had more availability.
Kiosuku at the 1st floor is suck, a woman who works there as a cashier is terrible, bad service. Obviously she is Japanese, i have never seen a Japanese female with such poor attitude. The launch boxes and snacks selling are nice, but  i will never visit again, just because her poor, terrible attitude.
Awesome bar, cheap booze and kick ass smoking area (complete with pond and bridge). Would 10/10 recommended to a friend!
Super hungry after visiting the Statue of Liberty and good ol Yelp lead me to Luke's near by. After the heat and it was nice to have lunch where it was air conditioned.  You walk in, look at the menu, order at the register and if you're dining in the food will be brought to you. I'm not gonna lie but when the food came out I was surprised at how small the portions were. But nonetheless it comes with a lot of filling! Whether it be the lobster, crab or shrimp. The bread was super buttery and perfect!!!! Soft and crisp. And the seafood was very good and fresh! You can have chips with your sandwiches as well.  Wish they had more menu options but they are very good! Quality over Quantity.
Food: I ordered the chicken pad-kee-mao which was good, but definitely not the best. I liked how I was able to choose the degree of spiciness. Portions were good, food was well seasoned. Also ordered the chicken pad-see-ew for the table which was excellent. Service was excellent and food came out quick. Decor: Great interior decor, definitely one of the top in the city given the food price-range. A solid date spot, crowded and bustling with no significant wait time.
The secret star of the show: the beef pepper noodle soup.  The broth is divine - best broth I've ever had - surrounded by long noodles and beef and peppers. After that, come the scallion pancakes. Don't know what makes these so good, but they are.  Didn't think their soup dumpling or veggie dumplings were that extraordinary. Would go back and just get the soup and pancakes. 5 stars!!!!!!
Needed to come out from the rain with about a half hour to kill before a mega event across the street at Blend. Arrived at half time with 2 perfect seats at the bar. Lee had a beer while I had the French Onion Gumbo, which was out of this world. A pleasure to catch up with bartender Greg and his welcoming smile. Eclectic, funky space with plenty of nicknacks and decorations from floor to ceiling. We look forward to returning again soon.
Tan tan men was delicious. When the hamachi Kama came, it was served with no Ponzu. When asked, they said it will cost $1. The ponzu was mixed with Soy Sauce which makes it thick and salty. I would rather they add the cost of that to price of dish which was already $12. Overall, service was mediocre.
YUM. This place gets a solid 5 stars!!  My party ordered:  -sisig -pork Jowl -khao soi -papaya salad  -octopus -coconut rice  -hainanese duck  -halo halo dessert  I LOVED the sisig and pork jowl. I combined these two with some coconut rice and the combo was divine. I was worried the sisig may be too salty (I'm notorious for disliking overly salty foods haha), but it was flavored JUST RIGHT! The pork jowl had bits of pork mixed in with the best brussel sprouts I've ever had in my life. Literally!! They tasted so fresh, and not drowned in oil or over cooked- it still tasted very much so healthy and fresh. These two dishes are a MUST.  The khao Soi was new and interesting to me (it is a  noodle dish). It was surprisingly spicier than the papaya salad, but it wasn't an overbearing spicy... it had just the right amount of kick to it.  Papaya salad- nothing too special. Party all enjoyed it but it didn't necessarily stand out to me.  Hainanese duck- to be honest, I don't think I can judge this fairly because it was the last dish that had arrived and I was stuffed! It comes with two sauces on the side for you to dip. Very large portion.  Halo halo dessert- just okay. Another Asian shaved ice with ube ice cream. We weren't as thrilled about this... probably because we had stuffed ourselves so much prior heheh  The restaurant got quite busy, so make sure you make reservations!! It can also get a bit noisy, so be mindful of who you're taking here and for what occasion. Very casual restaurant :)  I must also mention the mint cilantro drink. I only had a sip of it to try, but omgoodness!! I was so pleasantly surprised at the taste. The cilantro part was such an interesting ingredient to mix in, but it was perfect for the drink. Give it a try if you're feeling daring :)
We arrived at 11pm and despite the website saying they were open until midnight an INCREDIBLY rude manager/ member of the wait staff informed us they closing early because of the rain and then mocked me after I said we had paid a lot for an uber to travel there from Manhattan.  Don't know about the pizza but if this is any sign of their customer service... I wouldn't waste your time.  What a jerk!
Really fantastic and fresh seafood. We had the happy hour special (oysters + beer), clams, sea urchin + toast points, ceviche, main course of scallops and the mussels/fettuccine. No desert but they gave us a small dish of tasty pound cake which we enjoyed.  Oysters, clams- so fresh! The two apps- good and fun to try, but will be trying other things next time. Really enjoyed both entrees :). Satiating. Tasty, filling, hits the spot type of food. Love it and will be back :)
Established in 1905 and based on previous reviews we walked five blocks to eat at Lombardi's Pizza. Words can not express the disappointment in the food we ordered, but I will try. The crust is thin and chewy which I heard was New York style. But the sauce was deplorable. It was little more than tomato sauce spread paper thin and tasted sour. Mozzarella Cheese was rectangular and about four slices dotted the sauce. When you bit into the pizza the cheese slid across the thin sauce and pulled off in a blob, so we, and those next to us, folded the slice and ate it like a sandwich.  If this is Authentic Italian Pizza, then I do not want any more of it. Even though we were taken in by the media hype proclaiming it the best pizza in NYC, we were FAR from impressed. If I could have given it a zero, I would have scored it as such. I was so looking forward to this place after everyone raves about it! What a disappointment. Pitcher of beer and one pizza with 2 toppings - $60.
"NO, NO, and again NO going there again! Basically it's a little better quality food then a comfort diner's food for higher prices and lot's of false pretense. Starting from the hostess, who had more then 3/4 of the room available and still managed to seat us next to the restroom door; and finishing with the slow service and totally tasteless food, + gloomy, dark and unappealing ambiance (accept of course ""the volt doors"") it was a failure at every point.  Can NOT understand how this place received 4** on yelp."
My husband and I always stop by ippudo when we visit NYC. This time we brought friends over since they never tried Ippudo before. We have been eating all day and were near the restaurant, so why not go in to eat again. Once we sat down, we ordered two bowls of ramen to share (4 of us) since we planned to go eat somewhere afterward. Our waitress went from smiling face to shitty face the whole time once she found out we shared the foods. We were an easy and simple table, however, her attitude towards us and my party made me never want to come back again.
"Love this place! We stopped in because we saw a ""BAR"" sign on the street at 4:00, after being disappointed by the theater tickets line. We're in town from LA , and not knowing anything, stopped in. It's now 3 hours later; good drinks, good people-watching, and I will remember this place when I visit NY. Great service helped too!  The girls are pretty guys so you might want to check it out! Professional-type people."
"My sister celebrated her 40th birthday party here with a dinner party for 12. The night was wonderful, no thanks to our waiter. Our waiter, ""J"" started out to be very cordial but as the night went on he was a nuisance. He must have been sipping some gin & juice back in the kitchen because he became more and more unbearable as the night went on. He was very loud, drew attention to our table from other diners by screaming about how we were going to pay for the dinner, criticizing the our guests decision not to have alcohol and instead of switching my mother's appetizer (after finding out they only dressing they had was balsamic vinegrette. She's on a special diet), he brings her more and tells her, ""try it, you'll like it!"" What I disliked the most was when we were actually charged for them to cut and serve her b-day cake which ""we"" brought with us... per person!  Is this the norm? If so, you can have ""fine dining""! The decor was drab, the lighting was a little too low as we could barely see our menus and the place was very drafty, no surprise as this restaurant is on the water. I really don't want to play the ""R"" card, even though I had been warned about the restaurants along Emmons Avenue before when it came to ""certain patrons"". Nevertheless, I'm pretty sure this is my first and last time here. Its just not for me but to each his own. Upon our departure, I couldn't help but note the Roll N' Roaster directly next door and think there ,we would have had a much better time, had much better food and spent a lot less money."
Ordered 4 dishes, all were cold when served. Nothing special even if they were hot. Cheap drinks would be the only draw
Honestly, I used to enjoy coming here but one night, I encountered the owner who was beyond rude and honestly had a prejudice again my friend and I so I will no longer recommend this place to anyone.  He ignored my friend and I when we called him over to try to speak with him. We were not acting belligerent or out of character in any way shape or form (as some of you may be assuming).  I finally had to walk up to him and started speaking to him a low voice and tried to just ask him why he was ignoring us. He just dismissed us, told us he was eating and didn't want to fight and that he can speak to his customers however he likes.  Literally....so, if you decide to go, hopefully you don't have to encounter any nonsense from him.  But I do hope someone takes this review seriously and stops giving him business. ‍
Claims to be best mexican food in nyc. But its Not true mexican, the mole is like $25 the drinks $16, the guac and chips $11 it was expensive to say the least, I paid 18.00 for a combination platter with a beef taco and enchilada, the taco was greasy and fell apart and tasted like taco bell. When we went to pay we were informed they dont do seperate checks just separate payment, it came as a surprise and cause one of us to pay for all the meals the check for 4 people $123.00. On the way out of the restaurant the manager asked my name and confronted me on my review asked me If i would change it after telling me that the rent for the building is the reason the foods so expensive.  If the building is expensive then make the food better to compensate for the price. Some positives were good desserts and quick service. You could definetly find better more authentic for cheaper. I do not recommend this place.
"The food is still excellent, but had the worst experience today with a horrible hostess called ""Ming"" she was really incredibly rude. We had a reservation for 3 at 3:00 and she not only wouldn't seat us, but argued with us for nearly 10 minutes telling us how she wanted to kick us out. Right now there are countless empty tables which are completely available. Generally, it is considered polite to tell people that you're busy and there is a time limit AFTER you've seated them. I still recommend the restaurant, but this hostess is a horrible nightmare."
I took my husband here for his birthday because he wanted Mexican food and good margaritas. This place was recommended by a friend a while back. It actually has a similar vibe to his favorite Mexican place in the city, especially the garden space. So we were happy about that. They bring over the airy puffs immediately after they seat u. They don't have much of a taste, but is very similar to an Asian shrimp snack. A few minutes later a couple of Asian diners sat in the table next to us and said the same exact thing lol. It'd be more interesting if they did an in-house seasoning and put some on it, but it's complimentary so whatever.  For drinks we ordered the Casa Enrique and Grapefruit Margarita. Both were delish. I liked the regular better. I later ordered the Coco Mojo which was a mojito with coconut milk. It was amazing.  For apps we got guacamole and the crab tostada. Guac was solid but my husband insists that I make the best. Crab tostada was pretty disappointing. It tasted almost like a ceviche. I think they were trying to disguise the fact that the crab was borderline not fresh because it did taste a bit fishy, so there was an overwhelming amount of lime juice. Not to mention how tiny it was for 3 pcs @ $16. It was a two biter for more than $5/pc basically. Very little amount of crab. Wish I ordered something else.  For entrees my husband had the cochinito something which was the ribs dish. I tried a couple of pieces. It was pretty good and definitely cooked to perfection. I had the lamb shank dish which was popular amongst yelpers and my friend's recommendation. It was good and also cooked to perfection. It could've been flavored better because without the sauce, there was not much of a taste. Maybe this is just common in Mexican cuisine.  The service was good, but I felt the waitress came over way too much. It was practically every 5 minutes. Less chill and let people enjoy the food and convos without being interrupted woman!  Overall a pretty good experience if u want higher end Mexican than ur typical taco joint.
So after reading the many great reviews about celebrating a birthday here, I decided to give it a shot and make a reservation to celebrate mine here as well. I called a few days in advance to make a reservation for a party of 11 guests at 9 PM so we could enjoy tapas and drinks before going elsewhere in the city. The woman on the phone was very helpful and friendly and explained that she would have to check with her manager before reserving my spot which was understandable because I had a decently large party size. When she called back, she explained that there was a larger party reserved at 7 PM so my reservation would have to be at 10 PM to give them enough time to get them out and clean, etc. I figured that would be fine and agreed to the 10 PM reservation, so I had to go through the reservation process which is pretty strict about being late, cancelling, and all of that (you have to give them your credit card info before so they can charge you $15 per person if for some reason you cannot make it anymore). This was all fine since I really wanted to spend time at Havana with my friends after reading the great reviews. My entire party arrived at least 10 minutes prior to my reservation, so I told the individual (possibly the manager?) that we were all here and ready when the table was ready. He pretty much explained that the large party before my reservation was not even close to being finished somehow (three hours after their reservation?) and that if we wanted the table we'd have to wait longer. Since I already had plans to go elsewhere at a certain time, waiting for the table would have messed up the rest of my evening. So my entire party of 11 guests had to sit at the bar since I didn't know where else to go and I was getting pretty hungry. In the end, the manager gave us 2 pitchers of mojitos on the house which was nice, but I just found it really unprofessional that they made my reservation for a certain time and couldn't do anything else to accommodate me. I had been stressing out over planning my birthday and this only added to my stress. Half my party didn't even wind up eating because there wasn't enough space for people to sit at the bar. The food was good, but nothing to make up for everything else that night. Also, the bar tender then puts everyone on the same bill when we were all very clearly ordering separately... at a bar... since there was no table for us we obviously shouldn't have shared one bill? So paying was an absolute mess as well I have no idea what he was thinking. Anyway, I wanted to love this place, I was very excited prior to arriving, and was pretty disappointed by the whole situation. Maybe I'll return with a smaller crowd, but never again planning anything larger here.
"Horrible service and food was meh. This is where you'd take your relatives who are visiting and want to go to a restaurant by their hotel to take selfies with nice ""views"""
Same food, cheaper prices than the Midtown location. Soup dumplings are a must, I could eat these every day. I also enjoy the spicy green beans and salt and pepper friend crab. Underrated disk are the rice noodles with pork. Haven't seen this at other Chinese places ever, and it is an excellent dish. The rice noodles look like little wafers, very tasty.  No ambiance here, and you often share a table with strangers - FYI to those that it matters. Not to me, I want good food. This is the spot.
Absolutely loved this place! The food, the atmosphere, so wonderful. We came here to grab dinner before we went to check out the Botanical Gardens Thailand night exhibit, and I was very pleased with the service. I don't think I've ever had a better chicken Marsala than I had at the restaurant. It seemed like everyone was celebrating their birthday the day we went, and the manager (I think?) personally sang the happy birthday song to each and every one of them! Amazing. The restaurant is perfect for date night, as well as for family gatherings- we saw tons of kids there. I really can't rave about this place enough- the next time I'm in the neighborhood, I'll certainly go back!
Came here to grab something quick for dinner after searching for highly rated restaurants. Food is okay service is fine considering busy Friday night. But the medium cooked burger got me sick and I had stomachache 10 mins after I ate the burger. Probably won't come back anytime soon.
I came here on a lazy Sunday afternoon. It didn't blow my mind or anything. In fact, I found the food a little boring. The seafood dish that I got was rather salty and the buttermilk panna cotta had the consistency of jello. Kinda gross actually. Their signature cocktail, the old-fashioned, just tasted like straight whiskey. Not very pleased with the food here.
it's okay. i think the hype around it leads to expectations that are not realizable. The food was good, the setting/decor is just adorable, but something felt forced, or commercial. Wanted to love it. just meh.
This place has so much potential, but it was wasted on disinterested service and poor food. I just got home from one of the most disappointing restaurant experiences of my life.  SERVICE: Disinterested and disorganized at best. In the 2 hours we were there, we saw our server maybe 3 times and, when we did, felt that they could care less about the quality of the experience. Service was apologetic, but only after it was way too late (see below). BEVERAGES: They offer a good array of wines, beers, and craft cocktails; however, it took 20 minutes for us to get our cocktail, and when I got mine, it wasn't what I ordered. Getting the drink I actually ordered took another 20 minutes. When it arrived, it was good, but failed to make up for the bad overall experience. FOOD: It took over an hour from ordering to get our food. My date was served his food after an hour, and mine arrived after an hour and fifteen minutes. My date's short rib tacos were quite good; however, the $20 brisket I ordered was--to be frank--inedible. I was served a slab of 85% lard and 15% brisket, served alongside a side of what was supposed to be sauteed kale (served raw) and cold, dense cornbread. It was impossible to find the server to rectify the situation. Only after 30 minutes of sitting in front of an uneaten plate of food did anyone notice something wasn't quite right. When I confronted the server about the terrible food, they said they were in the process of hiring a new chef (after two weeks...?) because there had been a lot of problems with the quality of the food. I have never, in my life, sent back food or refused to pay for food. I did tonight, because I felt robbed--empty stomach, bad taste in my mouth, two hours of wasted time.  It will take a long time for me to consider returning to Queens Bully. The space is exciting and inviting, but they have a ton of work to do to make this place any good.
My first time was 12/2013 and I gave them a 3. Unfortunately I wasn't detailed as to why. Just said I was underwhelmed. This time, 9/8/17 I had a totally different experience at the bar. Service was perfect.  Ordered the grilled calamari sofrito which was super tasty. The Cavatelli pasta was insanely yummy, the sauce could go with anything! The grilled lamb with sausage and greens was great too. A far better flavor profile experience than four years ago. I'll be back!
My boyfriend and I made a Friday 7:30p reservation a few weeks ago, if you are lucky sometimes they'll have one spot open the day of. After we got seated, I noticed there were a few empty tables that never got filled during my stay, so my guess is that those are for the walk ins.  The atmosphere here is undeniably intimate and the service is great. They have a lot of tables in the restaurant with some big round tables in the corner. Our table is in close proximity to our neighboring table (less than 5 feet away) For appetizer, we ordered the crab toast. It was really good! I think the white sauce covered the crabmeat taste a little bit. This dish is definitely refreshing but the taste of it mainly come from the natural taste of the crab rather than a well thought creation from the chef.  For main meal, my boyfriend ordered the sea bass and I ordered the bow tie pasta with veal meatballs. They are both delicious. I am just a little disappointed because they tasted ordinary. You come here definitely for the quality and freshness of the food and the atmosphere. If you're looking for a dish that will blow your mind away, then this is not the place.
After having dinner here, my friend and I all got stomachache. There should be some problems with the food.
It's unfortunate how this place has gone downhill. The food (some of it) is still worth the wait, however people don't go to restaurants just to eat. It's a holistic experience from beginning to end and I'm literally STILL in the restaurant writing this... the service was that bad.  The waiter was not only rude and rushed us during dinner, he ROLLED HIS EYES at us when we asked for more time to decide. I'm sorry if you hate your job but don't take your anger out on your customers.  Don't come here on any days other than Friday or Saturday if you want to actually enjoy your time.  Compliments to the chef.
"Pretty positive this is top 5 on my list for worst service.  It was a Saturday afternoon, table for 2. We sat outside first but the wind was unbearable so we were quickly moved inside.  We had to ask if we could order drinks after about 10 minutes. Then probs after another 10 minutes we asked if we could order lunch.  My wrap noted it came with ranch. I joked with the server, ""now don't forget that ranch"" -- 'twas forgotten.  We waved a server down to ask for the ranch. No one ever came after that.  We asked the hostess if we could pay, then a different server came over and asked if we would like another round of drinks. Huh? Am I on boiling points right now?  Shame shame because our meals were tasty.  We were the best servers there."
First off, the food was good (other than my charred steak that was supposed to be medium rare). But the service sucked. I'm not even a snob about service when I go out. I just want a good experience and mutual respect. I am picky as hell when it comes to the food though, LOVE a great steak and easily know more about steak than 90% of people. I was treated like I was overly picky and didn't know anything about steak which was just a small part of the experience, but terribly disappointing. Having zero dry aged steaks on menu makes me think they prefer an uneducated diner who just comes for the polished utensils and fancy environment. Sorry people, it's a long one. Story is below but here are the cliff notes: - brought friends from LA to NY - my off menu prime dry aged ribeye was ordered medium rare and came out clearly over cooked. How TF does a high end Steakhouse do this to one of their most expensive off menu items? You're a STEAKHOUSE and I order a PRIME DRYAGED RIBEYE - waiter misunderstood the server and brought it out even more burnt. Took him a while to figure it out and was absolutely not appropriately apologetic for the situation. Maybe he was embarrassed, but he didn't handle it correctly.  - correct (correct enough) steak came out around 10 minutes later but waiter was unfriendly and borderline rude for the remainder of our dinner - no management came to apologize. No discount or removal of the steak was offered. - I spent a little over $500 for a terrible experience. I will never be back. There are too many epic steakhouses in NY to risk another terrible experience at Del Friscos. I hope this review deters even just a few. Look into Keens, Ruth's Chris or Peter Luger. Full version below: Clarification: Waiter and server were two different people. My wife and I brought another couple who are really good friends of ours to NY as a wedding gift. This was one of our many foodie stops. Service was good until my steak came out. I thought all or most of Del Friscos steaks were prime, dry-aged. They're not. In fact dry aged steaks are an off menu item that you have to ask for and I found that out by talking to our waiter. I ended up ordering the off menu prime dry-aged ribeye, medium rare for something like $132. Side note, I've dined at a lot of high end steakhouses and this was priced much too high for the mid-high-end steakhouse Del Friscos is. But I never come to a steakhouse for a wet aged steak so I happily agreed, expecting an amazing steak and experience.  My steak came or and was noticeably overcooked. The server asked me what I had ordered, I said medium rare, he said oh that's definitely not medium rare and asked everyone else to cut theirs to see if maybe the plates were mixed on accident. No one else had my steak so he apologized and said they would prepare another immediately. It was a bummer and seems like a terrible (and embarrassing) mistake for a high-end STEAKHOUSE to make with an expensive off menu steak but we had sides that I could start on so everyone else could eat and I didn't make a big deal about it. The steak came back out a few minutes later, charred, carried by our waiter this time. Our waiter loudly and without notice placed it on the table and asked if it was fine. I looked at him confused and told him it was overcooked from the start and I wanted a medium rare steak. He looked annoyed for a few seconds but I could see him starting to realize that there was some sort of major miscommunication going on between the server, waiter and chef. He left with the steak and said he would get it figured out. At this point I started to go from quietly annoyed to politely angry and dramatically disappointed. He returned a minute later with a very short, empty apology and said a new steak was being prepared. Everyone was half way through their steak when the server brought out my fresh ribeye. Clearly rare, which wasn't a big issue. Medium rare is my favorite but I can definitely enjoy a rare steak and didn't want to wait any longer so I told him it was fine. I felt like he did it on purpose to be sure that I wouldn't think it was over done again. Which was childish because the first steak was simply over cooked. The server agreed. I wasn't just being picky. Cook the steak right! You shouldn't need to aim for undercooked to be safe. Just cook the steak right! After this our waiter didn't stop by for 10-15 minutes. He returned to ask us if we wanted our check, didn't offer desert. He didn't offer any other apology about the mistakes. Didn't offer to remove it from the check. Zero remedy. I paid a little over $500 for 4 people to have a disappointing experience at Del Friscos in NYC. Bummer, but we left and made the best of the night. I will absolutely not be back there are too many great steak houses in NY to risk a similar experience.
Want a waiter who ignores you and gives you incredibly disgusting attitude when they serve fried dumplings with COLD meat inside, this is the place.  Staff is BEYOND rude that no matter how good the food is, all you taste is the crap the waiter serves with their attitude. Save your money. You can get free crap laying on the streets.
Loved the ribs and the beer but could use a few more side dishes. Wish there was a BBQ place that didn't involve so much waste - paper plates, plastic forks etc - or at least better recycling. Fun place for the kids to run around, although this may not be a plus for everyone.
Great little spot in Ridgewood but nothing noteworthy. The food and drinks are just OK, but if you're looking to just hang back with a couple friends and have a few beers the ambiance is right for just that.
Malaysian Chinese restaurant in the Manhattan Chinatown area. Had a good crowd waiting during Saturday night, but my friend and I got lucky and only had to wait a few minutes for a small table. Insides were packed... just like what'd you expect from Chinatown. We ordered a few Malaysian specialties. For appetizers, we got the Roti Canai (kind of like a naan, but puffed up and comes with chicken curry for dipping) and the Poh Piah (Malaysian spring roll), and both were pretty good. For main dishes, we had the Asam Laksa (noodle soup) which had a slightly sour flavor that opens up the appetite; the Hokkien Char Mee (stir fried noodles) which was very flavorful, and it tasted quite close to some Chinese chow mein that I had before; and lastly, Nasi Lemak, which should have had a bit more coconut flavor on the rice.  Overall, the food was pretty good. My friend who is Malaysian said it was the best Malaysian food he had in the US. The two appetizers plus three main dishes came to $45 including tips, which was not very expensive at all. Last note is that the place is cash only, so be sure to have a few bills in your wallet before going.
"Two stars for the mostly-tasty food. Zero stars for the service, most notably the condescending bartender with the barrette and mustache. They squeezed us, four people, into a tiny table in the corner instead of letting us push two tables of the same size together because ""those tables are for 2 people"" and ""that's policy."" I suggested that perhaps we could push these tables together and we would move should parties of 2 come in, and they still refused, adding that we ""were taking WAY too long to make a decision about where we want to sit."" Of course no parties of 2 showed up during our meal. Once we were seated, they said we needed to push the table further into the corner. Unbelievable. One of many examples of restaurants in Manhattan that think the quality of the food justifies pretentious, inconsiderate service."
"TL;DR You're paying for what you get. And since you're not paying much, definitely don't expect to get much either. I stopped by this establishment recently with a few friends. I noticed immediately that it was prime dinner time yet the place was rather quiet. Should've taken this as a warning sign but I decided to stick around anyway. Got the little hot pot (glass noodle, cabbage, black mushrooms) with fish slices. It wasn't bad, a little on the bland side, but I also don't mind food like that. My friend was utterly unimpressed with her seafood ramen and said she wished she had just made her own at home. Another friend got the bao bao rice, which turned out to be just ground beef and peppers stir fry on top of rice. It was the most simple, underwhelming and bland dish. Bao Bao Cafe was a place I wanted to like, but unfortunately we all left there feeling unsatisfied. Hilarious how one reviewer below me says this place is (and I quote) ""literally the best Chinese I've ever had in New York outside of Chinatown."" I cannot say I agree with that line at all. But, if you're just looking for a quick cheap bite in the Baruch area, then this is the place to be."
U no way  i give 1 star i Oder Dal  nan rice is not good Dal not good i pay 25 Doller every think is garBige Dal tast like tomatoes soup
By far the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant. My family of 9 came to this restaurant to celebrate my birthday and didn't make it past the salads. I ordered my salad told her no tomatoes because I am allergic. She brings my salad with tomatoes. I remind her and she brings me a new salad. I take tree bites of my salad and (that appears to have no tomatoes on it) instantly have an allergic reaction. My husband asks the lady if she is sure no tomatoes touched the salad because I am having a reaction and she says no. He asks her if they have any Benadryl she says no. Not one time does she even ask if I am okay. We ask for togo plates because at this point we must leave to get me something. We did not even take one bite of our meal. I tell her to warn the kitchen staff that there may be some mixup because I am having a reaction to something and she tells me THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE. I tell her again just warn the kitchen cause something caused this I have allergies to nothing else. Smh like I am warning her so this does not happen to someone else. She goes away to get the plates in no hurry. However the bus boys could not clear our plates fast enough to get a new family onto our table. Then we ask for the bill and knowing we are trying to leave as fast as possible she takes her sweet time. Finally I go and request a manager who should have already came to our table to see what was going on. I mean we did wait over an hour for this table after driving 2 hours to get here and dropped nearly 300 dollars. When he came over I was just so upset that this is how we were treated and that my birthday was ruined that I told him the short of it. This is the worst place I ever been to and honestly I think she messed something up in the kitchen cause why not have the manager check on me or care if someone drops dead in their place of business. But in the end of it everyone seen us rushing to pack up the food that just came to our table and no one thought to come and help or ask why we leaving in such a rush. Smh what a waist of money, time and my celebration. Thank God it was me having an allergy and not one of the 4 children with us cause they would have left us for dead. Do not waist your money or time in a place that does not care about the people that are in their restaurant.
Amazing steak. Cooked perfectly, and was the best I've ever had. All of the sides and starters were equally delicious. The waitstaff was charming and hilarious...they even teased us about eating bread but not finishing our steak. Environment is like old German pub. Cash only! Make sure you bring a lot.
Soild mid-day lunch.. very nice atmosphere and the food is good but not knock your socks off.. Italian food is a very hard sell in New York City and especially in Brooklyn.. but this olace holds its own...great idea of serving brunh everyday and the lunch specials are cool... currently they have to many menus and need to streamline that a little bit... but i will definitely  be back for dinner at some point. ..looking forward  to that
hated the service, everyone seemed to be having a hard day, our server Kevin basically threw the bill to me. Not cool dude.
I was in Chinatown working and decided to stop by here for some lunch at 1:20pm. Walked in  and I could tell it was semi packed because it's around late lunch time. We were seated very quickly and we placed our order of 2 Rotis and half a Hainanese chicken and the chicken costed $12.95 around 1:25pm. I watched as many other costumers got their Rotis and food, while my friend and I waited for 45 mins for 1 Roti and the 2nd roti came out about 4 mins afterwards. After a few more mins our chicken came out. The service was a little slow today. I was eating the Hainanese chicken and it was very dry & my friend said it had an odd taste to it but I believe it was just the sauce. I was a little disappointed in the chicken today. The roti was pretty good, but the curry sauce that came with it was a little too chunky for me. As another table sat next to my friend and I they received their food much faster than me. Service 4  Food 4  Atmosphere 6
I would honestly give this place five stars if my order was ever correct! I have now been here three times. Each time I have gotten a custom salad. Every single time items have been missing or things I didn't order wound up on my salad. Wanted to believe it was just a mishap but after this third time I am unsure if I will return. The kitchen seems disorganized. Besides this the concept is great and staff is friendly. Lots of places to eat and if you are a solo diner this is an easy place to eat alone.
Decent food. We came here on a Monday night because it was close to Rockefeller Center. I got the tamales, and they were decent, nothing special. Serivice was great and the owner gave us a free desert, which was delish.
They took very long time prepare you order when you order online for take out. Bad customer service
"Ordering from Adrienne's was truly one of the worst catering experiences I've ever had. Delivery was over an hour late even though I had placed the order the day before. I was repeatedly told the order would arrive in 5 minutes, one hour later. This place was happy to charge my credit card the day before and then deliver my order at their convenience because of the ""lunch rush"" which every other NYC restaurant can handle just fine. Adrienne's caused me to miss an important meeting and left several people without lunch since it arrived too late. This is an embarrassment of an establishment and I will never go back."
My friend and I ventured out to Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn for some Nashville Fried Chicken. This spot only opens up for dinner during the weekdays. My friend and I were one of the first customers arriving that evening and this place quickly fills up upon opening its doors. I typically enjoy spices in my food therefore, I was pretty excited to try the food here.  We shared the Barbecue Shrimp with Fried Grits, Hot Chicken, Blackened Catfish, and sides of the Collard Greens and Mashed Potatoes.  Our appetizer, Barbecue Shrimp with Fried Grits was probably the best dish of the evening. Jumbo shrimp pieces in a sweet and sour barbecue sauce topped with crispy, fried grits. The Fried Grits had to be my favorite part, it was light and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. YUM! Hot Chicken (Hot), the moment we been waiting for is here. Lovely golden brown colored with cayenne pepper. At first bite, the crispy skin was super fluffy and crunchy while the meat was tender. I did enjoy the spicy kick of the cayenne pepper. However, the fried chicken did not come to us pipping hot but room temperature and the inner meat really had no flavor even though it was marinated.  Blackened Catfish with Smoked Jalapeno Remoulade. I really thought I was going to like this dish since it will be heat packed but it was not. The side green salsa tasted like a toned down version of the Spanish hot green sauce. I would skip it. Side of Collard Greens were really good with bitter and saltiness taste to it. Very healthy tasting. Mashed potatoes was just topped with scallions. I actually did like the plain mashed potatoes but wish that it was smashed a bit more for there were some crumbs of potatoes in it.  As a fried chicken lover, I probably will not come back again for it. As a person born and raised in Brooklyn, this is one of the very few times that I have been to Bed-Stuy and just a side note for those who are curious, yes, this neighborhood is gentrified.
Just ordered in from this place.  Vegetable pad Thai, vegetable lo main and a California roll. The entrees lacked major flavor and only had a few pieces of broccoli as the vegetable. Usually when ordering vegetable version there should be at least 3 different types of vegetables. The noodles were over cooked to a mush. The California roll was also very mushy and just not good altogether. This is the 2nd time we gave this place a chance since end of December 2016. It wasn't good then and I can confidently say it's worse this time around. They need to get a new chef. Definitely not giving this place another chance. Will take my money elsewhere.
Definitely a place to go to if you miss some hometown Asian food. Totally should try the Laksa and their chilli is dope. Friendly boss that allowed us in even though we were late and had a lot of baggage. Totally worth the try.
Disclaimer: My idea of great restaurant service is different from the opinion of fellow New Yorkers because I've probably been influenced from living in New Zealand. To me, it's not necessarily the speed that counts but the quality of the interaction between customer and server- whether or not staff made conversation and built rapport. I feel like I'm missing something because everyone raves about Thai Villa. The best way I could describe the service is standoff-ish but efficient. It was fast but the personalities from the staff don't stand out to me. I like folks who smile and are friendly (personal preference). I ordered the beef pad see ew and it was average. I've had better and cheaper elsewhere. One thing I can't fault them on is the decor- it's beautiful and a great date spot. I'm glad I can say that I checked this off my list but that's about it.
Ate at Adrienne's for a quick taste of NYC pizza. Enjoyed the Stone Street experience. The round pizza was delicious!!  Highly recommend for a great pizza experience in the Financial District.
"Peaches HotHouse has been on my bookmarks of places to try for over a year now and I finally got the opportunity to get here and see what the rave was all about but somehow I missed the fact that they were a very tiny and for me uncomfortable establishment. Peaches is in fact a hothouse in that it is tiny and cramped and definitely not my thing so I'm not coming back to dine in here but as for the food it was everything I expected and I will do take out here only. To further sully things we had a not so eager to serve, laid back and lazy server by the name of Silvana who seated us, gave us menus, we got our food and expressed interest to our server that we would like to order from the appetizers menu as well but we were never asked or looked upon again until we stopped her and inquired about drinks and additional napkins.  When I asked Silvana about their drinks menu and what she would recommend she simply said "" You have the menu, take a look at it""! No quick rundown on what's popular, no question on what I might like, Just look at the menu! OK... this was a sticking point for me as her attitude came across as disinterested and lackadaisical. We had a look at the drinks menu and waited, and waited, and watched Silvana walk by us several times, never, ever again to stop and ask if we had a chance to look at the menu and or if we were interested in ordering anything. Just complete and utter nothingness!! This affected my dining experience in a very negative way as no one wants to be treated like that and I certainly didn't appreciate it! Both my friend and I decided that we would flag down someone else and inquire about drinks and the like and a very nice gentleman came along and was happy to explain drinks and give recommendations and this I appreciate and what I was hoping our server would do. I also let the gentleman know of our experience with Lazy Silvana who is certainly going to ruin this place business if she isn't dealt with quick. We got our drinks and perhaps someone mentioned something to her because the next time she came our way I looked up and she gave us an ice cold stare with her lips pursed and her eyes winced and in a glower looking straight at me and this was incredulous to say the least. At this point I decided that I no longer wanted her to service our table and I let the other server know this! Of course they couldn't see the look on her face that she gave me and neither was I going to waste my time at this point saying so but just make sure she doesn't come back here and I left it at that and wont be back. Now on to the food as you can see from my very lengthy review the food was no longer on my palate of good things since a single shitty server impacted what could have been a much better dining experience and review. Both my friend and I got the Hot chicken mine was the hot, my friend the regular and yep the chicken is banging, its got great crunch, spice, flavor and still moist and juicy on the inside! Our Grits were creamy goodness and the drinks not bad at all! Final Thoughts... I don't do tiny, cramped, back to back seating places well, the food was damn good and I will do take out here and that's only if I'm in the area and in the mood for it! The fact that we drove out of our way to come here with such high hopes and have our dining experience trampled on by a careless server doesn't sit well with me at all! Silvana needs to take a customer service class and or this place needs to hand her a laid off slip so she understands that they're in the business of customer satisfaction throughout the meal and service and this matters otherwise your bottom dollar is on the line if this becomes a repeat experience for your other customers! Catch you on the check-in and take out here."
Food was ok. Very loud environment. They added service charge w/o any mentions. They use square for payment and just verbally told us the total cost. So there were no chance to check if they added service charge until I got a receipt. Our server was rude and had an attitude. I ended up paying more than 22% tip/service charge for ''super ok service''.
I dropped by Thursday Kitchen for its Korean/Asian fusion approach to tapas, and was enjoyed a wonderful dinner with a good atmosphere, solid bites, and wonderful service. Between my friend and I, we had the eel tacos, kimchi paella, chicharron, seafood pancake, and tuna tataki. The quality was solid overall, but with some ups and downs. The big hit was definitely the seafood pancake, which is offered at many a Korean restaurant. The pancake was nice and thick, but was fluffy upon bite, and the seafood definitely was the star, unlike some forgettable ones I've had. Plus, the ponzu was perfect, and you can either have the waiter pour it over the entire pancake or to the side. The eel tacos were decent, but I was hoping for something with more umami, like a piece of unagi sushi. This eel was cooler in temperature, but still rather buttery and tasty. I would also point out the paella, which can also go wrong; however, this one did not err. The saffron and parmigiano cheese definitely enriched the rice, and the mussels were incredibly tender. The entire menu looks appetizing, and I will have to find an excuse to come back for the soft shell crab and pork belly taco. And maybe the glow-up drinks too.
Good spot in an area of town in need of one just like it.  Great selection of beers on tap to get you started and excellent appetizers to choose from.  The sesame tuna tartare is a standout but the lamb lollipops are not to be missed.  Follow that up with the flavorful Park Burger with the chef's sauce, closest thing to a gourmet Big Mac going.
"WORST Experience by Far!! Cramped & rundown inside, next to subway with obnoxious servers trying to act overly ""French"" with fake accents. Food - With Overdone sauces on appetizers. Our order - Overlooked stake and Lobster, how can one get that wrong?  Best of all - as per the owner, ""it says on our menu that we take AMEX only"" ..OMG!!! had to look for an ATM to pay for food. How about mentioning we haven't a clue about running a restaurant on your sticky menus!! Neve ever again in this deplorable establishment."
Good spot for groups. The food is a little better than average, but there are soooo many GREAT spots in the neighborhood.  Pros:  - Easy to make a reservation - Big menu with lots of options - Friendly staff - Amazing French fries Cons: - Tight space - bathrooms were kind of dirty
Great food! It was a bit loud inside but not too terrible. Strolled in on a Sunday around 2/230 and there was a 10-15 minute wait. Not a fan of the coffee here but the omelette special of the day was good and the Panino Di Verdura was amazing. Super fresh ingredients--you can really taste the difference. Would definitely recommend the sandwiches here.
I had the most wonderful lunch here the other day. I was warmly greeted and let the sweet sounds of 90's r&b encamp all around me. Our server didn't miss a beat he warm without being too overbearing or intrusive. In essence he was the perfect waiter.  Now here's where the gates of heaven opened up on this Friday afternoon! The FOOD!!! I can honestly say I wasn't expecting it to be as spectacular as it was! It definitely blew my expectations out of the water. First I had the quinoa salad with fried green tomato slices on top!  This was thee most delicious salad I have ever had! It was perfectly balanced and the tomatoes were not greasy at all! This was the perfect appetizer and got me super excited for the next part of the meal and Soco did not disappoint.    The chicken and red velvet waffle was literally the most amazing thing I've had in a while! The waffle wasn't overly sweet, it was the perfect companion for the chicken. Now this chicken is fried chicken done right! Seasoned through out, crispy on the outside and so juicy on the inside! Did I mention it's organic?!! I know right! As if it couldn't get any better!!!  I haven't stopped raving about this place since my visit! Can't wait to round up a crew and head over there again to indulge and you should do the same!!! Thank you Soco for providing a great meal and atmosphere to match!
"A hole-in-the-wall old school shop. If you've lived in NYC, you would have heard of Tasty Hand-Pulled at some point when you ask someone ""any good recommendations in Chinatown?""  The entire menu is extremely cheap, less than $10 for a meal. I ordered the pan-fried chicken dumplings (6 for $4.25), the pan-fried shrimp noodle ($9) and the beef noodle soup ($7.25).  I want to preface you can tell everything is homemade which is great but...  The dumplings were so greasy...the pan-fried shrimp noodles were the same. So much oil and grease it was difficult to eat. The shrimp noodles only come with 3 shrimp (luckily the dish itself is cheap)  The beef noodle soup was okay. I added black vinegar into the broth to give it some extra flavor. The soup has bok choy which I liked - it's a nice textural element.  The shop itself is really unclean (which is the case in many restaurants in Chinatown) They don't wipe down the tables after customers have eaten. If you peak into the kitchen many of their supplies are on the ground which is unsettling...  The staff is nice which is a plus but I wouldn't come back here."
my stomach was happy and so was my wallet - willie k So after the Syracuse sesh, the boys and I have been craving solid dumplings. Well, I can promise you that we found them at the OG spot Lam Zhou. These dumplings are for fire. If you haven't been here you probably haven't eaten dumplings. I'm considering moving to deep Chinatown (far past canal) just out of convenience for the chili oil and plentiful Sriracha. The deal at this spot is $3 for 8 of chinatowns finest dumplings. Take out a loan, apply for that new Amex, maybe even get some points. What ever you do find $3 for tomorrow so you can have some of these dumplings. Breakdown: Dumplings - covered in detail (see above) Beef noodle soup - gets the job done. Service - heating up. Go now before it's closed for tax evasion.
Came here on Saturday afternoon for a brunch and I was getting the baja style fish tacos. The dish comes with 2 fish tacos, rice, beans along with a tangy mole sauce. Fish is definitely flavorful and got the nice acidity due to the lime, and the mole sauce is on point. (See picture below) The rice and beans are filled with umami flavor and it's really filling, sip it down with a grapefruit soda which is kind of lime-y & refreshing  -- if you like acidity/tanginess then this soda is for you!. Repeat the munching and sipping the soda then now we're in business!  So why only 3 stars? Your service; unfortunately, slightly disappoints. Here are whys: 1. You did not seem to show interest with the customer. I was having a hard time deciding menu and took many minutes before deciding on fish tacos. Wish you were more proactive and offering some assistance, especially for a first time visitor. 2. You know that a customer service is failing when a fellow customer ends up doing your job. I ordered a grapefruit soda just before the meal - and - the neighboring customer who sits next to me at the bar (let's refer her as Mrs. friendly stranger) quickly interjects to make sure I know what a grapefruit is. Since, it sounds to her I was ordering grape soda which is a completely different from grapefruit.   3. Later on, once the food came, you forgot to give me the soda. Again, after a few minutes, Mrs. Friendly Stranger realized I did not have the soda yet and asking for the grapefruit soda to you! Dear Mrs. Friendly Stranger, thank you for your service!  To the restaurant management: Perhaps offer another customer service training refresher course??
"YUM! Came here starving after a long drive from Boston. Normally our go to place is Kung Fu XLB, however they had just closed when we arrived. Nan Xiang is open late (till 1am) and had good reviews, so we went.  Ended up getting the two types of XLB, 1 pork and 1 crab/pork. The dumplings were so incredibly juicy and full of soup, more soupy than most places I've been to. The meat was good as well. The only criticism I would say is that the skin could've been a little thinner, although they probably make it a bit thicker in case it punctures and all that flavorful soup comes running out (worst thing that could happen).  We also got the Shanghai Pan Fried Udon noodles, which were pretty damn basic, since it really only had 3 ingredients (noodles, pork, and a couple slices of bok choy) +soy sauce. If you're familiar with Chinese cuisine, the taste is EXACTLY the same as ""gong Chau know hoh"" which is the flat noodles with beef commonly served at dim sum. I really enjoy just eating noodles without a lot of ads ins though so it was good enough for me."
"I really wish I could give zero stars but that isn't an option unfortunately. Yesterday 10/29/17, myself and my youth group went out to eat and we decided on Joya. As soon as we walked in, we informed a waiter that we are a group of 10 adults and two small children and was taken to an area with tables pushed together. The first problem was when we requested a booth instead of tables because we were with TWO SMALL CHILDREN and was told, ""No. We don't put large groups in a booth"" ???? I've never heard this in my life as booths are usually reserved for large groups but after trying to explain why we need a booth and the host not budging, we decided to let it go. ALSO, this was at about 5pm while it was POURING RAIN and the restaurant only had about two other customers, why couldn't we be accommodated? Second problem was when we asked for a booster seat/high chair for the kids and was told no. The host then argued with the father of the child and told him that he never puts his own kids in a high chair. Um ok? Cool story bro but we like to put our kids in high chairs/booster seats lol. FINALLY, the host realized that we were one person short and refused to let us sit and demanded that a group of 9 adults and 2 young children should just stand by the door and wait. I would understand this policy if the restaurant was actually packed but it was EMPTY. We told the host that our last guest was literally walking to the restaurant but of course, refused to budge and and instead kept yapping about ""policies"". I honestly felt like the host didn't want to deal with a group of African-American people and the whole experience left a horrible taste in my mouth. We had no choice but to go back into the rain again and head up the block to LEMONGRASS GRILL. And let me just say, it was a MUCH BETTER EXPERIENCE. We were accommodated immediately and treated with actual respect. PLEASE AVOID JOYA IF YOU CAN, THEY DON'T HAVE THE FRIENDLINESS OR HOSPITALITY REQUIRED TO RUN A RESTAURANT."
I had the fettuccine with portabello. It costs $3 to add the portabello and what do you get? A small piece hacked up into four strips. The sauce was okay, it wasn't too favorable or salty.   Overall, the meal was a disappointment and I will not be back.
The marscapone cheesecake is consistently amazing. The host underestimated the wait by OVER ONE HOUR but we still waited. Worth it.
They have like ten things on the menu and ran out of half of them.  What kind of restaurant doesn't have ingredients??  Waitress/bartender sucked too. She was in her phone the whole one and didn't even bring water. Wtf
average ramen at Oramen, unfortunately since it s only 3 blocks away from where i work. service very fast and attentive, space clean and spacious, ramen bland, without character or personality, the broth is the main weakness. the tonkotsu too thin..lacks the silkiness and flavor of a good bone broth, the noodles were perfectly cooked but that was it. the gyoza overstuffed, came with the skin broken. the mazemen  didn t even taste good, muddy and underscrptive is a far cry from the shining and bright cod-lemon mazemen i had at chuko. really 2 bad.  really 2 stars
Everyone loves this place but I don't get it, it's just OK. Always a long wait no matter what time or day. Drinks are good but food is just OK. I guess this is one of the better places to eat if stuck in Staten Island. Cute ambiance.
Definitely a soup nazi establishment. The food is so good people will put up with very rude service and a pretty volatile owner to eat there. Just follow the George Castanza rules for buying soup. Ask quietly for your food, slide to the right and don't make eye contact with the owner.
My friends decided to celebrate new years at this restaurant because 99% of people were moldovians, including myself. Worst idea ever.  #1 The meal we paid was 100$ each. With 18% service charge, 105. Later on they said we must pay more service charge because those 18% were for the people who arranged the tables. Never heard of that before, but Ok in the end each person ended up paying about 120$. It does not sound THAT terrible.   #2 The food is tasty, but they serve you very little. If you were enthusiastic to try the traditional food mamliga, be prepared to have a very small bite of it because they will serve you half the portion they are supposed to. (This refers to birthday parties or big eveniments).  #3 For the entire table for new years for 10 people, we were served with only few salads, few pieces of fish, some sausages ( I can buy them myself at the store), another big fish in the middle of the table and with no coffee or tea ( very unusual, because I have been there before and we always had tea and coffee). Oh the the best - spoiled strawberries, dried watermelon, good pineapple. 1 PIECE OF CAKE , 2 baked apples for our table - we were again 10 PEOPLE.  I asked for more cake and they brought another 1 PIECE OF CAKE . Such a joke.  #4 Somebody stole my friend's phone because when we started to look for it we couldnt find it. My friend had no alcohol because he drove the guests back at home. After we moved the chairs and coats to look for the phone without luck, it appeared on the floor right where we were looking. I found it extremely strange. The same night another phone was missing from our next table, as well our friends. It could have been some of our friends, it could have been the waiters -Mystery unsolved. I am not blaming,but if you go watch for your stuff.  I would not advise to make big celebrations there because the service is spoiled.  A lunch or a small dinner where you know exactly what you order and how much you are supposed to get without being cheated on with money - it is a far better experience.  The salads are good, the mamliga is good and placinte, mici, potatoes with mushrooms, Do not go there for parties because they will charge money and have poor meals for the table. There are some good waiters, some of them are lazy, forgetful.  I would not go there a second time, nor I do not trust the quality of the food.
That's one damn meaty LoBSTaH Roll! Seriously, that was one of the most stuffed pieces of buttery soft crisp breads I have shoved into my mouth in a long time. Utterly delicious lobster, so fresh, and cooked just right. So tender and melt in your mouth at the same time. Orgasmic. Oh yeah, start off with the yummy fried clam strips and down them with a cold craft beer from their full bar. Foreplay. Plenty of seating inside, patio seating on the front sidewalk, terrific service, and funky decor clean bathroom. Pure pleasure. A bit on the pricey side but should be expected when eating seafood of this quality. If it wasn't so much of a hike to get to from the UES I might be here more often. A must visit to enjoy life in all it's gluttony when in the Red Hook area.
The service at the front of the restaurant is terrible. We were a party of 3 and one of my friends was running very late. We asked if we could be seated as 2 of us were there already. The hostess said to give her a minute, but she then ignored us for the next 15 mins (yes, our friend was extremely late!) even though we asked her twice. The entrance / waiting area wasn't large so we were standing in the way of people entering and leaving. Very uncomfortable. The hostess knew we wanted to be seated but just didn't care. When our friend finally arrived, it took them another 10 minutes to get organized and to seat us. The ventilation in the restaurant is also pretty bad - we walked out smelling like fried food.  It's a shame because the food was actually quite decent but we collectively agreed that the service was very uncalled for and will not be returning!
Nothing really to complain about the food but the customer service is disappointing. The lack of respect for the customers can be seen when the waiters ridicule the customers in Spanish behind their backs.
Solid restaurant here!  Food is so good and the staff is so nice.  The chicken and waffle dish is perfect.  Not too greasy.  Also very kid friendly.
I can't believe I paid 3 additional dollars to have 3 small shrimps in my dish. Also, my friend got 4 shrimps in his pad Thai for 3 dollars. It is not their first time doing this for delivery. Now I won't odrder it anymore.
"Food was mediocre and the customer service SERIOUSLY SUCKED. We dined in for lunch and when we wanted to order 2 more orders of takoyaki and have them pack it for us, they did not want to, because of their ""no take out policy""  Even though we were sitting at a table and obviously dining in. There was a girl with short hair like a men's hair cut and wore glasses, who kept telling us they couldn't put in our order because we weren't going to eat it in the restaurant. And we kept telling her to bring it to our table since we were already dining in. She kept giving us a hard time and was EXTREMELY rude. When she walked towards the back I could see her and the other workers talking and saw her shaking her head. Seriously she should be fired for such bad customer service. I would NEVER come here again."
Foods are Great, But Phone Order taker always messed up our Orders. something missing, or wrong item, also Their delivery time is always delayed and off. This happened TOO MANY TIMES! Spoke to Manager but it seems like they don't care. We've been ordering a few times a week for over 1 year, and still the same problems. I don't think any customer like this when they order. BEWARE!
Actually now open for brunch. Always amazing food. I really recommend the breakfast burger and the Guava Mimosa. Defiantly one of the best brunch places in NYC. Small but cozy.
DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU VALUE YOUR HEALTH. I was incredibly disappointed by this place, I don't understand how it has so many reviews and 4 stars. While eating the food, I was actually getting a stomachache from this shitty food. Food is incredibly oily, and tastes like the chef used the same pan for all the foods he cooked. Also not really a Malaysian place; more like a Chinese place that just tries to offer random menu items and slaps 'Malaysian' on the name.  First, the Roti canai is not really roti canai - usually it's a bit more soft, but this one was like a cracker. And the sauce was just pure oil and fat. Then the chicken came and my god I have not had a dryer chicken - after two bites I felt like cardboard was filling my mouth. Then the Nyonya fried noodles came and wow I was blown away by mediocrity. It was incredibly oily, ingredients were not fresh at all (ESP the shrimp), scallop had sand in it. The watercress was a bit better, but still tasted like they had cooked it in the same pan with other foods. Additionally, we ordered white rice that just never came. Despite this subpar service, they automatically charge a 15% tip when honestly I want to leave 0 tip. Especially given my queasy stomach post meal. Seriously if I could I would want to sue them for being in business and serving this type of food to customers.
Dinner Review: We had a lovely dinner at Jane. We started with the meatballs appetizer which was amazing. It came with a garlic bread. Perfect pair. The entrees on the table were a Margherita pizza, Seafood Cobb Salad, and the Toasted Ricotta Gnocchi. The pizza was a special - it was classic and good. The Seafood Cobb salad was good. The gnocchi was really interesting - it was really rich - i'd recommend the small size because as it is I couldn't finish. We had milk and cookies for dessert - so great! I'd recommend Jane and i'd love to come back for brunch.
Delicious chicken and biscuit sandwich. Only thing it was missing was a nice crunch from a fresh veggie. Hoping to go back and try something new. Also went during happy hour and had a delicious beer. Definitely check this place out!
Quite possibly the worst tapas restaurant I have ever eaten at. Seriously, Michelin recommended? Came last Friday and unknowingly made it before happy hour. Ordered a pitcher of sangria at a solid deal of $20 and will start of saying that this was the only decent item of the evening. The Happy Hour menu has a pretty extensive list of tapas- around half-off what you would otherwise pay. We ordered las croquetas de pollo, patatas bravas, cold cuts, paella, and the chorizo.  The croquetas were just alright- had a nice crisp to them but pretty bland. The patatas bravas were awful- boiled potatoes stacked on each other on top of a tiny amount of tomato-based sauce with a lump of quite possibly the most bland aioli sauce I have ever tasted.  The paella was horrendous- the rice was severely undercooked, it tasted like something that came from a Walmart brand of instant bagged rice. ( so bad that even with two people we only finished maybe half of it) The chorizo, although very small, was pretty tasty and full of flavor. Last but not least, the cold cuts.... I wish I had more to say about this, but, we never got it. The service was pretty minimalist- nothing offensive and at $50...I guess I am only half as upset had I shown up after happy hour...
So this place requires reservations it's not either or which wasn't specified very well by Yelp then I registered with OpenTable put in my information and then by the time I finished registering Open Table app told me that the time i wanted was not available meanwhile the Open Table app actually made the reservation sent me an email not a confirmation while I was on the website. I showed up at the place hoping for a table and the hostess told me that didn't have space i told her i had trouble with the app. But she didn't check. they told me they don't have any space and so I left and then I get charged $150 fee because apparently OpenTable made the reservations and basically said that I didn't show up when I did. I've called belle harlem several times and they have not gotten back to me at all. so I'm in the middle of disputing the charge because I did show up and I was told that there was no space so yeah the place is really small people may like that whole quaint cozy thing but I don't like to be up on people so the place really wasn't for me and I wasn't sure I would go back but now after this Fiasco with OpenTable and everything I'm definitely not going back!!!!
Food was alright, menus are lack of diversity. It's pretty standard compared to all jap restaurants. Servers are attentive though. If you look for surprise, you may be disappointed
"Came here for the first time and I'm ready to go back. They have a great variety of different banh mis to choose from - traditional ingredients with fun names. I had the ""green eggs and ham"" which was the Vietnamese ham, TWO eggs and green sauce. They were nice and made mine not too spicy. The sandwich was huge and I like that they cut it in half for you in separate wrappers. The bread was fresh with a nice crust on the outside and soft inside. The typical toppings of cilantro, daikon, carrots, cucumber and mayo were also fresh AND refreshing. I really like the mixed taste of the warm bread/meat/eggs coming together with the cold toppings. The only thing is that I should have had the eggs cooked ""runny"". I asked for medium thinking it was going to be like over-easy but it was pretty much fully cooked. The space is small but bright and airy. The cashier was very friendly and efficient.Bathroom clean."
I really wanted to like this place and was excited to try it because of the reviews..but was pretty disappointed after my meal.  The restaurant itself is pretty cute. Very small, but both the indoor and outdoor area provide a nice ambiance (although outdoor caused more than a couple mosquito bites..eughh) However, most of the food was bland and not authentic at all. I'm all for fusion and inspired dishes, but most of them fell very flat. We ordered: - deviled eggs (4/5) - good spices/flavor - coconut kale (2/5) - a bit salty, a little bland - beef rendang (2/5)  - fish curry (3/5) - donuts (1/5) - especially disappointing since it was their special/highly recommended by the waitress. i'm not a picky donut connoisseur, but this was just so dry and tasteless - chocolate tart  Our waitress was extremely helpful and really sweet, so at least service was good. I wouldn't return though unless they made a drastic change in their chef or menu.
I've been eager to try this place out since it's always so crowded. The least amount you should expect to have to wait in line for dinner is like 20 mins. I went there once but left cause the line was too long. So, finally I gotta try it and was somewhat disappointed. My friends and I came in three on a Saturday night. We had to wait for around 40 mins to be seated. We ordered the signature pork belly, beef bulgogi with rice wrapped in (?) leaves, clam japchae, and subdubu. I liked the clam japchae a lot. Actually it was the only dish I like. The rice wrap thing had a kind of weird smell. Also I didn't think the boiled pork belly was really good. It was tender but lack of flavor and chewiness of the skin.  A lot of tasty-looking dishes on the menu that I wanted to try but not sure I will come back because of the long waiting.
Food: okay. Compared to Cafe China, the food here is not so good. I'd say it's average. First some dishes are really oily. Second the portion is a bit small. Service: POOR. We came as a group of 8 people to celebrate my friend's birthday. On the phone they mentioned the cake fee was $2 but when we got there the waiter insisted it was $3 per person as if we were lying to him. His attitude was very bossy which was a piss off for us! Also the water was served very slowly. Environment was great which earned the two stars. Yet considering the food and service, I am not going back here again and I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to people who like authentic Chinese food.
Brand new to Brooklyn - a dose of Miami can be found here in this really cool section of Brooklyn.  I enjoyed absolutely everything - and will let the pictures speak for themselves. Folks - you have to try this place - It's an absolute Gem. The service, the food, the drinks, the flavors, the atmosphere, the music, the everything - is so perfect. The owners know their vision and they bring it to life flawlessly.
This place is an amazing French themed breakfast or lunch option! They serve their own tea, how amazing is that?!  My colleagues and I had a pleasure to have a breakfast at Smith's one rainy day. The city was immersed in the chaos of the pouring heavens, and terrible traffic accompanied by the cacophony of car honks. That's why Smith's calm ambience lured us in, allowing us to reimagine ourselves in a Parisian bistro. I had Eggs Benedict with their signature green tea. The eggs were done great: poached to the right degree with perfect seasoning. The chef was nice to substitute Canadian Ham with smoked salmon.  Even though everything was mostly good, I think the hollandaise sauce was distributed scarcely. I simply would like a bit more sauce to balance out the potatoes which had some herbs along with sugar(!) in their seasoning. While America's doctors are advocating to reduce sugar consumption, many NY restaurants are embracing this controversial ingredient. Overall, the place is good and I would love to taste other items on their menu!
I must say, I had the best ramen I have ever eaten in my life here. They didn't have much choices on their menu, which is a good thing! As an appetizer, I ordered the chicken wings and they were juicy, tender and i realized the main bone was missing. Instead, they filled it with something very delicious and I was surprised by this special dish.  Next, I ordered a ramen that blew my mind. perfectly cooked noodles with bite, not too soft, a very umami broth (tasted like they cooked it for 24 hours in beef bones), the beef they added was tender soft and a bit sweet and just dissolved on my tongue. My girlfriend had another ramen with poached egg on top and she had pork instead of beef. It was incredible how they made pork fat taste so high quality.  All in all, I analysed texture, taste, and the different combinations of ingredients and I was overwhelmed. By far the best ramen I've ever eaten! Quite pricy though, but totally worth it!
Not bad not exceptional. Atmosphere over food 100%.  The wood is beautiful and the open airy feeling is so refreshing. Came in and caught the brunch menu, ordered 2 avocado smashes. While they were super flavorful the toast it's self was more soggy bread than anything. No crunch at all leaving the poached egg and Guac to leave a mushy feeling in your mouth. Strawberry fields drink was very good although the bartender did take about 10 minutes to make it, prompting the server to bring over my moms beer first. 50 dollars for mediocre food and 2 drinks but hey it's new hopefully things will work out.
Yes, I've experienced better at their other location on West 38th St. I regret being lazy and coming here solely because it was closer. I ordered the usual grand slam, however this time I added the natto. I don't think I've ever seen that side as an option. The food was decent, but when you've had better, you know right away. Also for some reason, everything was served in to-go containers and plastic forks. At the other location, I would always get the curry in a metal plate and given a metal fork. Oh well, maybe their dish washer was broken. I'll chalk this one off as this place having a bad day, but next time I'll be sure to go to their other location if at all possible!
So amazing, the food is out of this world, fresh and delicious! I totally loved it, we will defently be back here to try more delish food!
We were very pleasantly surprised by this restaurant.  We ordered a lot of food, including the uni Bimbibap, NY bites, fried tiger roll, fried soy and garlic chicken wings, kimchi pancakes, and fried asparagus.  All the dishes were very favorable with satisfying texture.  Since the flavors are strong rather than subtle, I imagine some people might find some of the dishes to be a bit salty/overpowering, but I happen to like them nonetheless.  The decor and atmosphere are lively with just the right amount of buzz, which goes well with the fun tapa style Asian fusion dining.  The only mild negative is that we found the churros (with ice cream) to be a bit too sweet.  But overall still a great dining experience!
I guess this was a glitch on opentable's part, but I was able to make a reservation at 11am, which is when they are closed to transition over to lunch. My friend was visiting from out of town and staying in the area so I chose this place since I had never tried it before and she was staying in fidi. There was a lot of confusion but they still seated us. We were literally the only people in the restaurant. They seemed frustrated the entire time that we were eating during their transition time. They made us pay early and then we felt like we had to eat quickly and leave ASAP. Definitely not the most welcoming environment given we made a reservation.
This place is BEAUTIFUL. I've only been to the bar for wine but I can't wait to go back. I really want to try the burger. Seriously, go there with a couple girlfriends for wine, or go on an intimate date. It's in such a great spot of Dumbo, close to be waterfront. And the atmosphere is lovely. Oh, and our bartender was great. Very attentive, funny, overall I had a really nice time.
Can I give this place 10 stars?!? One of the best dining experience I've ever had. Great staff, even better menu. The tasting options were simply exquisite. This place impresses!
The shoyu ramen broth was deserving of a solid 4 stars - it was flavorful and warmed my body on a cold, rainy day. However, once I dug deeper I found a few too many offenses - the egg was hard boiled rather than soft, the arugula made every bite bitter and clashed with the savory flavors of the ramen, the pork was cut very thick, making it lack the melt-in-your-mouth effect I look forward to in ramen dishes, and I found a clump of unseparated noodles in the bowl. I think with some edits this place could be great. On the plus side, service was super quick.
So disappointing. Food was terrible and greasy.  Not busy on a Saturday night and I should have known. Will never return.
"I finally got a chance to try this place after having it bookmarked for almost two years. I made a reservation through open table on a Friday for 5:45pm and the restaurant was pretty empty at this time. It slowly started to get more and more crowded as it approached 6:30pm. They have an all you can drink, self serve, beer on tap special for $15 (on a mediocre beer but as my friend said ""beer is beer""). They give you a blue solo cup and you can drink as much as you want for an hour and a half. Now this deal applies to the entire table meaning the first person to start drinking is when the time starts. So even if your friend comes 30 minutes later, he only has an hour left to utilize the deal - which is still plenty of time to get tipsy, you'll just be extremely bloated. The coconut rice is what I recommend everyone and anyone who decides to come here. Prior to Pig & Khao, Sripraphai in Jackson Heights had my favorite coconut rice but Pig & Khao now reigns supreme for me in that department. The pork belly adobo was delicious, the khao soi was good, the sizzling sisig was a bit disappointing in my opinion because it was too dry; Marharlika & Ugly Kitchen makes it better. The halo halo was too runny for my taste but the ube ice cream itself was pretty bomb. I also had the cold coffee horchata which was pretty interesting, but not sure if it was worth the $6 that I was charged for. Would I come back? Yes only because my overall food, service, and experience was pretty on point."
"It seems like most people enjoyed this place so maybe I had unfair expectations but I felt really disappointed. My husband and I went over the summer, not long after they opened. We arrived just after 5 and were told that they opened at 5 but by 5:15 there was no movement and we were still lined up outside.  We finally got in at about 5:25 and maybe this was just a teething issue but they had this bizarre system going where the hostess would come down, escort a party up and then come back down for the next group. Instead of feeling like we were being welcomed, it sort of just felt like we couldn't be trusted to get up the stairs by ourselves. And then it was practically empty inside!! Again, maybe just early days and still working out the kinks. I've been to Cuba (in the 90s) and this place just felt really inauthentic, despite our server assuring us that he had ""lived for two years in Miami"". The inside is beautiful and reminded me of Hotel Nacional but when I mentioned this, he had no idea what I was talking about. I saw the bartender mixed a drink for someone and asked to try whatever that was- I was basically told I couldn't have that one and was pointed to something else.  I wanted to love this place because I have a fond place in my heart for Cuba but just felt disappointed."
Awesome Malaysian food! All dishes ordered exceed my expectations, very pleased to have these authentic dishes in NYC. Price is reasonable and service is fast. Please note they're cash only and very crowded. However, the food is definitely worth the wait.
Service not on par with what I expected for the prices of this restaurant. I went for restaurant week (just by chance)...because I was in town this week for business. I ordered the salad, meatballs, chicken, and some kind of chocolate candy bar dessert. If I were to do it all over again, I would order everything different except the dessert. I would recommend hummus, burrata (maybe), and steak.
Eating here is challenging considering you have to bring your own water and be able to find the end of their perfectly chewy but ridiculously long noodles, but it's part of the experience and it's totally worth it. Unique and delicious.
Can't say how much I enjoy the experience the service was great and the food even greater!!! For it being my first time I really enjoy it
We went in to have lunch at gone around 1145 on a Saturday afternoon during january. It was just two of us and the restaurant was empty. It was really cold in the restaurant we had requested the lady to turn on the heat and she explained that the AC needs to be on and if we are cold, we can feel free to wear our Jackets? Really!! that's your response?  Well that's not all. we ordered Tom Yum soup and apparently they cannot make it vegetarian because it only gets made in lobster broth. So we got Tom Ga which comes in coconut broth but had a very questionable mushrooms included in it. The final straw was the red curry which was in thin broth and I have been to hundreds of thai restaurants, and have never seen red curry being made in orange watery broth. We did not touch the food at all and went ahead and paid. The server never even asked if we enjoyed our food or if we had any questions. Seems like they couldn't wait to get rid of us and take the money. I'm not sure why they have thousand reviews with such good rating, it completely beats me how they are keeping their customers happy. Absolutely poor experience, Will never go back.
Came here for the brunch and got the eggs and bacon. In my opinion the dish lacked flavor and even though it came with toast that looks delicious, it was a little burned. The restaurant itself is very cute though and the service was great! We were seated very quickly and our waiter was great! The food came out very fast. Maybe next time I will try something else on the menu.
Had a random bulgogi craving, so I'm glad I found this place! My boyfriend and I came at the start of happy hour, which included a good amount of tapas and drinks.  Soy Garlic Wings: 6 pieces to an order for happy hour. Not quite as good as regular bon chon places, but they hit the spot.  Corn Cheese: a little pot of melted cheese and corn on the cob. Cheese was delicious (and went pretty well with the bulgogi). I was expecting the kernels to be mixed in, and I wish there were more chips that came with it (there were 6), but whatever. I'd probably order it again  Bulgogi + Rice: sooo good! Pretty good serving size, and the meat was cooked and seasoned well.  Churros: my boyfriend ordered a drink that never came, and when our server found out she removed the drink from our tab and gave us complimentary dessert!  We went at a weird time, so it was pretty empty. That really made me appreciate just how spacious this place is - very open, with a young, trendy vibe.
Pretty disappointed.   Had a recommendation to try this cool looking and cozy spot in the slope and while it has a great vibe (and even better soundtrack playing)... the food was at best meh.  Steak was so bad I had to step into the men's to spit it out.   Clay pot is a fraud.  And bland.   Wings tasted like five day oil.    Shame as the staff are friendly (even though the host made us wait until he finished his personal phone call before he even said hello).
This is definitely one the cleaner places to eat in Chinatown so I'll give it props for that. The food is decent - but the appetizers are above average I would say. However, this place does thai/chinese/viet food so its definitely not the most authentic food out there. There's nothing that blew my mind though and its also cash only.
First, the bread is ridiculously delicious!  If they'd have served it with butter I'd have turned it into an entree.  Salomon was good, cooked more well than the medium that I requested, but still tasty.  Great service and a nice little surprise considering their location.   Thankfully. You Helpers did not disappoint and we were able to find this delicious jewel during our vacation.   Cons:  Pass on the Lobster Mashed Potatoes; no Lobster.
Ok let's see where I start, the atmosphere at Industry is awesome and so are the drinks (mimosas are 2x1). The servers are also super nice and inviting however the service itself is a bit slow. I went with the intentions to have chicken and waffle but instead I received not the traditional drum stick, thigh pieces but a panko crusted chicken beast sliced over a waffle which was not appetizing at all. My fiancé had carne asada which was a better dish, I wish I had ordered that!!! Overall the food was not the greatest so I'll be taking this restaurant off my bookmarks and most of all off my favorites.
Another let down by Yelp here for me.  I walked around looking for a great place to go and this was one of the highly rated places in the area.  You walk in and the place has a friendly bar type of atmosphere to it.  The only issue is how packed it is.  For a tiny place, they stack people up like sardines in here.  Perhaps it was because it was a Friday, but boy was it uncomfortable.  Luckily I was solo, so I found a seat at the bar as someone else who was solo was leaving. I perused the menu and found it lack luster.  I decided that I would go for the Steak Tartar ($16!) and just get a drink ($16) The drink I had, was a makeshift old fashioned with different ingredients to spice it up.  It was just OK...and  for sure not worth the price tag.  The steak tartar came out and was below average on the list of steak tartars I've had.  Grand total for an appetizer and 1 drink after tax and tip was $40....YIKES.  The saving grace here was my bartender, he was very friendly and attentive even though the place was packed.
The management post a comment which was untrue in many ways. I almost uploaded the screen shots of the emails between me and White Oak just because the comment makes me feel even more offended. The first reservation was for 16 people not 30, and White Oak offered to waive the minimum fee IF we push the time of reservation to a later time than when we originally planned which I do not have a problem with as long as it does not look as an act of pure courtesy from the management's side . I also called, and cancelled the event way before the actual time and I mentioned it is because the birthday person has chicken pox.  After trying to book again for which management again asked 500$ minimum  (not including tax and tip)  I mentioned the party has gotten smaller to 12 people. so if they could waive the minimum or lower it if we make the party for a shorter time and. Even if everyone shows up, each persons  will have to spend about 42 dollars ( again not including tax and tip). which I cannot guarantee, and this was more than 24 hours before the actual time we were trying to show up. and there was no getting back by mail phone call or voice mail. again I understand one bar needing a minimum for a party. but that is a very high minimum.  and again most of these conversations are recorded so what really gets me is some one lying, instead of giving a valid argument.
"Really can't believe I haven't written about this place already. Well to begin, it's excellent. From the quaint cozy atmosphere to the enormous pizzas and superb appetizers, Rubirosa should categorized amongst some of the greater pizzerias in NYC. If you don't believe me, test my theory. In a 2-4 block radius there is a few of the top rated New York pies. ""The oldest pizzeria in the country"" Lombardi's is south from Mulberry on Spring street. Further south about another block is Pasquale Jones, and if u hang a right off of Mulberry from Rubirosa there is Prince Street pizza. In my own opinion, Rubi's is where it's at. Rice balls and the roasted octopus are incredibly flavorful as appetizers, and will be excellent ways to start off a pizza date. If you just came for the pizza and want to experience one pie that you won't see at every other pizzeria go for the Tie-Dye. That one comes with both vodka and pesto sauce while their perfectly melty mozzarella shines through. You could also try a half supreme half vodka which allows you to sample their two most popular pies. Vodka sauce on pizzas should be a thing everywhere, and the garlic on the supreme gives the slice a nice kick. It might be of value to know that these are not artisan/Neapolitan style pizzas but are more so incredibly big ultra thin cracker style crust pies. Some may not like the thinness, but Rubirosa is able to cook each pizza so that they do not flop all over the place, but are also not completely burnt on the bottom either. This also means that a huge slice doesn't necessarily fill you up like another type might so order the large. This is my NYC pizza spot. Bye."
Lobster Benedict was average. Lobster claw Bloody Mary? Yums.Usually we have brunch in our neighborhood but traveled here solely for the brunch special with the lobster benedict and lobster bloody mary. I probably wouldn't do it again unless someone else wanted to go. The benedict didn't have much lobster and the hollandaise was bland. The bloody mary had a huge chunk of claw, and the flavor of the bloody mary was good and well spiced. The lobster in the mary was flavorful and fresh, but it definitely could have been fresher. My friend had the crabcake benedict and mimosa. She was unimpressed.
I went here for the first time last night.  Pro's- beautiful view, good music and nice atmosphere, friendly hostess.  Con's- We had a reservation for 7:15, there were at least 8 tables open yet we were still seated 30 minutes later. A few minutes after we ordered we asked to change our meal to non-diary so that my BF who is allergic would be able to share. We were told our food is already done and was about to come out;therefore, we were unable to change our order. This would have been fine if this was not a lie. Our food arrived 30 minutes later, after we asked where it was twice. Our waitress actually checked on us to see how everything was when we did not have any food. They tried to charge us for tap water. The last part which I understand but hate, is you cannot change anything on the menu. I keep Kosher style and therefore can not have many of the sushi. One of the full meal choices had a tuna avocado. I was not allowed to order the tuna avocado unless I purchased the full meal. Ridiculous.  The only redeeming part of this experience was the manager did not charge us for our meal. In short- subpar food, terrible timing on delivery of the food and complete BS when it came to questions for my waitress.
I was so excited to try Mesa Coyoacan but was really disappointed. The drinks were all right, and so was the guac, but the tacos were boring and the filling was bland and grainy (the chorizo sopes plate in particular was a bummer). There were two of us on a Wednesday night and we ordered several drinks each, plus apps and entrees. We'd meant to make a night of it, and intended to order more drinks and possibly dessert, but our pushy waiter kept trying to hustle us out (he even tried more than once to remove our still-full plates from us).
Small overpriced portions of basically bland food. Was very disappointed and insulted with what they served us. NEVER again, we felt cheated and ripped off.
"Street vendor food is the staple of those looking for a grab and go meal when time constraints are daunting upon one's schedule.  With this in mind, a venture to Veronica's Kitchen was sought after for immediate lunch consumption. I'll focus only on the food and price discussion of Veronica's as their street cart located on Front St. is simply a petite metal apparatus that serves food... The Food... 1/2 BBQ Chicken w/ Candy Yams & String Beans I'll separate the review of each component... BBQ Chicken: There's little denying that the aromatics stemming from the BBQ Chicken will reinforce the notion that Comfortable Southern Cooking is remarkable respected and enjoyed.  Unfortunately, the taste and execution of the BBQ Chicken lacked the potency for which Southern Comfort Food is derived.  At first bite, the BBQ Chicken contained a robust flavor of BBQ Sauce.  Sadly, after the initial penetration of the outer exterior, the flavors and texture began to dissolve.  The layers immediately below the skin did not absorb the BBQ flavor, thus leading to a bland chicken taste.  In addition, the chicken (both white and dark meat) was extremely dry, to the extent that almost none of the flavors were available with each bite.  The textural atrocity of the chicken resembled the consumption of Beef Jerky.  Although high hopes were labeled on the BBQ Chicken, the overall execution and textural flaw of the application produced an unwelcoming consumption experience. Candy Yams: I was a little disheartened at the first consumption.  The candy yams were extremely overcooked, to the point in which the Yams resembled a consistency of Yam Sauce, rather than Yams.  The candy (or sugary taste) used in the application were not evident by any means.  This could be attributed to the consistency of the Yams, for which the liquid texture slighted any ""candy"" taste used in the application.  The Yams did not produce that hearty sweet flavor that's common of such a dish.  Sadly, the lack of sugar tastes derived from the candy aspect of the application further tainted the taste of the Yams. String Beans: Perhaps this was most the applauded aspect of the order, despite being overcooked.  The string beans produced a robust earthy flavor when first consumed.  Although the application was runny and extremely soft, the aromatic flavors derived from the earthy and cleansing notes of the vegetable were evident with every bite.  Consuming Veronica's application of the string beans reminds us of how true steamed vegetables should taste.  There's very little need to apply an additive, such a salt, to this side.  The fresh taste of the application consumes every bit of the palate. Ok...  $7.50 for a experience in one thing.  But could the chicken at least absorb both the flavors and juices used during the cooking process?  Although the remarks from discussions with fellow patrons are mixed, the overall consensus believes that at times, Veronica's Kitchen is a hit or miss.  Perhaps a future return to Veronica's will yield a different result.  Sadly, the first patronage yielded unrewarding results."
Definitely best top 3 pizzas I've ever eaten my life.  Most importantly, I had the BEST COCKTAIL on this planet at this joint. I'll come back from Dallas, TX just to have that bad ass Nutella beverage again.
The chilaquiles are bomb but what really made it next level was the habanero hot sauce.  Everything else looked delicious, the wait time wasn't too long (although the neighborhood is a cute place to walk around and explore), and the service was friendly and timely.  So stop here for brunch, order the chilaquiles, douse it in hot sauce, and drink lots of water. It's worth it.
Walking in, I was immediately impressed with the decor of the restaurant; it was classy and casual at the same time. Because it was lunchtime, I ordered one of the lunch specials: Tonkatsu ramen with Japanese curry on the side. The curry came out first, and it was a nice and simple dish. The ramen was the main course, and it was absolutely fantastic. The pork melted in my mouth, the noodles were perfectly textured, and the broth was delicious and hearty. The cost was around $20, which I consider a more than fair price for such a great meal.
While I was originally writing a bad review at my horrible table, the manager approached me and made amends. I was meeting a friend after work, yes I made a reservation, upon arrival, the hostess gave me a choice of two awful tables and refused to let me sit elsewhere. I started the bad review but once the manager came and offered me the downstairs area, it was all good. spacious table- the food was excellent- we opted for small plates. I highly recommend the tuna tartare small plate! Excellent service. I am only giving 4 stars because I had no idea it had such a young crowd- really noisy! Not sure where one goes when in their 50's and not yet retired and ready for Florida!
"The service was so bad: after 25min of waiting we were then told that our dish took ""a while"" ... in a rude / snobbish tone. Being a terrible waiter ruined a meal. Don't recommend coming here."
Literally the absolute best brunch place if you're comfortable with the slightly high prices I'd recommend the poached eggs with tomatoes and grilled haloami
This truly was the weekend of mediocre restaurants. On Friday my friends & I decided to come here. I mean Korean/Spanish fusion seems like a good idea but only on paper. We were quoted an hour and a half wait, we put our names down & went to Nai for drinks and a few apps. Within 30 minutes our table was ready (yay!). We headed over and were seated about 5 minutes later - apparently the table was almost ready not ready.  They have alcoholic capri sun drinks that have little lights inside which were fun. The cocktails were my favorite part. We were pretty stoked to try this menu, the kimchi paella was calling my name! Breakdown of the experience below. Pros Cocktails - original & inventive. The alcoholic capri suns are fun.  Ambience - it's a cute space, could be a nice date spot Service - they know the menu well are attentive & above all without us asking they removed the crispy chicken from our bill b/c it was obvious we didn't enjoy/eat it. Steak w/feta grits & kale - this was my favorite dish here. It was well balanced.  The Meh Kimchi Paella - the shrimp on this was juicy af but didn't make up for the fact that cabbage, cheese rice together makes a mushy mess. Also it wasn't spicy like I hoped it was mildly sweet.  Cons Crispy Chicken - way too sweet The disappointment I felt
Oh man! I had such high hopes for this place, so maybe today was just a off day? But wow, it was bad!  A group of 8 of us came in at around 11 today for brunch and it was still pretty empty, just us and one other table. We ordered drinks and food, and then waited. Oh boy, did we wait. In fact, it took over an hour for our food to come out. I mean, I get it, we're a big group and it takes time, and really it might not have been such a bad hour if getting refills of our water and coffee hadn't been like pulling teeth but nope! Not our waitress' style, apparently.  When the food finally came out it was a mess. Half of our orders were cold, eggs were overcooked and rock solid, a side of beets turned out to be three small beets and a whole bunch of pickled vegetables (huh?), and they completely forgot one person's order. Seriously, they just didn't make it, and she sat there without food until everyone else was done eating ... and then they brought it out (again, huh?).  The food was bad! The service was terrible! Assuming this isn't the norm, I would expect the staff to be really apologetic--I know I would be if I were their shoes--but they just ... didn't seem to notice?  After all of that, I kind of expected them to at least acknowledge it by comping us something, but they did the opposite. When the bill came we saw they had charged us for refills of their tiny cups of diner coffee and for the meal that they didn't bother to cook when it was ordered. Thankfully they took them off the bill after we complained but jeez, get it together guys!
I tend to write longer reviews. Let me keep this short & simple. While the food may be on the lower end of the price range, skip this place & opt for an Italian joint that (1) does a proper bolognese, and (2) does not come to your table 5+ times to ask if you're done when there is obviously still food on the plate. It came to a point when my 3 friends & I looked at each other in disbelief.  Meh food & rushed/annoying service.
This place is all around trash. It was extremely loud, the food was bland, and the service was mediocre  My family of 4 and I showed up after a Hudson River cruise hoping for some good Italian food. We were seated moderately quickly but proceeded to wait no less than 40 minutes for our food to arrive. The waiter expressed a disregard for our time or appetites.  When the food arrived it was unseasoned and rather small portions. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.
There will be seconds!!  First time eating and drinking at Barn Joo 5pm Saturday evening. They start seating ppl at 5 pm. Early dinner so plenty of empty tables. Standing room in the bar area. Nice size bar area too. Bathrooms are located past the bar. Dim lighting and pop music playing thru a nice sound system. Very pleasant waiter and hostess. Time to tawk/write about food and drinks. I ordered a Cucumber Dill Martini. I was worried about dill being the predominant flavor, BUT not. The muddled cucumber really carries a light dill flavor thru every sip. It's a refreshing cocktails, as many cucumber drinks are. It's not sweet and not bland.  To eat, I was craving sushi rolls and kept eyeing the Fried Tiger. I must say, I was afraid it would be a fried & greasy mess. It was NOT. It is bathed in a thin batter and (deep?) fried. You hardly see the batter on the seaweed. Frying it in the batter kept the seaweed crunchy. The chunks of tuna and salmon rolled inside is meaty and substantial. Eel sauce, soy sauce, and chili mayo each on the side. You can dip and create your own dips. Sliced into 8 pcs. 17 bucks. I have to come back for more of the same. Seconds pls.
I made a reservation for 9 people for lunch a few days in advance. When we arrived, we were told that our seats are out in the back where it's sunny and the temperature reaches 90 degrees, as the A/C was weak and did not help. When reaching out to the waiter, we were told that there's nothing they can do, and the staff behaved in a rude manner and did not want to help us. I am reviewing this place solely on the fact that I was expecting to be told when making the reservation that it's going to be in the back of the restaurant, where there is little A/C and where it's very hot in the summer from the direct sun. Needless to say, we left the restaurant and found a better place just down the street.
Delicious food and the owner was incredibly welcoming! The crispy fried rice was probably the best fried rice I've had.
Really great service and food. Can't wait to visit again and try other selections on the menu. Worth the travel from NJ and the wait!
Dirty and unhygienic restaurant. Wouldn't clear plates for a long time. Unfriendly, incompetent staff. Seafood over cooked. Took forever to get someone to take order and to get bill. Why is this place still in business??
5 stars for impeccable service and food! Top dish recos are ricotta, mushrooms, raw scallops, and the orecchiette, but honestly everything was amazing.
We stopped by to grab a bite before I was going to get a tattoo at Grit and Glory around the corner. First impression is that it's a cute little shop. A large communal table in the center of the restaurant and a nice bar with a wide array of alcohol.  When we sat down I noticed that the table was sticky. But not the kind of sticky that can be wiped up but the sticky that you need to scrub with degreaser and a brush.  I asked for sparkling water and they brought me club soda. Not a big deal but I am very picky so that kinda irked me The waiter was very knowledgeable and gave us ample time as it was our first time. The menu was kinda confusing but after a few minutes we were able to decipher it.  We ordered and after about 20 minutes our food came out. It looked amazing! - looked. The star of my lunch was the fried egg on top of my meatballs. The meatballs were bland and the salad was just wet. I don't know how else to describe it. It was just wet and very bland.  I love sweets so I decided to try their s'mores cookie. I mean seriously? It's a tiny cookie that my puppy could make.  Final note: take it from me just go somewhere else. It looks great but it's not worth it.
My friends and I stumbled into this place. Luckily this place did not disappoint. Great restaurant. Very authentic Malaysian style cuisine, will come back again.
Nice decor. We had a late lunch.  We have been walking around New York for 3 days our legs were tired. Server would not sit us at the comfy table. We thought it was a reasonable request seeing as though it was 2pm and chance of 8 ppl coming in on a Thursday was slim. Lunch food was so so. Recommend the lamb chops. Mussels were not free. Sand which was deep fried chicken and fries. Very basic. Asked for hot sauce to mask the taste. Server was pretty good but wouldn't budge on moving us. We own a restaurant. We do it for our slow times.
The ramen was so unremarkable? I had the classic and a curried one, both were meh experiences. The person I went with and split food with agreed. The appetizers were actually better, which is wild considering their specialty is ramen.  Note: The pork buns were NOT impressive though -- try the other appetizers if you insist on coming.
"I'll start this by saying that I LOVE FOOD. And I get it, we all use Yelp because we love food. I'm the type of person that my friends love eating with because they're like I have never seen anyone enjoy food as much as you. So I saw these great reviews and was like Great!! This is going to be amazing!! I was highly disappointed. Highly.  The decor is great. Super chill and just well put together. I would give it a 5 for that.  The service I would have given a 1 for if it wasn't for a girl named Christine (I believe, I hope I got it right) she was amazing. Super sweet and attentive even though she wasn't our waitress. Our actual waiter came to take our order and we never saw him again. And we never got more water. That's a huge pet peace of mine. At least come by and give me more water. At the least. Please.  Now, the food. I didn't even finish the meal. That's how pointless of a meal it was. I literally said ""Nah, not finishing it, not worth the calories."" I have never counted calories in my life. We got wings and a burger with parm-garlic fries. The burger had no flavor, thank god for bacon and tomatoes. The actual wings were cooked perfectly, so I will give them that. But the sauces were just not good. We got their most popular, chili something and the sweet sriracha. They weren't spicy at all. This is also me comparing the sauces to Buffalo Wild Wings sauces which I love. The fries were drenched in oil and I'm just not a fan of super skinny fries because of this reason. The parm-garlic mixture on top was pretty good but the oil just overpowered the whole meal.  This is a perfect chill by the bar and watch a game kind of place. They should stick to that."
Waited in line for about ten minutes. Love the idea of the cook taking the ticket and making it fresh for you. Trying to get here for the first time via Google maps is difficult. Walk slowly. Ate the cactus, not something I would try again but the rest of the flavors were incredible. Can't wait to come back and try the steak
Pretty good food nice lobster roll plenty of meat and the sweet potato fries were pretty good. I recommend the Connecticut lobster roll
Great place! I've always wanted come to this place because of their high reviews. They didn't make me disappointed! I ordered Bulgogi banh mi with runny egg, vegetable banh mi without egg and banh mi fries. The Bulgogi one was so delicious!! I liked the vegetable one too but I have to add egg next time. The banh mi fries was the best fries ever!!!! I want to try their kimchi fries too! It looks so delicious! I will come here very often from now! Just go and try !!!! Worth it!!
Food and drinks were pretty good, but service was subpar and the place in general seems overhyped. Came at 8pm with a reservation for 2 and they took nearly 20 min to seat us. The hostess stand wasn't manned for the first 10 min we were waiting, and the host seemed confused and incompetent when he finally arrived. The phone rang several times that he just ignored, and I had to remind him several times that we were still waiting for our table.  Once we were seated the service was fine. Our water was pretty frequently refilled and our food came out very promptly. They did completely forget about our drinks though and we had to ask for them several times after our food came out.  The food was good - I had the pad see iew and my friend had the tom yum soup. Both were good, but portions were fairly small.  Overall this place is kind of cool but seems way overhyped for fairly standard Asian fare. There are so many other cute restaurants on the same block, so I probably wouldn't come back if I had other options.
I stopped in during the Bon appetite grub crawl. I can't say I loved the variety of foods here, but it was different. Mediterranean. Lots of olives, oily vegetables, pita and hummus... Nothing really 'hot'.  I did however get to enjoy a pretty informative demonstration on how to prepare/cook a rabbit. That was cool.  Nice dining area though. Airy and open, with clean restrooms.
Great spot for oysters but don't come hungry. Also, dress warm on a breezy night. Sit at the bar if you can.
This place is very calm and great for a date night. Great to have easy conversations and amazing food to pair with. The lobster ravioli tasted delicious... highly recommend. Also had the linguine with clam sauce which was just perfect. The sauce wasn't overwhelming and the pasta was cooked perfectly. For dessert we stuck with Tarufo which didn't have as much nuts as expected but still just as good.     Also, our waiter was very welcoming and accommodating. He had recommended a beer for my husband which turn out to be pretty tasteful for him. So he stuck it with for the rest of the night. I simply had the Cosmo but when it was not tasting right the second time the waiter had no problem fixing the issue which I greatly appreciated.   At the end of the day... if you are looking for good food for a get together or a date night this is the place to be. We will definitely be returning again
The customer service here was appalling. The food was delicious, but it was really a disappointment otherwise. Nobody asked us if we wanted more drinks, it took an hour for our food to arrive, waiters walked by us staring at our empty plates without ever offering to take our them fifteen minutes after we were done. As much as I really wanted to love this place, and the food was super good, I won't be back because of how horribly inattentive their staff is.
Good food but this is the most understaffed restaurant I've been to. There's no one on the floor. I've been waiting 20 minutes and no one has come over to take my order. I've asked twice now too.  They need to hire additional staff members or decrease their amount of tables because what they're doing now is NOT working.
My date and I decided to drop by here for an unplanned Saturday brunch.  The wait staff and service here are pretty good and better than most places I've been.  The wait time was pretty long, but then again the wait is going to be at least 30+ minutes at any decent brunch place during the weekend.  The food was exceptional. I ordered the frittata and it was delicious. It was better than I  expected. My date ordered the baked eggs and bacon. He enjoyed his entree as well.  I would come again but maybe for dinner service. It was a bit crowded and loud so it was hard to talk, but besides the brunch business, my overall experience was good.
What I've Had: Cocktail - Geisha///Food - Pork Sliders, Oba's Chicken Would I go back?: If I was in the area yes Story: Came here for a yelp elite event. Cocktails were good, ambience and decor was inviting and rustic/modern - cool vibe. Food was good. If you're in the area i'd come here for drinks and some bites - nothing to write home about though.
"I went with 3 friends, and we had to wait at least 30 min for a table (which is fine) only to be able to sit down for 25 min total, and be told that we had to leave because they needed the table. Our plates were literally taken as we were just barely finishing our food, and I wasn't even able to finish my drink. The waitress seemed unfazed when we confronted her about this. While the food was good, the wait staff were completely unprofessional, and I don't appreciate being rushed out of a restaurant as if our experience doesn't matter.  We were also told to order everything at the start, and that we couldn't order more food later on, which I also thought was strange. I'm a native New Yorker, and have never been told that, or told that the ""table is needed in 5 minutes"" and to hurry. I don't recommend and am definitely never going back. The restaurant is also expensive enough that we shouldn't have been rushed out, not that it matters. But, you know, if you want to make money, treat your customers with respect."
Stopped here for lunch ... decor is cool.... good service ... food was good... I ordered the turkey burger .. it came with small potatoes.. before my order was brought out , the waitress came to me to say they ran out of the bread for the turkey burger, I thought this was odd being that it was 1 in the afternoon... but she offered to give Me pumpernickel bread instead... I took it .. burger was good .. nice little place to grab a bite
Loved the style, need to work on the substance.   Nomad has tremendous energy, and exceptional service...there are staff hovering over you at all times, which may have led to my record 3 cocktails over dinner.    Beverage menu is dizzingly deep with lots of choices across sweet, savory, and classic. The food, however, was just not memorable.  Portions on the smaller side, our group ended up re-ordering appetizer/entrees after the main course, which felt a little Bond-villainy gluttonous.   - Rigatoni - very nice, rich sauce.  This is the one we ordered twice  - Suckling Pig:  Hugely disappointing, should be tender and juicy.  Tasted more like an over-cooked salmon filet, in all seriousness.
Yesss!!! Finally, great Neapolitan pizza in Sunnyside. This is the real deal: a thin, chewy crust, San Marzano tomatoes, and fresh mozzarella. It's not overly pricey, either. The place just opened so service is a little spotty, but they'll sort it out. A delightful addition to the neighborhood.
I really wanted to give a better review. I wanted to. However after eatting here I was SUPER dissapointed.  I wanted to sit outside but they dont let parties of 4 sit outside. Whatever I will let that go (just posted here so pple are aware)   The lady came over and took our drink order and then forgot about us. 20 min later we called someone over to order.  We then proceeded to order and some of the food came. We were missing food for two people. We gave them time because we figured the carnitas for two might take longer. Then we made the horrible decision to ask.  Apparently the waiter who took our order didnt put  it in. Faced with the decision of finishing the sangria (which was delicious by the way) or leaving to get food somewhere else we decided to wait.  Then the manager helped us and pushed the meal to come faster. When it did, it was sub par but I am not sure that it was because we had a belly full of Sangria.  Getting the check was another mistake. Waitress was no where to be found. 15mins later she came then forgot about us again so we flagged down the manager to process our check. We saw her every minute or so after that passing by the table, Im guessing her bill being paid was important.  Im giving this place 2 stars because the arepas and yuca fries were delicious. When in doubt order the arepas sampler it was the best thing. Sangria was also delicious and the pitcher was not full of ice which was nice.
The Taste of Maine from Luke's Lobster is the perfect option to try if you can't decide on what seafood to get. If includes 1 crab, 1 lobster, and 1 shrimp roll, and comes with chips and a drink. The rolls are crispy and buttery, and the seafood is fresh and perfectly seasoned. My favorite out of the 3 had to be the lobster roll, and they give out generous portions on seafood in their rolls. The service was great, and I loved the nautical theme of the restaurant.
We came for the hainan chicken, and the chicken was good as we expected. We ordered curry puff, seafood soup, garlic vege, and pork intestine. All were nice and tasty. Liked it here!
"Although good, I do not consider the food as memorable. The lure is farm to table which I am all about, however the food was a bit overdressed which did not allow the ""farm fresh"" ingredients to shine. The atmosphere or vibe was dimly lit, sexy but a little noisy, but the roof-top view was insane (good). If you're not staying at the hotel keep your dinner receipt if you want to visit the roof bar without waiting on line outside.  Perhaps if I am in the area again I might give it another attempt. Not sure..."
Just inside Hells Kitchen this was the first restaurant we visited when we hit the ground. Just far enough away from the super uber hustle of Times Square, there begins to be a typical old NYC neighborhood feel in the area. We got there a little early and I'm glad bbecauseby the time we left it was packed and loud. Looks like a great afterwork hang out. The food was tasty and not priced too high. The service was efficient and the surroundings comfortable. Im not sure I would seek it out but if you need a bite or drink, dont hesitate to head over here.
The worse Thai food I hav ever had the most non Thai food we came here after reading reviews and waiting for like 45 min the worse Thai food I havhad even had please done go here if u want authentic Thai food  So sick by the manager she was really mean
Rude staff i made an order on seamless. I called nobody know where my food was, the person who answer the phone gave me attitude and hang up on me. My first call they said food was on the way, half hour after they dont know. Stay away from this unprofessional business
Poor service , poor food and most important extremely poor management or better say NON Existent Manager ... This place Sucks !
Tried to get seated during Sunday brunch service, and while the waiter acknowledged us, the host completely ignored our presence.  Apparently his phone call was much more important.  Ten minutes is my personal limit, and my tummy needed immediate attention, so we left to find another brunch option. This is one of my local go to restaurants, but I will be taking a break for a while. There are just too many excellent restaurants in the area competing for business and actually want my business.
Bookmarked this place as soon as I saw a review from a trusted Yelper 3 months ago, and couldn't wait for my chance to try here. Came in around 5pm on Sunday, was seated at a bar counter without any wait. Server was as friendly as she gets. I asked for sake recommendation she sold me one of her favorite. They have extensive sake list, also five different temperature to choose from, server recommendation is helpful especially if she knows what she is talking about. From the way chopsticks and condiments are laid out on the bar counter, I started expecting a real authentic Japanese food. After I tasted gyoza and tonkotsu ramen, I think taste is designed for not Japanese customers. Food was good, but not that authentic, just different good.  Ambiance is more on modern side, doesn't have that traditional ramen shop feel to it. The best part about my food is egg... Ajitama they served had a really nice flavor to it, I thought about asking for recipe. Since ajitama was so good, I would like to try other food besides tonkotsu ramen next time.
"Tapas portions (which is very disappointing & underwhelming for a ""seafood"" restaurant ), decent taste, but expensive. I would love to rave about this place for numerous reasons, but I cannot be misleading. If you feel for authentic seafood and are nearest Franklin ave, and don't feel like traveling to city Island, Luke's or red lobster near sunrise or gateway, suck it up and pay like you weigh here."
Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. There are no words to describe how awful my experience was here.  We arrived at 7:30pm and were told that the wait would be 1 hour.  We were happy to wait and have a drink.  The restaurant was crowded and the food looked and smelled delicious. 2 hours later there were approximately 5 tables open, with two small groups also waiting.  I asked the host if he would be seating us soon or within the next 30 minutes and he said maybe.  Maybe? 2 hours later.  Eh. Not worth the $30 cab ride there nor was it worth ruining my Saturday night.  We left and went around the corner and got lobster rolls - which were delicious!
The ambiance and food/drinks has made this our go-to Thai place. Not only is the super close to our apt, but the food is great. We've had the green curry, pad see ew, and pad Thai here, all of which were delicious and very flavorful. My favorite drink is their ultimate thai ice tea - if you like thai ice tea, this is the boozy drink for you. With a good amount of alcohol, it isn't cloyingly sweet which I like. The only downside is that there always seems to be a wait. This must be a sign of how popular it is, but even the last time, when we came at 1015 on a Saturday night, there was a 20-30 min wait. And they don't allow reservations during prime weekend hours. But they do have full service at the bar, so you can order from the full menu there, which is a plus.
The chicken & waffles were really good. The chicken was juicy and flavorful. The pecan waffle was fresh & soft, seasoned just right. The butters were amazing.  The bourbon sandwich had to much breading on it and was on the hard dry side. But the shoestring fries were good and plentiful.  The drinks are a bit on the pricey side for brunch, considering those were drink specials. Would come back to try out something different.
Came in for brunch today and was highly disappointed in the service. I was greeted by a woman who took our names as there was a 30min wait. So proceeded to say you have to wait outside. It's raining cats and dogs outside. I asked can we wait by the bar or maybe out in the back. She disgustingly said NO outside in the front.   Totally unprofessional! No way to treat patrons. We left and went to Vivid Cafe which treated us like we were valued! Mangoseed you just lost a customer.
I was super excited to eat at Glasserie, but was left severely underwhelmed after eating here on Sunday. Looking at the other reviews, it might just be that I ordered the wrong things, but there were other problems. In short: - I ordered the radishes and the chicken - the grilled radishes were yummy but pretty basic, the chicken was dull (served in almond milk and cilantro, which sounded really interesting but in reality was just bland). The root veg with the chicken were borderline raw. Don't get me wrong - I like some crunch - but this was closer to raw. - I will say that the tastes I had from my dining mates were more impressive - the lamb tartar was really good, as was the cauliflower - Service was super slow, took a long time to take our order and an age for the food to come out.  I almost gave this place two stars - two bites of my neighbor's lamb tartar salvaged the night
Still upset about how rudely we were treated two weeks when someone in our party of eight joined us after we sat down. This was on a weeknight, just after the restaurant opened and the place was empty. After drinking at the bar for a while, we finally sat down. We ordered food, more drinks, and when the last person arrived the host was so rude. He kept saying she could not join us, he had to leave the last two seats at our table for potential customers. There were nine empty seats in the place the whole time we were there and when a couple came in they were not seated at the two empty seats at the end of our table, nor at the empty seats by the window, but told to wait. I have never been treated so rudely anywhere. I really like the food but I will not be going here again.
The food was great but the service was not good. The server bought mashed potatoes that I did not ask for. Everyone else at the table did. When the server charged me $8 for it I told her I didn't even eat it. It was there. And she said well if they bought it you ordered it. Then when my friend tipped her on her card and put an extra dollar. She only saw the dollar and had to ask infront of everyone why she had to only tip $1. Would never recommend someone to eat there.
Yuca bar was my favorite place the food use to Be amazing but things have changed the food is not the same the octopus & fish was so dry I hope they get back to that great food they once had:(
We ate here on a weekday. Very noisy. Slow service. Food not up to the mark. Not a great value for money.
Lovely place with nice food. Having a reservation for dinner is strongly recommended.
After the recommendation from a friend I decided to give Momosan a shot. We got there a little before 12, luckily we were seated right away, but shortly after we were seated a huge line started to form. If you want to give this place a try be sure to get there early. They had one chicken ramen item on the menu (called Tokyo chicken) so I went with that. My friend informed me that I must try the zuke don (marinated tuna chunks, with scallions, and seaweed). I'm still new to the whole raw fish concept but I have been a fan of the tuna and salmon so far, so I hesitantly agreed. I ordered the lunch set for 16 dollars, it includes your choice of a don and smaller order of the ramen, you can also upgrade it with an additional appetizer for a few extra dollars, but I skipped that since I don't eat pork. They brought out the zuke don first. First impressions: The tuna was presented with chopped scallions over it and underneath it it had nori (seaweed) over white rice. The tuna looked really fresh and I could not wait to take a bite. I am not a fan of seaweed so I took out most of it from the bowl, my friend insisted that this seaweed wasn't as strong (smell of fish) as other places but I didn't want to take the chance.  I took a bite and I was blown away by the taste. I loved it! The tuna was really fresh, there was no fishy smell, it was perfectly marinated (soy sauce?), the scallions enhanced the flavor, I really couldn't get enough of it.... I want more. The ramen was a bit different from what I'm normally used to. I think all the chicken ramen I've had so far they used chicken breast, over here it might have been chicken thigh? Not positive though. I think I probably prefer chicken breast in my ramen. The broth I thought it was on the lighter side, not too oily, not too salty either, but I felt like something was missing. I like my ramen spicy so I emptied half a container of chile oil into the broth and it tasted way better. The noodles were great I thought, well cooked, not chewy, overall good taste. I ended up finishing all of my noodles and broth. Overall a good meal from Momosan. The ramen and zuke don were both good, the zuke don was the clear winner between the two. I would probably go back just for the zuke don.
The New York fries is the best poutine I have had since I left Canada 14 years ago! Would go back again just for this dish! Stopped in for a glass of wine and snack after a broadway show and loved this place! Cool atmosphere, menu looked great and the wine we had was delish!
I had the spicy ramen with fried chicken as a appetizer. The soup tasted so good. It was flavorful and mildly spicy. However, after eating it I got such a bad stomach ache. Couldn't keep anything down. I don't know if that is a pure coincidence but I won't be coming back anytime soon.
I was searching for a spot for my friends and I, came acrosss this and decided to make reservation.  I walked in and expecting friendly staff and good atmosphere but I was completely disappointed. My reservation was 8:45 and I wasn't acknowledged until past 9. The staff was busy running around and was not attentive, I left at 9:45 without a table and still an empty stomach.
As a Japanese, I felt a bit of let down by this place.  I like Yakitori Totto and Totto ramen, but I was disappointed by Soba Totto.  Their name implies soba is what they do, but their soba selection was basic (didn't even have tororo soba) or pricey with Uni on top.  There were many rice bowl options and I saw many ppl having them during lunch time.  When I got my sansai soba, I was surprised the amount of the broth was so little in the smaller bowl.  Soba itself was good, but I really missed having the broth portion I am so used to and enjoy.   The service was sporadic, even after the lunch rush.  I asked for tea and got water, and waited a long time for my change.  It just didn't feel like a restaurant that specializes in soba, as their other totto restaurants do.  Am sure it's a good lunch option in the area though.
Stopped by on a Friday evening at primetime without a reservation and luckily was seated essentially right away. We were quite pleased with the atmosphere and overall decor of the restaurant providing for a very homely italian feel to it. However, we were very not pleased with the the wait time. It took an exceedingly long time to get our food after putting our order in, at least 30/45mins, even just for the appetizer.  The appetizer was absolutely delicious - asparagus wrapped in provolone cheese and prosciutto di parma. I'm not sure I've ever enjoyed prosciutto di parma more than this method.  Ordered off the specials - ravioli stuffed with crab meat. I was slightly disappointed give a) the amount of food (felt like a small meal only 6 raviolis) and b) the amount of oil that they were swimming in (way too much oil in my dish). My girlfriend's entree was much more delicious though, with the oxtail pappardelle - although it was a little too heavy for a single person to eat.
Had a free coupon for ice coffee and cookie, not the best coffee and certainly not worth $3.00 lol .  Just a basic coffee shop!
"What a lovely relaxing time we had here today!  We walked in around 4:00 and just about every seat in the first floor dining room was taken, so we gladly took a pair of seats at the bar. They are right in the middle of the theater district, so as the matinees ended and the hopeful patrons poured in, we soon overhead an increasingly familiar theme of ""do you have reservations?"" We had been walking around all day, and wanted a place to relax, have a beer and an afternoon snack, so the bar was perfect for us. We had a bottle of Saramagal from Spain for $6.50 and a pretty generous Peroni draft for $7.00. We shared a nice antipasto plate of meats and cheeses for $17 -it had salami, prosciutto and ham, olives, mozzarella, parmesan, and marinated peppers. It was terrific- especially the fresh cheeses. It was served with a big basket of crusty bread and fresh butter. We capped off our rest stop with a Cafe Latte ($4) and a Macchiato ($3.50). For around $40, we had an enjoyable hour in a very nice restaurant with a very attentive staff. We could not have been happier with our choice."
Came here prior to a show at Forest Hills stadium on Saturday afternoon. Food was OK. Device wasn't good - waiting 20 mins for a beer and whiskey soda. Apps and food came out at once after 2 tables who can in after us we're served first
Simple, humble, authentic and delicious food. Don't be fooled by the unassuming store front, delightful flavors lie between those walls. There may be a wait for seating as the dining area is small but it's worth the wait. The food is all made fresh to order. The noodles are hand pulled and perfect. We tried the stir fry and soup dishes and they  were both excellent. The dumplings were amazing. Had the fried chicken and veg dumplings and they were packed with fresh flavor, pan fried with no greasiness...I would go back there just for these and eat 2 portions! The staff are friendly and efficient.
Cute and neat little (really little) spot in the financial district! The choice is quite limited but the ramen itself is really tasty. Get also the pork belly buns which are to die for...I just have one warning about this place: they add a 18% tip automatically to your bill for some reason...
"Overwhelmingly disappointed. Run of the mill dumplings, no different than your basic Chinese restaurant. Entree, ""lamb chop"" really shoulder chop. Low on meat, high on price and raw, resulting in difficult to cut and even more difficult to chew. The accompaniment with the chop was a stingy piece of leek that challenged the chop for most indigestible."
"THE GOOD: I love the gastropub atmosphere, and the service and staff were amazing and attentive.  I definitely would recommend as a nice spot to grab a beer with friends.   THE GREAT: Amazing selection of Brewskies! THE ""MEH"": The chicken and waffles made me excited since this is something more-so often found in good soul food places in Harlem (i.e. Sylvias)...the flavor was good, but the chicken served was small, and the waffles were soggy.   The ribs had too much bbq sauce on it for me, I wish they had dry-rub style.   I was really excited for the mac and cheese (as it seemed to be a favorite of many reviewers), but it wasn't GREAT.  I'd rather eat kraft mac and cheese from a box.  After having many good mac and cheese options in the city (nearby), and amazing italian pasta places on staten island...I think it was sub-par.     OVERALL: I'd hang here to drink!"
Chicken and waffles are great as well as apps, beer, and service; but,  I've had better BBQ at mcdonalds. They really need to up their game on that. The brisket tasted like smoked pot roast. No smoke ring just over cooked peppered meat very disappointing.
I like the ambiance and creativity of the restaurant, but I thought the food was pretty overrated. I ordered a falafel salad, and I had a bite of my friend's herb chicken (Thursday special). The falafel salad was a good mix of flavors, but nothing super special especially from a restaurant with a Mediterranean theme. My friend said his herb chicken was good, and the bite I had was enjoyable - I liked the risotto that it came with. The onion on top was a little over the top, but to each their own. We also got a side of the brussels sprouts which was a lot smaller than you'd think given how much it costs. They were also pretty mediocre - I didn't like how small the sprouts were and how they looked like they were thrown messily into a small bowl. Maybe the other entrees are better here - everything I ordered and tried was just overpriced for what they were.
I wanted to love this place, I really did but regrettably The Boil gets only a solid three from me.  This location does not take reservations so be prepared to wait. We waited just over and hour for our table. We came in at 5.45 on a Friday evening and we're seated just before 7.10pm. It's NYC, these things happen right.  I like that you're given rubber gloves and a bib when seated. And trust me, both are needed. Don't be turning up in your glad rags to this establishment, it's all about digging in! So, on to the food. I ordered Ib of shrimp ($15) in Cajun mix at the second spice. This shrimp lacked spice and honestly any real kind of flavour that blew me away. It's was nice but I've had better. I ordered this with corn ($3 for three pieces) which was great, Cajun fries ($5 - more than enough for 2) which were... well just Cajun fries and Mac and Cheese ($6). The mac and cheese wasn't very cheesy and it's difficult to really get stuck in with a flimsy plastic fork. The bread crumb topping was nice though.  This is a no frills establishment. Be prepared for no plates, food served in bags and plastic cutlery. Oh and CASH ONLY.  Will I be back? Maybe. This place is highly rated and I'd love to be able to write one myself one day and if that means coming back to try more food, I'd consider it.
For me these are the best tacos in New York. If you appreciate and recognize a good taco, the prices might seem a little high, but given that no other taco spot in NY is even close to this level, you might want to just accept the premium!
I first heard about Calle Ocho while at Bodega 88 (not an actual bodega but a nice sports bar on Columbus Ave).  The staff told me that Bodega 88 had the same owners as Calle Ocho.  The food was good so when searching for a brunch spot today and Calle Ocho came up, that was the spot. Was not disappointed.  As the name may indicate, it is a Cuban Latino styled restaurant and bar.  At 1:30 PM on a Sunday, the place was full.  However, there is seating at the bar and at small tables in a lounge setting near the bar.  We sat at the bar. They have a very interesting brunch menu and it appears that unlimited sangria is included with a brunch entree.  The place was pretty loud in a good way.   I ordered a Maiz y Camarones which was shrimp with grits in a sauce that the menu calls out manchego cheese, bacon, Peruvian corn and chipotle hollandaise topped with two poached eggs.  Nice. Our order also included the Cachapa con Salmon which was sweet corn pancakes, adobo seared salmon, soft scrambles eggs, cucumber salsa, avocado, pickled onions and lemon caper cream.  Yum. Tropical Sangria was our choice for the drinks. They also served an array of muffins, chocolate chip croissants and breads with a whipped strawberry butter.  The bread (plus some extra) came in handy with the Maiz y Camarones dish as there was a very tasty sauce that was not to be left without dipping. Very good service at our bar seats. The prices were very reasonable for brunch when you consider the quality of the food, sangria being included at no charge, very good service and the nice atmosphere.  Out the door with tax and tip for two people was about $65.  Can't beat that.
The happy hour is an excellent deal at $2 off their awesome house cocktails.  I think it would be a nice date spot.  I came here and caught up with a friend it was a nice noise level so we were actually able to hear each other.  I look forward to going back when it's warm out and take advantage of the patio space.   I only removed a star because we had an overly eager waitress.  We were waiting on a 3rd person before considering food options and she literally kept asking if we were going to order food.  We both ordered 3 rounds of drinks and then promptly left.  That was irritating, but not a deterrent from coming back.
Meh. The only reason I went in here was because we needed a drink near our restaurant before heading away from the area. My sister and I ended up meeting a really nie girl there. Other than that, the place was really underwhelming. I've passed it for years and never gone in. So what's wrong with the place? Yes, it's NYC and things are pricey. This place was charging a decent amount for very small drinks. I was surprised at the sizes. My sister's martini glass looked special-ed. The bartender did not smile once and was short and unfriendly.  Oh, and they're cash only. I never get places like that, especially in NYC when the cabs take credit cards. Don't plan on coming back here.
Finally tried Queens Bully but it failed to live up to the hype and expectations. The stars are only for the service and decor. The food was really underwhelming. The wife and I tried a whole bunch things between the 2 of us and my son had the chicken finger kids meal. We tried the Korean fried wings and the mac n cheese with bacon to start. First off there was nothing Korean about these wings, no flavor and overly sauced. The mac n cheese was just ok, the bacon definitely helped. We ordered the short rib tacos and the full rack of ribs for our entrees. All I can say is do not order the tacos. They are over priced and definitely not worth it. The presentation was nice but it lacked any type of flavor and the ribs did not have any smoke flavor to them. Tasted like ribs cooked in an oven and then covered in store bought BBQ sauce. The chicken fingers were bland and not crispy. Plus there was no sauce for dipping other than ketchup. I really wanted to like this place because the space looked nice and welcoming but the food was not good. Only thing good was the service.
Nice restaurant we ate at on our way to the 9/11 memorial. I had the pulled pork, it was decent considering they aren't a bbq restaurant. The girlfriend had a buffalo chicken wrap. She was in heaven. She was making all sorts of weird noises with every bite. She actually finished her food.
"2 stars to be generous...food was very very overrated. Went in around 730pm on a Thursday. Ordered, a bront. Rib, 1lbs brisket (naked), 6 piece wings, Coleslaw (creamy), Mac and cheese, nd fried corn fritters. The rib nd brisket were room temp at best, dry/over cooked and seemed old. I was very curious how long the meats been sitting. Surprisingly wings, coleslaw, nd fritters were the only decent thing there; Coleslaw especially. I hope they were having a bad day with the smoker, or grill, or whatever but def not worth the price. Giving 2 stars because as disappointing as the ""main"" courses were, the customer service was on point. Very attentive, and courteous staff. They def deserve some recogntion and credit. Wish I could say I'd be willing to try again but not for those prices. Brooklyn has way better smoked bbq spots for half the price."
"Oh my goodness where do I even begin. My friends and I had an 845 reservation which we had made weeks ago because duh trendy place in Brooklyn has weeks worth of waits. We arrive at 850 where the hostess immediately had a terrible attitude telling us we could not be seated because "" guests were enjoying their meal."" We then asked how long it would be and she didn't give us a clear answer and directed us to the bar. My friend then observed two empty tables and inquired if the hostess could put them together to seat us. She nastily responded "" appreciate your input but no.""  We sat down around 915 ( FYI 30 minutes passed our reservation time) at the SAME table we had first recommended to the hostess..yes people they took our idea and made it their own after yelling at us about it. The waitress was just plain rude from the start. We asked if we could have four of the Cacio and Pepe fritelles ( they are good by the way) and she immediately responded ""absolutely not."" I mean was the pasta good, yes the pasta was good but not good enough for this tacky service.  Onto dessert.. We ordered the olive oil cake ( i do recommend it) and chocolate gelato. 30 minutes later no waitress but another waiter said their gelato machine was broken so no gelato for us! We then got the check after having to ask the waiter around us since our waitress was basically avoiding us.And guess what we were charged for the damn gelato!!! Of course we sent the check back but come on seriously! Honestly the service was so beyond brutal I would never recommend anyone comig here. No food is good enough to be treated this way. New York is a big enough place - find somewhere else to go for some good pasta."
Received a gift-card to come here and eat with my wife pre-broadway show. Made a reservation and were seated within minutes; so far so good We sat and were a little overwhelmed at the menu, being it was all family-style and we didn't know how much to order. No problem! The waiter was helpful and patient, and explained the portion sizes and favorites. Penne a la vodka was delicious and generously sized, Riesling was cold and crisp, however the Veal Marsala is my main gripe about this beautiful restaurant. The portion was small (3 small/medium sized pieces, smothered in mushrooms to hide the real size), and was somewhat bland, albeit cooked well. Being it's an italian restaurant, I would hope a stape such as veal marsala would be out of this world, which it sadly wasn't. I was also told the portions were huge, and they really weren't, so if you don't have appetizers I would say everyone should order their own entree and possibly split the sides I'm not crazy about Italian food, and I might consider going back, only if it was another gift LOL. Service was 5 star and place was clean and beautiful.
I was going to watch a play near by and had some time to kill. Decided to come here since there was room at the bar. Sometimes places we find by accident are the best ones.  I got a lychee martinis which was delicious. Since we were short on time we just got two appetizers to share, Vietnamese spring rolls and fried pork belly. Both were really good and I found the portions very generous :) I really like the decor of this restaurant since it's modern, trendy and sexy.  I will make sure you come back because I really want to taste the other stuff in their menu.
I came here for brunch on a rainy day, so there were almost no other customers. Sitting outside on the back patio is a must. It feels like a little garden oasis. Our waiter was French and although he was nice, he wasn't very warm. It took an extremely long time for our food to come out. I didn't check the timing but if I had to guess, I think it was about 25 minutes. It would have been fine if we were there to drink and relax, but there were only 2 other customers and we had somewhere to be.  Once we did receive the food, it was tasty. My friends enjoyed their Steak and Eggs, French Toast with fresh fruit, and create-your-own omelette with gruyere and delicious sautéed mushrooms. Because we were at a French restaurant I went with the Croque Madame and it was very tasty. The egg on top was slightly overcooked, but there was plenty of cheese and I finished the whole thing. The dish that was a miss was the side of Mac N Cheese. It was extremely bland, missing both cheese and salt. If they could just speed up the service, they would gain another star in my book.
"Is this somewhere your cool grandmother - the one who gives off Lily Tomlin in ""Grace & Frankie"" vibes - could live? Absolutely. The aesthetic is elderly hipster chic. Cozy but not trying too hard. Precious but not nauseatingly so. In short, you'll never wanna leave, what with the comfy couches, old magazines, and antique coffee tables.  But (and I hate to burst your bubble), grandma has a nasty streak. Particularly when it comes to cappuccino. For $4.50, you'll be handed a cap the size of your fist. When I remarked on the disparity between coffee and price, I was given a scowl and a rolled eye. Upon further conversation, the proprietor somehow could not fathom why I was dissatisfied with my Keebler elf portion of fresh brew. You'd think, as the owner of Chinatown's answer to Friends' ""Central Perk,"" this dude would know his way around caffeine. And before you ask, no Rachel and Monica weren't there for some much-needed comic relief."
Came here with high expectations and wanted to see what the rave was about. Unfortunately, we were highly disappointed. On the plus side, there are lots of street parking available without a wait on a Sunday afternoon.  Food was dissappointing. I think Jordan Lobster Farm in LI is still my favorite. Started with the New England clam chowder and it was very mediocre at the least. Fried oysters Rockefeller did not have much flavor. The creamed spinach on its own was very underwhelming. Now, the BLT and classic Maine lobster rolls were a let down. BLT has a Cajun mayo which was barely on it. The classic doesn't even barely have a touch of mayo. It's almost nonexistent. The portions of lobster, however, were big but the flavor was just not there. Tasted like it was boiled in water and just threw the pieces on a slab of bread. The fries were over salted, the slaw was disgusting and the potato salad should have been skipped. $90 bill for 2 people for that kind of quality is disappointing.
Overrated and expensive. My drink was half full and $14. Food was mediocre. Hostess was rude and we were sat 20 min after our reservation time. Waitress was nice and the place itself was lovely. Overall just not impressed. Lots of other better places out there.
Came here for a friends birthday, he loves seafood, and said this place is great. Decor is standard for a seafood spot, service was a little slow, but overall staff was great.  Now, as far as the food, I was a little disappointed. I got the lobster meal for $22. Barely any meat in that thing, I was starving after. Yes, it came with a side salad, (which was nice, but seriously a good 4 forkfulls of lettuce) and a side pasta, but the pasta tasted like nothing, like they literally boiled noodles in unseasoned water and threw them on a plate. Took 2 bites, couldn't eat the rest.  My girl ordered the shrimp pasta, came with 6 shrimp which she said were really good, but again, the pasta itself tasted like bland noodles. She at the 6 shrimp and that was it.  All this being said, the garlic bread is excellent. I should have just ate that all night.
What to expect: Long wait times up to 45 mins during weekends dinner times. Courteous and helpful staff. Below Mediocre food. High prices. Being hassled by rude staff and a door man who would stop you from leaving the establishment if you leave too early , presumably just to check if you have paired your dues or not. The Waiting staff would taste your drink to see if your complaints about being served the wrong mix. All in all a crappy experience ------ Ordered Hot Honey Yardbird due to its popularity , and raving reviews by Eater.NY,  If was under seasoned had to ask for some table salt, smelled fishy (could be fried in older oil) the chicken was hardly marinated , however the fried skin was crispy in fact a bit too crispy and gummy at some locations. The white meat was dry and the dark meat portion was juicy. The flavors were lacking the umami punch as well as any trace of heat that I expected from the Hot Honey part of the dish. He chicken it's self was not cleaned up well as one would expect a restaurant of this popularity. There were still some fathers left on the chicken drumett as well as on the thigh skin side, a real turn off. The sweet mash tasted like a wired combination of pumpkin spice, some cinnamon and sweet potatoes kinda tasted like a desert instead a part of an entree. All in all the chef did a lazy job of creating the required flavor combinations. Left the restaurant with out finishing my meal. I am surprised at eater.ny for endorsing a sub par menu item as one of the best places for fried chicken Not on my to go to restaurant list .
The epitome of classic New York City brunch. Everything here is incredibly delicious, yet a bit overpriced. Great for a laid back birthday, brunch with your parents visiting from out of time, or a brunch date. The hummus egg dish is insane, spicy and savory. The egg sandwich is bomb! Try the bloody Mary's very good.
This is probably the best Italian restaurant I have ever been to. The atmosphere is very mellow and welcoming. They have an extensive wine selection and specialty drinks. I ordered the lasagna which was absolutely amazing, and just the right portion. Try their house sparkling water too.
Finally got to try this spot! Everyone talks about the infamous soup dumplings... well at least one person did. We had the beef scallion pancakes, soup dumplings, and fried dumplings. The beef scallion pancakes were A1, I could've easily ate two orders alone. The fried dumplings were so crispy and full of meat. Honestly the soup dumplings were mediocre, I think my expectations were too high, still good though. Overall, great food, chill spot, and affordable prices.
This place does not take reservations and will only seat you if your entire party is here. At first my group was overwhelmed with how many people were on the wait list but we were seated right away because our entire group was there (we were a group of 5!).  They have a large appetizer menu and I wish I could have tried more on it. They had multiple sections and the menu in general had much more selection than their other  location on the West side. We got the pork buns and fries. The seasoning on the fries tasted very similar to Old Bay but I enjoyed it.  I got the Karaka-men which is marketed as the spicy one. It is spicy but if you like spicy foods it won't be as hot as you think it is. Same great flavor as the broth in the other bowls of ramen but with a nice kick. They have three kinds of ramen and also a vegetarian equivalent for each. There was definitely more selection for their appetizers than their ramen.  Overall, I highly recommend and will definitely be back for more.
"Momofuku Ssäm Bar is perfect for a party of 4 or any multiple of 2. First thing first, come early to put your name on the wait list! Our wait time was 2 hours on a Saturday night and we killed it at Strand a few blocks away (they'll text you to notify you ~ 10 min before your table is ready).  I've got to say, Momofuku has one of the MOST spacious dining experiences ever! Now onwards to the important stuff: Sardine On Toast- I can't think of a more perfect starter. I'm not one to enjoy fish skin but I didn't mind it here. The overall composition was light and refreshing from the heart of palm. Perfect palate-opener. Wagyu Beef Tataki- So, I'm pretty much against raw meat. It's finely sliced and very similar in texture to prosciutto. There was no doubt that the beef was fresh but still, I much preferred this dish's radish in marinade. Fried Brussels Sprouts- I think I've finally found the ingredient to make amazeball-brussels sprouts. The fish sauce provided a lovely depth of sweetness. The addition of puffed rice gave this dish an extra level of crunch. The best bits were the loose leaves at the bottom of the bowl, soaked up in liquid goodness. Spicy Pork Sausage & Rice Cakes- You know Tteokbokki? This is that, pan fried, and coated in a   red pepper paste sauce. There wasn't much sausage to the eye and the sauce was overwhelming salty. That aside, I thoroughly enjoyed the tteokbokki itself; it wasn't overly chewy like most places and the pan fried parts were perfection. Gochu Glazed Pork Ribs- The ribs that sat at the top of this dish were SO GOOD. They were so delectably juicy, effortlessly disintegrating, and not too fat. It was like munching on clouds. The ribs at the bottom were much smaller and not as giving. The blue cheese slaw tastes just as you'd imagine it to. To this day, I'm still not sure how it's a worthy pork pairing. Steamed Buns- They're available but not on the menu! They're like Peking duck buns but with pork belly instead. The belly ""blocks"" were darn generous and soft. Each order comes with two and I think everyone should get their own order. In conclusion, if I had something productive to do during the 2-hour wait and haven't found a better place that one ups the steamed buns here... I would come again."
"On my first trip to NYC I of course had to try some pizza. First I had some pizza from 'round da way cause my NYC native honey made me. It was trash... but then I dragged him here due to all the hoopla with Grimaldis and such. With this my impression of NY pizza was redeemed. We had the margherita with pepperoni and garlic in size small... which was way too much pizza but we don't back down from a challenge so we just ate it and regretted it later Ok?! There was a line outside but it only took maybe 10 minutes to be seated on a Friday afternoon. No complaints, except that individual slices or a size smaller than ""small"" (cause it wasn't small) wouldve been greatly appreciated."
Yes! L'Artusi for 200th review, so deserving.  Just one of those rare orgasmic-jaw dropping-drool worthy dining experiences. Brings a tear to my eye just thinking of the perfection that was our dinner there.  House-made ricotta: not always on the official menu but they will bring it to you if you ask. do yourself and favor and PLEASE ASK FOR IT.  Crudos apps: the tartar was refreshing and flavorful.  Pastas: choosing only one (or two!) will be the hardest decision you make this week. the bucatini was out of this world as was a special pasta we went for. zerts: OLIVE OIL CAKE. my god. No room for dessert? Make room dammit!  Wine: If you want a moderately priced bottles, the Annona Montepulciano was stellar.  Lives up to the hype. Actually, L'Artusi surpasses the hype!
Ehhhhhh I was really disappointed. The steak on my nachos was extremely salty. And my enchilada was extremely bland.  I'm confused because this place got really good reviews. Maybe just an off day. I'm not going to try this place again.
TL;DR: So. Good. So so so good. And CHEAP. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Also 50 frozen dumplings for $10.. um yes please. SEATING/AMBIENCE: Place is tiny and I think they recently got some social media hype so now there's more lines.. but trust me, it lives up to the hype. Ambience - super hole in the wall. You can see them make the noodles in the back and the loud slapping may startle you while eating. FOOD: Noodles are perfect - $6-7. Chewy, long, delicious. All of the toppings are so good, my personal favorite is the ox tail. And the dumplings are fire - $3 for 8 or 10 (I can't remember), boiled or panfried are both solid. The wrapping is thin and the meat is juicy and flavorful. **For those of you who aren't familiar with these chinese noodle soups, I want to give fair warning: the broth is pretty nuanced in flavor, and this place does it perfectly. It won't be the smack-in-your-face like Xian Famous Foods or crazy depth like tonkotsu ramen. These noodle soups are meant to be somewhat light, but hearty (kinda like pho or seollongtang, but taste is totally different). But if you're craving more flavor, add some chili oil :) Overall, totally worth it and now I'm hungry and drooling thinking about their noodles.
Stopped by Arrogant Swine for a drink and dessert a week ago. My wife was psyched there was banana cream pie on the menu. The bartender noted it would take 20 minutes, which the two of us took as a good sign. What finally arrived was a dumpy lil pie tin with chemical tasting pudding and cheap whipped cream. The owner/manager came over excitedly asking us how the dessert was. We said its ok. He went on to boast how he got a SWEET DEAL on pre made pie crusts from Sysco, which he just threw pudding in and voila...dessert.  Thanks for that insight buddy. Now we know why all the food here tastes cheap cheap cheap. How much lard do you think the kitchen has on hand to make amazing homemade pie crusts? I'd say a lot. Also with Sysco, you can't just buy pie crusts. You're in for the whole hog. Pun intended.      We had brunch here before and tried the bbq which was underwhelming at best. Again. Now I know why.       Better tell the bald Asian guy to watch what he says to customers, though I'm thankful he blew his hand in one sentence.       Never again. Bummer. It's so close to home.       One more thing. They don't serve Hofbrau (which is listed on their sign) anymore either. Just all American crap like everywhere else.       Yay.
Underwhelmed. Based on the hype and previous reviews, was looking forward to a satisfying meal. We ordered the lettuce salad, wood fired asparagus, and a crab pasta. Lettuce salad had obviously not been properly washed, myself and husband noticed obvious grit and dirt when chewing. Pointed this out to the waiter who exchanged the plate with fluke crudo. Remainder of meal underwhelming, lacking flavor, with the salad being the low point of the meal. With so many great options in the area, not worthy of the hype and cost of the meal.
Love the boil special sauce!!! It's the bomb!!! Lots of garlic and butter. Get it with medium spice and it's even better!! I usually get the shrimp but snow crab legs and clams are good too. The crawfish are not worth it cause of the cost and time to get what little meat there is. If you order any of the combos or 2lbs of any of the same item in the same sauce, it comes with potatoes and corn. The Cajun fries and fried catfish are pretty good as well. They give you bibs and gloves so that you don't get yourself all dirty. Also beware that you and your clothes will smell afterwards. Make sure you bring cash cause they do not accept credit cards. There is an atm machine right in front if you should need one and it charges a $2.50 fee.
This is solid Italian food. Great DUMBO atmosphere. Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and we had to take some of our meal home.
Unfortunately I had to come out of my way and give this place a review because I got food poisoning on my last visit there which was Monday, September 25 I called immediately the next day to speak to management and the young lady who picked up the phone asked me for what, which I find extremely rude they should've just put a manager on the phone but besides the fact I spoke to the manager he gave me an email where he said they'll be able to further handle the issue through that email, I contacted the email and never got a response back so I called the restaurant the following day again I spoke with a manager he took my name and my number and still didn't call me back and it's already the end of the week. I don't always go to this location but I always go to the other blend locations in LIC and never have experienced anything like this! and I've never had an issue like this, this is super unprofessional and they obviously don't care about their customers.. I definitely will not be returning to this location again!
Perfect Thai restaurant for a upscale yet affordable meal. My crew made a reservation 2 weeks ahead. We came for a graduation dinner on a Tuesday evening. There was a limited dinner availability, so we chose a 6 PM time. You are given a 15 minute window to arrive with your whole party and your meal time is limited to 2 hours. We arrived on time and was seated immediately.  Food: A For appetizers we ordered Yum Yai salad (on privileged), Mar Hor (on privileged), and Kao Tang Na Tung (on privileged), and Curry puffs. The Yum Yai salad was my favorite of the appetizers. It had Shrimp, pork, chicken, Chinese sausage, and a delicious hard boiled egg with a runny yolk; delectable. The Mar Hor had a tangy peanut sauce which was paired perfectly with a ripe pineapple. The Kao Tang Na Tung was interesting. It was on a flavorless rice cracker with a tasty crab coconut curry sauce topping. The curry puffs would be my second favorite. The puff was crafted perfectly, crisp and light; soo good! For our main courses we had the Kaeng Run Jun soup (on privileged), spare ribs tamarind, Kaeng Chapoo Phu (on privileged), pineapple shrimp fried rice, and royal pad thai. The Kaeng Run Jun was very spicy but delicious and it contained tender beef. I was told the spare ribs tamarind was also very good. The Kaeng Chapoo Phu was hot as heck (wish I got a mild), as you eat, the heat builds until your tongue is numb and the food starts tasting bitter. Still good though! The real crab meat in the curry was very flavorful and not from a crab meat stick.  Service: A+ Our waiter was super patient and gave us many recommendations. We just trusted him with everything. They continuously checked on us making sure we had everything we needed. They also helped serve the graduation cake.  Decor: A+ Loved their interior design and decor. It gave me a warm, intimate, and welcoming feeling. Fancy Shmancy. For 6 people with alcoholic drinks, the total was under $300 including tips. Loved the overall experience and will be back when I'm in town.
Their Korean fried chicken is an embarrassing hoax. Had a bunch of other stuff and it was all BAD.
If there were 10 star options then....you know. Soco's is easily my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn. The food is great, drinks awesome and atmosphere chill. Can't go wrong with that good ole jambalaya!
It was so disgusting. I ordered KYOTO, which turned out to be my worst ramen experience EVER! It was so oily, way too much pork fat and disgusting unfresh fish smells, one tiny pork belly taste also unfresh too. so disgusting that I only had 2 bites. 16$ for 2 bites! I wrote this review and hoped people would not spend 16$ on this, unfortunate as me.
When a bar kills a pop up restaurant.  I stopped in for a spot of gumbo on the way home. The gumbo was pretty awesome, nearly as good as my friend from NO.  Problem? The bar! A cup of gumbo was listed at $6 on the menu. Sounds fair. Bartender tells me the tax is a $1. Making the total, well you do the math. By my calculation that makes the tax 17.8~ precent. Not including the $1 tip for the bar for service. The sum total after tax and tip? just shy of 36%. Seems a little ridiculous and perhaps even criminal. Currently the tax in nyc is 8.5 not 17.  Too bad because I would like to go with and have a full meal but I am not going to pay a near 18% tax and a 20% tip on top of that for food and service.  I hope they open their own restaurant in Bushwick as I will frequent, however, I will not go back to the bar for the food.
This review is for drinks. Didn't have the food here this time.  Last Wednesday night, a friend and I came here for drinks before dinner at another spot. We tried to order two different draft beers and we were told that there were no draft beers all night.  We then tried to order two cans of beer and were told that they were out of that also. It was not an obscure beer FYI. It was a beer that anyone could go to the corner store and pick up.  At this point, I was wondering if we should just leave since things weren't looking good. It was pretty damn cold outside, so that was the only reason we stayed.  There were good vibes and good music, but is it really that hard to stock some beer at your bar?
Not sure about the hype here. Average brunch at insane prices. Started with a Bloody Mary and had to send it back. It had a perfume type flavor and they knew what we were talking about. I didn't quite catch the name of the ingredient. For food, started with the doughnuts and they were fresh and had yummy toppings but not sure if they were $10 good. Our mains were the burger and salted cod/eggs. Again, just ok. Nothing too stellar or outstanding. My neighbor also ordered the burger and hers looked great. Very tall, meaty, and loaded with veggies. Mine did not. Definitely some quality control issues. We saw our main waiter a total of three times. Thankfully, they have people who refill water and coffee (you're lucky if you get a refill on this one though). All in all about an $80 brunch that was just 'ok'.
Not bad. Have to be a fan of this style of food. Got the basic noodles with chicken and lamb dumplings. Dumplings were solid and noodles were ok.  I would eat here again if there were not a million different options to choose from in NYC. Worth a trip in though. Check it out
"Have just been getting around to some Williamsburg spots, tho I've lived in the neighborhood relatively all my life... which brings me to Pies-n-Thighs! Not going to front... but I'm skeptical of these so-called  ""southern"" ""comfort food"" spots, which I see as nothing more than bland ""gentrified soul food"". That is why I've mainly steered clear of Pies-n-Thighs because everyone is serving up the redundant soul staples of chicken & waffles, biscuits, and mac & cheese but when I saw they had catfish I had to give it a whirl...  So, off to the Southside I went arriving for an early morning weekday breakfast of catfish & grits... Place had a no frills down home décor and wasn't that busy. So, with anticipation I waited for my meal which oddly took a while, but I figured from all the Yelp pic posts it must be worth the wait. When my food finally arrived I was immediately put off by what amounted to two catfish fingers resting on my plate ... not to mention digging into lukewarm grits and a basically cold biscuit!   Everything actually tasted pretty good, despite the long Arsenio finger sized catfish (YouTube when Eddie Murphy was his guest)... but cold food is not cool maaaan!  Nonetheless, the service was good and I dug the neo-soul play list... don't think I'd venture here during peak hours tho, seems like the wait for food would take forever, but maybe the food won't sit long enough to get cold!"
"Super limited menu for those looking for more ""authentic dishes"". A little bit more on the expensive side for standard, cheap Chinese food. Unmemorable."
I went for New Year's Eve so it was probably not the best day to really sample their menu. They had their pre-fixe menu and I think we were the lucky few that was able to get their regular menu before they switched over completely. My boyfriend and I ordered a Margherita Pizza and a Pesto Lasagna. The pesto Lasagna was a bit heavy but it was delicious. I enjoyed it very much.  The Margherita Pizza was disappointing. It tasted like a regular cheese slice. I will not be ordering that again.  Their night garden room looked amazing when I passed by. Unfortunately, we couldn't sit there that night. I will come back another time to try their other things on the menu because it seemed like maybe I just came on the wrong night/ordered the wrong items.
I was really looking forward to this place. So when our plane was late and we missed our reservations, I was bummed out. We made it there a couple days later and had a relaxing meal.  Honestly, Yelp folks disappointed me. This wasn't at all amazing, it was pretty average. Nothing bad, just average. In a city with amazing on nearly every street, why settle for average? So, I wouldn't bother coming here again, I'm still enjoying the amazing restaurants!
We stopped at Junior's after a Broadway show for a late night dessert. The place was so crowded on a Saturday night. We waited about 20 minutes for a table and then once we got a table another 20 minutes for the server to notice us. We ordered our cheesecake and coffee. The cheesecake was creamy and delicious however it wasn't worth the hassle.
"I just left about twenty minutes back. I promise you, and this comes without a grain of unnecessary hyperbole, that Llama Inn brought me the worst dining experience I've ever known in NYC. *First off: Wait TIme* We showed up for our reservation on time. We were told it might be a few minutes before our table was ready, and that we should go and wait by the bar. ""A few minutes"" ended up being about an hour and twenty. While we were waiting, water began to leak from the ceiling on us. I told the hostess and she said ""these are just the kinds of problems that you find in new restaurants."" We should have left then, but alas: we made the mistake of exercising patience. *The Ambience* LOUD. REALLY REALLY LOUD. *The Food* After our hour-plus wait, we were seated and given menus. We made our selections but, when the waitress came by, we were told that almost every item we'd chosen was sold out. Nobody had thought to tell us that any sooner. We found other food and ordered it. It was fine. The ceviche is great, the salads are okay. The drinks are okay, but expensive for what they are. *The Conclusion* After we left, one of my dining companions said ""you couldn't pay me to go back there."" I agree. When all was said and done, this was waste of money and a waste of time. They've got some stuff to figure out, for sure."
I ordered chicken gyro, the chicken smelled like spoiled eggs. I felt sick after I had the sandwich. So disappointed
I was looking on Yelp for a quick dine in dinner, The name Uglyducking caught my eye! When I walked in, sadly, there was no one to seat us, so we sat down our selves. Our waiter came in a few seconds with the menu and recommended the popular dishes. We got the chicken and waffles, and the burger. Both dishes were good and satisfying. I would try the spicy sauce they recommend, it taste just right with the chicken and fries from both dishes. Overall, I will definitly come back again to this place, especially to try there brunch menu.
Don't make the mistake of asking questions about their menu. Waited 45 mins for table and the waitress was such a snippy hipster I literally decided the best decision was to just get up and walk the fuck out
I've been here multiple times and the food is always great! There are a lot of Italian restaurants in the area, but Antonio's is one of the best.  The Eggplant Rollatini is very good, as well as all of their pizzas. For dessert the Nutella Pizza is a must! On top of the delicious food, the service is wonderful. Everyone is friendly and attentive, which makes the dining experience that much better.
My family and I enjoyed a late lunch after visiting the 9/11 Memorial. We sat by the window and enjoyed a delicious blue cheese burger and pulled pork Sandwick. The portions were so large we did not need dinner. Very reasonable prices. OH- and the beer was good and cold. We will he back.
My sis and I have wanted to try this restaurant for so long. The following dishes were ordered: BBQ skewers - not bad. different from the filipino bbq we are used to eating. is there 5 spice in it? Nice buns (2 crispy fried pork belly bao buns) - it wasn't crispy but still tasty Bi-curious Tacos (adobo chicken taco) - i liked the pieces of chicharon on top  Poke me bowl - my sis thought the rice was spoiled at first but it was the flavor of coconut. i liked it. however, would have preferred for the rice not to be hard. Calamansi lemonade - tasted watered down Pancit bowl - nope sorry. it was chopped up noodles (?) and just not what we expected Sinigang bowl - it'll do I don't know if we will be back but we are glad that we tried the food. I am glad that Filipino restaurants are popping up in NYC.
Luke's Lobster is a tiny restaurant that serves the best lobster rolls and other shellfish dishes. If you are claustrophobic you might want to place an order for pick up or dine outside of lunch and dinner hours. Seating is limited and it is a tight squeeze to sit down at one of the two tables or half a dozen stools. A lot of customers ate their food in a designated seating area across the street. My husband and I luckily got a seat in the restaurant.     We both had a lobster roll. It is made with a generous portion of perfectly cooked Maine lobster meat, covered with a light seasoning and drawn butter. I also had a cup of the New England clam chowder. The clams were big and tender with tons of flavor. The entire meal was off the charts!!! Simply fresh and delicious just the way I like it.  The food comes out pretty quickly. Most of the food and beverages are imported from Maine.  I highly recommend Luke's to you lobster lovers!
I've lived in NYC all my life and FINALLY made my way to a Xi'an location. Figuring I had all of the time in the world to visit one of it's bazillion locations in NYC only made me delay that decision to try them even longer. Unfortunately, the lead up to eating here just did not live up to the massive expectations I heard about their amazingly delicious noodles. Maybe it was just that this place is so overly hyped that my expectations were way in the stratosphere. This location is not huge, but there's ample picnic table style seating in the back of this stuffy restaurant. The process is simple - place your order at the cashier and let them know if you're sitting in or not. If you're sitting in, just plop your behind at a seat in the back and they will call out your receipt number. There is NO table service here so get ready to get your behind back up because the food is ready extremely (and questionably) quickly after you order. The fact that you can't see the kitchen or where the food is prepared and having it arrive to the ground level via a food lift/shaft makes it extra sketchy, but I proceeded to eat the food at my own peril anyway. We ordered 2 of the proclaimed most popular items, N1 (Spicy Cumin Lamb Noodles) and B2 (Spicy Cumin Lamb Burger): N1 - SPICY CUMIN LAMB NOODLES The noodles were stuck together and extremely oily. After we were done eating it, there was a pond of oil just sitting on the plate. Some might love getting a clogged artery from the oil, but we aren't 2 of them. The beef was dry and, if it weren't for the oil, basically had no flavor. The dish was also EXTREMELY spicy and if you're not into spicy foods, you can tell them to lower the spice level. B2 - SPICY CUMIN LAMB BURGER The bread was a bit hard, like an arepa, which meant the bread basically had no moisture. The meat was minced and dry as well. The meat was pretty spicy and, unfortunately, this was one item we could not lower the spice level of. Honestly, I don't really understand the explosion of Xi'an. The food quality is really sub-par compared to other Chinese restaurants. But Cudos to the owner for the genius behind their marketing and expanding to areas that other Chinese restaurants would not venture to.
Maybe my expectation was too high. Chicken was a bit dry, too salty. They shouldn't put black pepper to kill the flavor of chicken. Sea urchin was decent, tuna was mediocre.
Good drinks, dry pulled pork, and no fall-off-the-bone ribs here. Bbq beans were the saving grace on, based on other reviews, an apparent off night.
Literally the worst service ever. I've walked out of there twice. It's too bad because the food is good. I waited an hour while they served every other table but ours and asked them to check on our food twice. I've had to get my own silver wear, ask the bar for a drink after asking my waiter four times. The lunchtime waiter must be high. He literally cannot remember a thing.
I used to love coming here for tea/dessert with friends. I always knew it was a little on the pricier end, but the desserts would still be good and the tea would keep on coming. But tell me how I can't get hot water refills for my tiny ass tea pot anymore!?!? I get it, you're a business - you probably don't want people to milk the tea pot for everything it's worth. But if I'm going to be paying upwards of $13 for a pot that barely gives me two full cups, best believe I want more than just one water refill. Oh, and that matcha shaved ice special that also costs $13? It's just a giant bowl of shaved ice. Yes, it comes with matcha sauce, condensed milk, two balls of mochi, and barely a spoon of red beans...but I can get that in Flushing for $7 and it'll probably come with a heap of toppings and won't look like just a large bowl of ice. I'm done with this place.
Love PHO here, and Thai food is also tasty. It was on New York restaurants week, so it is a good place to eat.
Good brunch. Would recommend arriving at 11:45 if you don't want to wait (a line goes from no one to 50 people at 11:50).  The menu is a bit heavy. The only light item is the kale salad, but if you're looking for something that's not quite THAT healthy, but also not a heart attack on a plate, you're out of luck. As someone who doesn't enjoy things that are that fatty in the morning, this is not necessarily my kind of spot.  That being said, the biscuits are GREAT. Ex georgia resident here speaking. The flapjacks are really sweet. The roasted grapefruit is really tasty. The sausage is good. I found the little hash brown that came with my order to be repulsively oily.
I loved CAVA at the beginning of the summer but today was a huge disappointment.  All  of the meatballs were over cooked with one burnt side and the grilled veggies were practically raw.  A very expensive bad lunch.
service: forced. unwelcoming. ambiance: romantic. cozy. menu: delicious. inviting. sat down at 10:12pm on Tuesday. restaurant closes at 11pm. we understand they want to be out but maybe; close sooner to not make guests feel pushed out? we felt very rushed by our server, which came by our table 4 times to ask if we were ready to order only giving us 5 minute intervals in between; AND based on her demeanor she clearly dislikes her job. decor was cute and cozy. food was tasty. we had empanadas, hearts of palm salad and entraña. I am pregnant and REALLY wanted dessert but instead of a dessert menu we got the check at 11:10pm, and were told the kitchen was closed when asked about dessert. a proper restaurant will notify the pastry chef that there is a table that might want dessert so they can stick around for an extra 10-15 minutes after closing; that doesn't seem irrational to me or anyone that is familiar with the restaurant industry.  we had two entrees each; a salad; two glasses of wine and two orders of empanadas in an HOUR... personally experienced was extremely rushed which left a bad taste in my mouth.  I would probably go back; just because the food was really great, but maybe come back with enough time to not feel rushed and have dessert.
Good margs, good guac, solid tacos, great vibe, and killer churros. Would definitely recommend. I had the De Carnita tacos and was pleasantly surprised, they are small but bursting with flavour and a lot more filling than I thought when I first saw them. Only downside was that the chips that came with the guac seemed stale or overdone. I'd give it a 3.5 if I could.
Came here on a whim wandering the neighborhood trying to escape the madness of K-town but still in search of Korean for dinner. This place is cute with a definitely Western vibe, but cozy and romantic. And by cozy I mean you're practically sharing your table with your neighbors. It's quite tight. Service is prompt and they even kindly swing by and let you know when the happy hour is ending. They do have a table BBQ service, which is essentially a bunch of flaming briquettes in a porcelain holder with a tiny skillet on your table. It looked a bit precarious when our neighbors ordered it, and considering how small the table was we opted for other delicacies.  I had the happy hour crispy tofu, which was perfectly puffy and crispy with a nice sweet/heat sauce. And the bulgogi hot stone bowl. The bulgogi was delicious and it's served with an adorable quails egg on top. I wasn't patient enough and didn't let enough of my rice get that nice char in the bottom of the bowl, but it was otherwise as homey and comforting as I wanted on a chilly night. My husband ordered some fried dumplings and pork buns. Although the pork buns are loaded up on a spicy mustard everything looked delicious and the dumplings were crispy and juicy. I think this is a wonderful date night spot, though it doesn't have the same ambiance as maybe some of the other classic K-town joints have - for whatever that's worth. It's a good mishmash of Korean favorites and a few other Asian specialties thrown in - though they randomly had churros on the dessert menu. I would certainly go again for the hot stone bowl.
A pretty good Peruvian place. Found a spot on a Saturday evening with no reservation around 8pm. The staff is very friendly and welcoming.  I don't consider myself an expert of Peruvian cuisine, but I know a little of it. I have to say that the flavors are authentic, the ingredient seem like prime quality but the overall execution of everything I tried was not more than ok!  I had much better Peruvian food in the US. Sorry!
Now called Peaches Crab & .... As I waited for my take out order a customer poked in and asked if there was outside seating. The young girl said no.  But I thought, from a business prospective, why not just sit a table & chairs outside to accommodate them.  The temperature is about 75 degrees and the restaurant is basically empty. Waiting to taste the food but heard it's really good
This place is extremely overrated. The tacos are bland. I had the beef,chicken & pork. The guacamole had no flavor. I had to ask for lemon and salt to try to add flavor. Didn't help. The sauce they provide at the table has no flavor. It's a waste of money to come here. If you have had REAL Mexican food, you will HATE it here. For people who love unseasoned food this is for youuuuuuu
I attended a private dinner at the bottom floor at Jane so not sure if this is reflective of the general dining room.  The basement is a nice cozy place for a large dinner party, we had set menus and a very nice variety.  I had the burrata as a starter and it was absolutely delicious. If I could, I would eat that as just a meal. I actually might come back here just for this appetizer.  My main course was the Arctic Char and it was also delicious especially the cauliflower mousse. It was all paired to perfection with some great wines and overall I really enjoyed the meal.  Wait staff were friendly and were nice enough to explain courses along with recommendations based on preferences. Will definitely be coming back for date night!
Great service & Great Food makes for a 5 star combination. Ordered the steak which came with Kale and Grits(very tasty!!) Truffle mac and cheese , and Kale salad were also tasty. This restaurant gave me TopChef vibes Haa!
"After 3 attempts we finally tried this place.  I must say, always on Saturday brunch time! The restaurant is much bigger than you can imagine when you step in. Inside, there are two large comunal tables, where we were seated. Place cozy but comunal table too narrow so you actually can touch the person roght beside you... Food as good as expected! Portions huge, we saw most of the tables were taking leftovers back home. Knowing that, we ordered: Pickles: tasty and good as expected. Crispy artichoke hearts: good but surpringly super small portion compared to any if the rest of the dishes. Not good value for the money.  Chicken bacon egg and cheese: this guys jnow how to cook ""pornfood""! Crispy chicken on a yummy crispy bread with eggs bacon... oh delicious! Mac&cheese: it is considered a side, but it is huge so could actually be an entree. Will definitely go back!"
The food was great, they are not able to handle GF requests, which is not as readily avail in NYC as it is in CA, go figure! However, they were gracious about asking, were quickly available to serve and food came out quickly and we all loved our orders (btw, the brussel sprouts were a huge hit as an appetizer at our table).  Nice wines, tasty, even though limited, they made good decisions on their choices.  I think the only downside was the very high noise level- the bar is fun, good place to mix it up, but realize that the dining area is not super warm or inviting, and very loud from the bar and the noise from upstairs (not sure if dining or what was up there) but the food area has no modifications to account for the very loud sound level.  Great servers, and service, good food, good wine- nice place, but would not go back due to noise level.
OMG! Absolutely delicious! The lobster roll melted in my mouth. Can't wait to get back to Brooklyn to try the crab and shrimp rolls.
One of my favorite brunch spots in all of the city. Cute location, friendly service, and absolutely delicious food options. Started with the breakfast corn dogs since I'm a sucker for deep fried carnival treats, and these were definitely next level good. Like, I could eat a bucket of them. Moving on to the main course, while I normally prefer savory items at brunch, the vanilla bean french toast (brioche bread, crème brûlée batter, vermont maple syrup) was cooked to perfection and was great to split with my husband. Also got the Benedict Jane (poached eggs, crab and crawfish cakes, spinach, tarragon hollandaise) which was incredible. I've had a ton of eggs benedict at this stage, and these were perfect in every way - flavor, texture, and delicious accompanying home fries on the side. Can't wait to come back!
My first experience here was much better than my most recent visit. Service lacked a bit today. When I was ready to order, needed more water and was ready for the check I had to wait and flag someone over and get their attention. No one ever checked on me, not sure where they all went since it wasn't busy. Food was only okay today as well. The water crescents which were 1/4 of my dish were so undercooked I couldn't chew them. Pretty disappointed in my visit..
Went for dinner over the weekend.  Service was pushy on ordering extras, drinks, etc. My sea bass did not come deboned, but was well cooked. The atmosphere was more that of a bar than a restaurant, complete with soccer on tv. Overall, it was meh. With different expectations, I might not have been so disappointed.
Excellent! Fresh products which is the most important thing to start. Cooked nature. Is not a very posh place but service is top. Can't miss it.
Yakitori 3/5 Overcooked chicken with shiso. Meatballwas average Hitachino was good as it should be Was decent but pricey
**Takes credit cards** ***Long wait if you're more than 2 people*** One of my friends that works in Wall Street recommended me this spot on a typical Saturday's night. I got stoned by this spot. Hard to find at first since the street is dark. Great ambiance (with high ceilings), service, and food. It was packed on a Saturday's night at 7PM EST. I didn't have to wait at all since we were a total of 2(two). If you're in a group more than two people, I recommend making a reservation early in advanced.  Their Sausage and Pepperoni is their best seller. But due to my diet, I'd picked something else. 1)Vodka sauce shrimps penne pasta. 2)Arrabbiata 12'inch round pie (mozzarella, spicy peppers, and mushrooms).  For extras toppings, it's only $2 to $6 (varies on your selections). Why the 4 stars? The shrimp in my dish wasn't seasoned at all. Tasted like it was soaked in water for too long. Otherwise this would've been a 5 stars without a second thought.  After you're done, you can hit the Staten Island ferry to see the city's lights. Pretty romantic for your partner. O_o
Let me start by saying that this place literally hit the spot.  The minute you walk up to their window you meet Luis, who is the proud owner and dope as hell. He spoke to all his customers which I even noticed he has a lot of regulars because he knew a lot of them by name. Soon to know my name, because I will begin to become a regular.  Checking out the menu there are so many delicious options that you don't know what to chose from. We decided to choose almost all of them!  We stuffed our faces with: -Pork Crack-Lins -Cuban Bread & Buttah -This Little Piggy Needs Bread  -The Boss Sandwich -Pick-A-Dillow Bowl  -I'm BROKE Bitch And to drink!  -Cortadito -Cafe con Leche Because dessert is always needed we had tres leche! (A MUST)  I give every dish a five star. If you want amazing cuban food take the time and head over!
Excellent place for a date night! I had the spicy miso bowl, edamame & the Orion draft beer. Everything was literally cooked to perfection. If you get a bowl, order the soy sauce egg over the pouched one. Loved the seating and overall vibe of the restaurant as well.
They just reopened from the fire damage today.  Yay! The brunch menu here serves huge portioned biscuit sandwiches with grits on the side, pancakes larger than the plate topped with fried chicken, omelettes, pickles, fried pickes, and a host of other gargantuan plates of awesomeness.  At dinner time they play old school hip hop and change the menu slightly to include ribs and and a huge turkey leg.  The cocktails are strong, whiskey and beer selection stronger, and the overall vibe is fun. The best brunch on the UWS and a great place to grab a drink and late night feast.
I will be honest going in I didnt expect much. I really thought it would be some tourist trap food. I was surprised at how good it was. We were sat almost immediately without reservations. That's always a plus on a busy holiday weekend Dishes are served family style so there is plenty to feed four or five people. We ordered the chicken with lemon butter and added rigatoni pasta. We opted for a side of broccoli. Everything was just great. The side broccoli tasted like it really came out of an Italian grandmother's kitchen. The chicken with lemon butter was excellent. The sauce was well balanced where it wasn't overpowered with lemon.  Would have gotten five stars except the waiter used some tricky wording which resulted in us paying $7.50 for spring water
If you're in upper west side, you have to come here to break your fast.  I came for brunch on a Monday, and when I met those biscuits, it was love at first bite.   I ordered the biscuits and gravy, but the biscuit with jam sampler looked so tempting too.  They make their biscuits square, which I thought was very unique.  They are so fluffy with great flavor, and with that mouthwatering gravy it is absolutely amazing.  The dish can be monotonous though, so order a side of fresh fruit or bacon or sausage or an egg with it.  I do wish they had an option for one biscuit with gravy and one with their jam samples.   Boyfriend got the croque madame.  Very tasty and generously portioned with a side of crispy potatoes.  Their ketchup is delicious too, house made and sweet and tangy, not quite a barbecue sauce.   Plus, hip ambiance, friendly staff, and excellent music from the 70s to 90s.
Great place with amazing drinks, fun vibe and delicious food, however the service was awful. It took 20 min for someone to come to our table to take our order and bring us water and drinks. Then they forgot about the drinks and messed up our food order. Took another 15 minutes at the end to find our waiter to get the bill. When the bill finally came it was wrong so had to send it back. Ended up just paying cash as to not waste more time with credit card machine.  The place is enjoyable with beautiful decor, but the staff was all over the place and needs to get more organized because bad customer service can unfortunately ruin a great dining experience.
I think one of the best deals for ramen in NYC! *a Morimoto gem* Modern and fairly upscale look, but affordable prices.  Momosan does more than ramen though. They have quite a few appetizers/small plates, including pork buns, tuna, gyoza, etc.  We came here for a late dinner around 9pm and the place was still quite full.  They have a bar with seats, a few long tables to share, and a few booths on the sides. I love their decor and furniture.  They offer 4 types of ramen: tonkotsu, chicken, curry, tsukemen. and each comes in a small ($10) or large ($13).  We opted for the tonkotsu large, but could've gotten the small. This broth is a little too fatty/oily for  my liking, but I liked everything else about it! I'm a fan of the thicker noodles, and it also comes with nori, egg, and veggies. I love that they don't charge extra for all these toppings.  We also got the chashu bap, which they mix in front of you right before serving it. Really yummy although I didn't like it as much as the bf, who devoured it. Flavors blended well and it wasn't too salty or sweet!  Overall, I really liked our meal here and SO glad it's only a few blocks away! hehhh
"I came here on a date Thursday night around 7pm. We were free to sit where we wanted. It was already pretty crowded, with groups of people at tables and others sitting at the bar. There was a party going on in the side room. Music was playing and a black and white movie was playing on the brick wall in the back. I ordered wine and he had ordered a cocktail called the ""peasant something"" (cannot remember the whole name) which was a made with tito's vodka. He stated that the drink had a bit too much lime flavor. We didn't order food but the table next to us had the lamb meatballs which looked good. Definitely a cute little date spot. I have also read that the brunch here is good so I would definitely come back and check that out too."
"The food was fine. But the service was HORRIBLE. As soon as we sat down, the waitress tried to take our order but obviously we weren't ready. She came by again a few minutes later but we still weren't ready. So the owner came over not 5 minutes after we'd sat down and circled his finger as if to say ""let's wrap it up"" and literally said, ""Come on guys, you have to order now."" Are you serious? I recognize turnover is essential to a West Village restaurant, but please. And on the off chance I'm being overly dramatic in this review, I overheard the people at the table next to us getting rushed to pay the check, and they talked to each other about how rude the owner was as well. The waitress came over at the end of our meals to apologize to them and to my table, which makes me think she's used to cleaning up this jerk's messes on a regular basis. The food is fine, and if you're in a hurry to eat then sure--this could be a great place for you. But to be honest there are better places more deserving of your patronage."
I dropped by to grab a drink here. Roger Fritz Spritz was really cool, refreshing yet not too strong. I was impressed by the great service. I could say the lighting and decor inside the place were terrific, facilitating photo shooting :)
Unfortunately they didn't let my service dog into the restaurant so I never got to try the food. This is illegal on their part - just in case those of you with service dogs wondered.
I made a reservation for Saturday brunch and despite arriving just a little late (gotta love weekend subway service), we were both seated right away.  If I were to rate the food all by itself, I'd give this place five stars. It's unfortunately the service that really put me off.  When we got our coffee, I had asked if there was a chance I could get a pinch of cinnamon. To which I was told that there's absolutely no cinnamon in the kitchen. Ok. Then I overheard someone asking for almond milk and she received a similar response.  It was tough to get a servers attention. In fact, we kept trying to flag someone down to order a second round of mimosa's and coffee, with no luck. instead, a server stopped by to give us the check -- that's when we finally had the chance to order. It's worth noting that we never even signaled for the check to begin with.  The food itself was spectacular. Pancakes are amazing, beignets are fantastic and the mimosa's are killer.  Come for the food, just don't expect attentive service.
Love love LOVE the Thai food here, super authentic and delicious! It's a cutesy place with nice interior and the red curry is to die for! Drunken noodles are amazing too! Cold days have got me wanting to come back!
This was our second time here. The first being a surprise for my birthday and now a few years later to celebrate our anniversary! A great tip for all readers is to BOOK AHEAD OF Time. Luckily my wifey booked seats for the indoor patio area. The place was very busy and though it had several seating areas every inch and crevice was filled with crowds.  Much to our dismay, the place has progressively become more of young crowd hangout area. If you're looking for comfy and romantic date spots, avoid this one. The place is VERY loud and tight. The food was at most average with the exception of the gnocchi. The Truffle Gnocchi was most wonderful.  For the nice finish, we asked the waitress for a dessert that had the words Happy Anniversary on it. To our delight it came put perfect.  I'm not sure we would come again but 5 stars on service, 3 stars overall.
"I'll get straight to it: I don't get the hype about the burger!!! It saddens me that I can only give 2 stars here.The sole reason I came here was the famed burger. After weeks of reading articles, I couldn't take it anymore - I was going. There are two burgers on the menu: the Black Label and the Minetta Burger. I thought, there was no way I made all this effort to try something other than the Black Label. The burger is very basic: buns, meat, caramelized onions, those are the only things I remember. Just based on that I should have had reservations, but I held out hope - there has to be a reason for the hype. This may be personal preference but boy I was disappointed. The buns were large and had an ""old"" feeling/taste where it was way too dry. Then once you got passed the buns, the meat was OK and had some nice flavor that was complemented by the sweetness of the onions, but the burger immediately falls apart and lacked any complexity. I would rather have a nice steak, because it honestly did not resemble anything close to what I've come to know as a burger.  Not to exaggerate, but the difference between what I ate and the hype is probably greater, in the case of this burger, than anything I've had in NYC thus far. In short, way too much bread, average meat, no sauce, dry dry dry, ugh.  Everything else here was fine: great setting, old-school, good drinks, huge portions, good service."
While ordering my boyfriend asked if Sprite was available and we were told it was not... so far, not an issue... then a couple of white men walk in, sit down and start to order, and then we overhear them ask for Sprite. They're told that he could bring them some...And sure enough the same person who told us there was no Sprite is seen bringing them Sprite from the store nextdoor! Then to top it off our bill was not handed to us but dictated to us out loud... so needless to say I'm not coming here again...
Canteen style Korean food. Good for simple and quick bites. Most of the things are sold by pound. Has a good number of seats in the back.  Favorites were kimchi fried rice, crab pancake, and beef.
"I have never been treated with such disrespect. The moment my fiancé and I walked in (very nicely dressed, me a suit, her an evening gown, we had just come back from the broadway show 'Chicago'), and asked to be seated, we were ushered to the corner. When I asked the gentleman how long the wait was, he told me to go and sit down without any a mention, almost annoyed I would ask such a thing.  Our initial waitress was extremely rude and insinuated I couldn't read (I am a doctor).  She then proceeded to continue her rude tirade to the point where my fiancé was visibly upset.  The second waiter brought us some popcorn, and then took it away from us with no explanation. When I asked him what was going on, he then went on a rude tirade about how we didn't deserve POPCORN because we didn't make a reservation!  We then ordered our meal, at $230 a plate, no surprise, it is supposed to be a nice place. Even after we ordered we continued to get the cold shoulder from both of the wait staff assigned to our area.  My fiancé was so upset that she would rather leave than stay and be treated like this, so we got up and started to leave. We were then accosted by the staff one last time as I told them,""Your wait staff needs to learn some manners,"" and then some other choice words.  I have lived all over the world, have dined at the finest restaurants and have never been treated like that before.  This is NOT a fine restaurant. The ABSOLUTE WORST in NY."
This place was DELICIOUS. I got the bucket of chicken and my sister got the chicken and waffles (the staple). You need to make reservations in advance, especially if you want to come during the weekend as this place gets PACKED and the wait can be long. I deducted a star because the wait to get the food was around 45 minutes, which is a very long time and probably the reason why the turnover is slow.  They have delicious drinks and their menu is just amazing. The breading of the fried chicken was out of this world. We took the bus here from Union Square which dropped us off a couple blocks away so it is convenient to get to and a New York staple! Make reservations a month or more in advance if you want a specific time. The restaurant itself is pretty small. Can't wait to be back for my fried chicken fix!
One impression of soba-ya is that its very crowded and expensive. Ive been several times and i will still go back though.  My most recent visit I got the hot soba with tempura. And some uni, grated yam appetizer. The uni grated yam appetizer is something i would not order again. The uni was fresh, sweet, creamy and the yam was what you expect yam to be. The taste was good but the texture i do not like. The yam was gooey and foamy added with uni was a tad weird. If you order this, be sure to use soy sauce. Ties the flavors in better, well gives it flavor. The hot soba was good. Came out steaming hot. The soup was very tasty and a tad salty but not in a way thats bothersome. Has a bit of a roasted flavor to it. The noodle was chewy but also soft. Tempura - comes with 3 shrimps, 1 shiso leaf, 1 shishito pepper. The coating was very light and crispy. One bite and the flakes go everywhere. Yum! The shrimp was bouncy. Leaf was crunchy.  Other times  ive been, I've ordered the lunch set. I do not remember much of it except for the dessert, which was really good. I dont remember the name of the dessert, but it was basically  milk pudding with a strawberry (or raspberry, forgot what berry) on top. So good. Very smooth and milky tasting and the tartness of the berry adds a very good flavor. The set came with a small, dainty sized dessert. Ive ordered the full order before and find that i appreciated the small one more. Why? I do not know. Maybe its one of those too much of something good may be bad things... Tl;dr Good, but expensive.
Family visit after Moving images museum. My old kid tried Ragu and liked it. My wife ordered crispy gnocchi and loved it. I ordered carbonara and it was not so good (that's why 3 stars only), I gave my wife to try and she did not like it as well. The service was good, The atmosphere is very nice. We are probably spoiled in ny...  so I would recommend this place but may be ask fir recommendations from the staff.
Food was decent, drinks were STRONG. Make a reservation or you'll have to wait! I made reservations for 6:30, arrived at 6:15 and was seated immediately.  My friend and I each ordered the pho bo as a entree. The two drinks we ordered were the seeking emotion and bruise berry. While the seeking emotion tasted very subtle and not strong, I was hit with Asian glow about 2 sips in. The bruise berry has a stronger flavor and aroma so I wasn't too stoked about that one (my friend gave it high marks though!) As for the pho, being part viet myself I am extremely picky about pho (the broth, meat, veggies, bean sprouts, mint leaves). OBAO exceeded my expectations and I could practically taste the freshness of all the ingredients. I was very happy with the way the dish was prepared and prepped. Although more pricier than the typical mom/pop viet restaurants, you pay for the atmosphere and quality of the food. Lastly, the restaurant was decorated super cute, with hanging lanterns that looked like hot air balloons in Vietnam. I would definitely come back here.
Came here on sat for dinner and wait was about 40 min, they give you a raffle ticket that's easy to lose so dont lose it !!  There are a few chairs and benches outside to sit on.  This restaurant has gotten so popular because of yelp and word of mouth etc, there are peiple from all parts of the world eating here.  You have to split tables with people, if you don't have enough of a ful table, so we ended up at a table with 3 other groups which I hate because it's kind of awkward sometimes.  We ordered xiao long bao, crab xiao long bao, dan dan mian, garlic eggplant, rice cake with beef, and shredded pork with jalapenos and bean curd.  My favorite dishes were the dan dan mian, and the crab xiao long bao. The crab xiao long bao had amazing crab flavor and was so savory and delicious. The dan dan mian was super peanut butter which I love !!! The eggplant was way too sweet, so I only had one piece. The other dishes were not really my taste either because they were too sweet.  Must get the crab xiao long bao!!
I met some friends for dinner here during Restaurant week and had a great time. The restaurant was a lot smaller than I imagined after reading the reviews. I felt a bit cramped sitting so close to other patrons. Our server was real cool and attentive. For starters I had the Grandma Daisy Angel biscuit that had honey roast chicken jus and they were delicious. I had a dipping sauce that reminded me of molasses. For an entree I ordered the fried chicken and waffles and they were very tasty and delicious. One of my greedy friends had ordered the short ribs and after tasting my chicken had ordered some chicken to go. :-) For dessert I ordered the ice cream sandwich that was butter pecan ice-cream with two caramel sweet waffles as the sandwich. I was disappointed in dessert and wished the sandwich portion was a cookie and not another waffle.  My friends enjoyed their meals and drinks. We all had the spiked peach iced tea which was good with not too much alcohol since I am not a big drinker. I would definitely check this spot out again to try some other menu items.
My friends wanted Moroccan, and I'm always down for something new.  The food was good, but I wasn't blown away.  I had the special which was the grilled Porgy with Fries and a side salad.  I didn't eat the fries because I'm trying to be good, though they looked rather standard, the salad was very refreshing.  The fish was very very fresh but they grilled the heck out of it, it had some slight marinade and spice which was ok.  Overall the meal was nice but there was nothing to make me want more.  I like that they let us stay to chit chat after we finished our food.
In a word meh. Squid ink pasta was thin, overlooked and salty. Desert not memorable. Maybe get a pastry chef. Waitress messed our order. Was an ok meal. Food was normal and not mind blowing.  Not worth going back. Maybe I just was expecting more...
The food was just ok and very different from the Chinese food I eat in Cali. I didn't care for the noodles. They were too wide and super long. I don't get that. Maybe there's a trick to eating them. They seemed to be longer than my intestines. Then there was just little bit of beef. Everything was fairly bland. The pork sandwich was a little better but had a lot of fatty meat. And what's up with all the lamb? I didn't realize that was a popular meat in China. Don't get why there's a big deal about the place.
Mmm root & bone! This is the closest you'll get to Yardbird in NYC! (Not as amazing as yardbird Miami but close!) The fried chicken, Mac n cheese, buckwheat cheddar waffles, drunken deviled eggs and biscuits are so delicious. Cocktails are great! And I would recommend saving room for dessert --love the chocolate desserts (Mississippi mud pie!) Really cute space and nice ambience.
My friend and I came here around 6pm on a weekday with reservations and were promptly seated. We each got our own bowl of ramen and had apps to share. We got the Kakuni Bao, which is a braised pork belly. It was tender and had a great flavor to it. We also ordered the Zuke Don, which is a soy marinated tuna over rice. I personally felt it was nothing special and not worth the price tag. In fact, we didn't even finish the dish. As for the ramen.. maybe it was because of all the positive reviews that made me have high expectations, but I felt that it did not compare to a variety of other ramen shops I've tried. Overall, the service was great and was a cozy atmosphere. However, I probably would not return again for the food.
"Cash only, with a tiny small sticker that says ""cash only"", surrounded by ten other stickers so yeah, the message doesn't really comes across. It's almost as if they don't want you to know. PLUS food is mediocre, to say the least. Staff is friendly and they obviously get the oh-shit-I-have-no-cash situation quite a bit, they seem genuinely embarrassed about putting customers through that situation... seems like the problem is at the manager level. tl;dr BAD FOOD, CASH ONLY, NOT CHEAP."
"Second time I came with a few friends after class for one of us to try this place out for the first time. We came at 5 PM on a weekday, just like I did last time, expecting to be able to wait in the bar area until 5:30 PM except we were quite literally thrown out of the restaurant by the workers sitting at the foot of the stairs, telling us that ""the place isn't open till 5:30!!!!!"" I was rather put off by that. We wandered Ktown for a bit, grabbing a snack before heading back to the restaurant a little before 5:30. However, this time there were people waiting in the bar area?? Sure, it was 5:25 PM at that point, but it was still a little bit irritating. We were seated a little after opening time at 5:30, and all got hot soupy things: I the spicy miso ramen, my friend the shrimp tempura udon noodle soup, and our other companion the salmon tea rice. We were all just meh about our foods, the service was slow (we were in a corner but it wasn't a hidden one?? Our waters weren't filled at all during the meal, the only fast part of service was giving our cards/check back to us for signing. Seemed extra touristy this time too, and just as loud. Probably wouldn't come back after this visit, but wouldn't cry and run if a group wanted to come here in the future."
"1/3/17 after a long hiatus, I visited last night and was disappointed at my spice level. I think it is time Sri's gets called out for false advertising. You cannot have a dish listed as spicy and then serve some ""Americanized"" bland version. This is a disgrace to anyone who knows Thai food well. No self respecting Thai food lover would approve the crispy Trout Fillet in Spicy Curry Sauce that was served to me last night. It was not spicy at all and I had to request for the spices on the side to give it a kick. This used to be my favorite Thai restaurant but the inconsistency showed in getting the spice level right is just too much. Coupled with the fact that my favorite server and the only one I trusted to get my order right - the one known as ""Bella"" is no longer there. I might continue going to Glen Cove to get my Thai fix. Still, despite all of that, I did enjoy my Tum Yum soup last night. Seriously, folks please get it together or else you are going to keep losing your regulars."
Delicious Korean food. Highly recommend this spot for authentic Korean and high quality service. Yummy!
I walked into this restaurant around 8:30 a.m for breakfast and asked for a table for four. A hostess brought us all the way to the very back corner table in a small separate room at the back of the restaurant. There were plenty of unoccupied tables we could have been seated on, so it felt odd that she was leading us towards the back while passing by all of those empty tables. So before she set down the menus, I asked her nicely if we can be seated at another table. Then, she ROLLED HER EYE AT US and made sure that we could see her very obviously annoyed face!!!! Right away, I told her that we are leaving, so we walked out.
Amazing margaritas, I usually go with the jalapeno infused cucumber.  The guac is amazing and some of their shrimp dishes are also my favorite.   I think some of their food is overpriced, especially their brunch menu.
Had the red got chili falafel sandwich. Definitely not as spicy as the name world suggest but tasty. I was pleased.
This place is busy and popular so prepare for the average 30mins waiting around dinner time. We tried different sauces and I think they all taste great. The garlic butter sauce is kind of heavy but super delicious. My favorite dish is the soft shell crab. It's crispy outside and juicy inside. Being served with fries, I think that's the only dish there that kind carries the spirit of Cajun food. They other dishes are just boiled seafood topped with sauce lol. I don't recommend oyster here. They are overpriced for the quality.
"I want to clear that my review is strictly on the service. The cheese plate and tapa I had were really good, and I'm sure that everything else is too. I've been meaning to come here for a while and I heard so many good things from several people. I really wanted to have a good experience. But I had a horrible one. I made reservations and came in around 6:30. They open at 5pm and they where barely set up. All the barware, bottles and garnish where still covered with caps and plastic wrap. We set down and the server (one of the French girls) came and told us of the specials, I didn't quite understand how it worked so I asked again. Then she got annoyed and explained it again with an attitude. We decided to move to the bar so we'd have a better experience. My wife asked the bartender (who clearly showed no experience in bartending) if she could make a cocktail with the ingredients of the hot toddy but as a cocktail instead. She simply poured everything in a mug, added water and stirred with a straw. (Wow)... So we said we'd have just some wine instead and ordered a Chardonnay and a rosè. She gave my wife a Cabernet (red). She was then surprised my wife didn't want to drink a cocktail made with water (my wife is a bartender)  Really politely I said that maybe I wasn't clear and that I wanted a Chardonnay. At that point we had just ordered a board of cheese. She gave us our cheese in a clumsy way so the presentation of the cheese just crumbled- all the cheese fell over. She left without letting us know which cheese was which and went to chat with her French coworker. Clearly she didn't assume I didn't speak French otherwise she wouldn't talk badly about her customers in front of the in that language. They discussed in French how we were being "" difficult "" , when really we were being very nice about the whole experience and trying to help her by ordering wine and being polite. At that point I just asked for the check paid and left. I really wanted to like this place and I'm sure the food is great but with a FOH staff like that your business won't be able to sell it. First of all lack of communication, then clearly not enough industry experience, and in top of it bad mouthing people that paid for their awful service."
I had brunch here on Easter Sun. The french toast was delightful and I will be returning soon. The atmosphere is very laid back and contemporary. We enjoyed our meal at the bar with Mike as our bartender.
This place was in the top 100 best places to eat in Williamsburg, which was great because we love trying new Peruvian restaurants, what they didn't include is that when you walk in you have no idea who the host is. Once we got that figured out we were told to wait 10 min even though as we walked in there were tables ready.  No problem, then we headed to the bar, hoping to order something 15 min pass we were still waiting on a table and for the bartenders to attend us. That never happened even when we tried to get their attention. Then a large group came in and they were seated quickly while 3 other parties, including mine are waiting. That's when we decided to leave. Bad service/hosts.
Walking around the area with my date and decided to eat here instead since the place we planned on had 15 groups ahead of us.  We were hungry and ready to eat good food so we came in here. We were lucky because the party that was supposed to be seated did not show. We quickly got seats at the bar. The place is so small and nicely decorated. The kitchen was right next to the bar so you can smell every thing. We ordered the specials which were the french toast and meatball sliders with espresso and iced tea. The food came out quick and we were a bit surprised on how little food was on our plates. There was one slice of french toast and 3 meatball sliders. Sliders I can understand, 3, but one little piece of french toast? Bread is not expensive. French toast tasted good, not too buttery, not too sweet. For me there should be at least 3-4 slices on my plate. Even then it wouldn't have been enough to make a meal.  Meatballs were a disappointment. My date could make the same or better. My father definitely makes better tasting meatballs. The sauce was so so but the buns were freshly baked so they were good. I could eat both of the orders and still not be full or satisfied. Needless to say, we left hungry. Nothing else appealed to us from the menu. The service was good, prices too high for the amount of food, and we walked out smelling like the food.
Uglyduckling is an eclectic mix of food, coupled with an admirable selection of draft beers (~30 in all). After reading a previous review that included a picture of their chicken and waffles, I had to try it out. Came in around 7:45 with no wait! Lara was awesome -- service was very prompt and sincere, something that I am notoriously critical of, considering I also work in the industry.  We ordered the sweet corn and pork belly fritters with a mango jalapeño sauce. While my partner didn't think it was so great, I thought they were decent, especially compared to our main courses, but they could have a bit more seasoning and pork belly. For main courses, we ordered the Steak and Potato dish that came with fries and a steak in a red wine & Jack Daniels reduction. It was tender and had the right balance of sweet and savory.  We also had the chicken and waffles, served with pure maple syrup and a spicy aioli. I LOVED this dish. The chicken was boneless, tender, and seasoned perfectly (which is apparently a secret blend of spices). It was a generous amount of chicken paired with an equally generous waffle. All the flavors were harmoniously brought together by the aioli and the surprisingly light maple syrup. All in all, I would definitely come back to try the poutine and the other main courses. This place is very promising!
"Fake Korean BBQ for white people. Start with the positive.  Its a nice decor.  The quality of the meat is good.  Too good.  The dry aged ribeye is good, but not korean. Interestingly when I asked about the ""wagyu"" and whether it was from japan or from Texas, the waiter told me, somewhat mockingly, that ""Kobe"" was japanese, and ""wagyu"" was US raised. First off, F YOU.  Kobe is like an appellation for beef in Japan.  Miyazaki is a different area for beef.  All Japanese beef is ""wagyu"".  It literally means ""japanese beef"".  ""japanese style beef"" would be ""wagyufu"".   I lived in japan, I speak Japanese, and I have been to Korean a few times. The service was good when you got it, but in attentive mostly. They slice the meat too thickly for the way its cooked.  The kimchee is TERRIBLE.  Its super sour, and as I have said, I have been to Korea many times, so this is not an ""authentic"" thing. then they have these shitty little vacuum things that they pull down which get between you and the person you are with, yet they don't actually suck up much smoke. Purely for looks.  Overall, you are SO much better off just getting in a cab and going to 32.  K town is so much cheaper, better, and more fun."
Just when my faith in fine Italian cooking starts to waver, I remember my sweet Babbo! This establishment is the standard bearer for elevated Italian dining. Babbo features a daring and fulfilling menu that highlights unrivaled pastas (particularly the pasta tasting menu) in warm, carriage-house surroundings.  The pig foot Milanese may perhaps be the worst-sounding, best-tasting entree I think I've ever had! The vibe is definitely energized. Trying to wrestle up a reservation is nearly impossible.  But if you can, Babbo is an experience not to be missed!
The meat was fatty and not well cooked. A very slim selection and highly priced.  At the bar- there are no well known name brands for vodka, whisky or even Sprite or Coke. I felt as if it was watered down.. Not impressed
Pulled pork was amazing! The Irish coffee was tasty as well. The restaurant had a pleasant vibe and I highly recommend this spot for brunch
Was super stoked to come here and arrived early in order to secure a table. The restaurant filled up pretty quickly. We ordered some appetizers: fish cake, tempura, but we were here for the soba noodles. One of us had the soba set while the others had a variation. Duck noodles was one, another was a cold mountain yam and uni soba noodles. I must admit, the soba noodles were really disappointing. Every single one of us got soba that was on the mushy side, even the cold version. I do commend them on the broth though because that was fantastic.  I'm not sure I would wait in line for this. I'm glad we came, but gauging from the texture of the soba, I am not in a rush to return.
I personally don't like the service at this sweet chicks  1. They don't take orders over the phone so that leaves you with the only option to go there order and then wait another 30 minutes  2. While on the phone with them, they don't mention what's actually going on. For example brunch is until 6 so certain items aren't on the menu.  3. The girls there often in a daze or if you inquire about anything it's as if you're bothering them ... like it's not their job. The other sweet chick locations have more of a homie vibe, welcoming and pleasant staff. Even when they are busy they are accommodating. Having a location near park slope the staff needs to be more pleasant considering it's a kids friendly neighborhood. The food is consistent with the other locations but this is my second time here with terrible service so from now on I think I'd rather take the trip to Williamsburg. To flourish at this location they need a lot of improvement and I think they are only tainting the reputation of sweet chicks, unfortunately.
What a difference from a year ago! This time the food took even longer than last time, but it was not worth the wait.  I ordered a plain chicken arepa and what I got was an arepa with salsa rosada (pink sauce, which is a nicer way of saying ketchup and mayo mix) drenched chicken on top. My wife ordered a calentado and the rice and beans where cold and way too salty. At this point I had waited too long to wait again for them to make my food right, so my wife shared her salty cold rice with me, but I let the waitress know anyway. She told me they were making a new chicken arepa for me to take with me free of charge, which was very nice of them, but I would rather have had it right the first time or not have been charged for it.
Everyone is talking about this place's burger: twice I have come for the burger, twice I have left without a burger.  Both times I put my name down at Emily the hostess informed me they still had the burger and the wait time was about an hour. They don't let patrons wait at the bar before being seated, so I went to a bar next door until I received a text it was time to come back. When I was finally seated, the waitress informed the hostess they were out of the burger, so I left. The second time I was seated, the waitress said there was one burger left and she would put the order in right away. She didn't even make it to the kitchen before she came back and told me they were out of the burger, again. I left.  A pizza joint famous for their burger doesn't make sense in the first place, but how can you run out of the menu item EVERYONE is talking about?   Not only was the wait time over an hour and I had nothing to eat, I had to stand in line outside in the rain to put my name down with the waitress in the first place.  This place is a complete joke.
If you're hungry and looking for quick service, do not come to this place. Let me start by saying that we waited about 15 mins to be seated, even though there were plenty of tables available, just because waitresses were too busy to clean them up after other customers had left. Once we're seated, we wait another 10 mins to get our menus. We finally order, our drinks take a while to come. My boyfriend was done with his drink by the time they brought out our food. He ordered another mimosa (quickest drink to make), we finished our meal and they STILL hadn't brought out his mimosa. They completely forgot about it and we thought it would be pointless to even remind the waitress. We just asked for the check instead. It's almost impossible to get a waitress' attention at this place. They've really got to get their stuff together. Food was alright, definitely didn't make up for the slow and bad service.
Finding delicious authentic Mexican in NYC is rare. We ain't no west coast. Let's be honest, however the tacos here are just like what I remember in Rosarito, Mexico. And it's affordable. Help yourself to delicious fresh Pico de gallo was another plus. Even my picky son liked the food here. He says dad we can go here every time we are in NYC. Yummy
I haven't been to this restaurant in a while because the food wasn't as good as I remembered years ago but to my surprise, this morning my food was cooked to perfection. It was so good i informed the manager who allowed me To go to the kitchen to compliment the chefs. I will definitely be returning.  AGAIN, COMPLIMENTS TO THE CHEFS FOR A MEAL WELL PREPARED.
I just happened to be at UWS area 1 day so I decided to give this place a try - since my friends have been raving about this place for a while. So here goes the review: 5 stars for food quality and generous gigantic portion. Love love love the pickle appetizer (jalapeno pickes) AND especially the fried chicken with sausage gravy! The only downside is the place is ALWAYS packed (especially weekends), and it can be tough to find seating even at the bar (I need to wait 20 plus minutes for it). Wait time for table is also ridiculous -- could be more than 1 hour!! I think the most logical way to avoid the wait time is to get reservation, which can only be done for a part of 6 people minimum. Regardless of how busy the place is, I've finally found 1 of the go to spots at UWS! Thanks to my friend who recommended this place!
I feel like I've had JWF bookmarked for awhile and never got around to actually coming in. Met up with my friend for a late lunch and came into a full house! Thankfully, we only had to wait for a few minutes and were seated not too long after I arrived.  Service was spot on. Our waiter was very attentive and was just a nice guy, overall. He gave his opinion when we asked for his input on a few menu items, as well. I went with the Madame Freda sandwich and my best friend ordered Jack's Breakfast. We also decided to throw our discipline out of the window for the day and ordered a side of French fries and a side of duck bacon to share. Food rolled out fairly quickly and we ordered a carafe of wine to accompany our meal. My sandwich was so yummy with each bite being filled with prosciutto, cheese egg and a toasted (and not overly soggy) bread. I wish my yolk was a little runny though - that is my only ask!  As for the French fries, they were fried perfectly and had a nice crunch to them. Dunked them into the tomatillo sauce they provided to add some more flavor. The duck bacon's flavor was awesome but I feel like it was a little on the cold side. That didn't stop us from inhaling it, though!  As for my friend's meal, his eggs were perfectly runny and his steak was cooked well. Tasted good too, for the bite I had. Put on some tomatillo and steak sauce for extra flavor! It came with fingerling potatoes that we thought were sausages for a second hahaha. In true breakfast fashion, he dunked his sourdough toast into the yolks of his sunny side up eggs. I was a little jealous of his runny eggs  Overall, great experience! Ended up spending around $50 each l, including tip, but that's because we ordered sides and a carafe of wine. You can easily spend below $20 here, for those care. Great place to stop by if you're in the SoHo area.
Got fooled by the yelp review ... very disappointed with their food quality :( was excited to order sushi n the rice was off n not even worth the price
First time here for brunch a few days ago. I would say EH. I ordered the baked truffle eggs with polenta and mushrooms. Perhaps it was sitting out for a while, but it wasn't piping hot and I didn't get much of the polenta at all. My friends ordered the pizza and another egg dish (eggs in purgatory). Service (for water and coffee) was a bit lackluster. The restaurant had a nice vibe/atmosphere and on this given day, it was getting packed or close to it. I would return to check it out again.
"If you blink, you will cruise by this place in a mix of industrial spaces and sprouting hipster joints. If you end up at their takeout counter, considering it has the signage the original eatery lacks, just back up a door or two. It is in a real dump. Not that it is unclean, just a dump.  Their pizza is something unique. Very light, fresh quality ingredients, and very good to excellent. The 12"" original was delish. 15 bucks.  If you don't mind the dumpy digs and you wanna try a good pizza, enjoy."
"I'm a sucker for a good lobster or crab roll, and this place was sooooo good.  Dropped in and tried ""a taste of Maine"" - half each of lobster, crab and shrimp rolls with two crab claws.  The claws were chilled a bit too much which killed their flavor, but oh boy...that crab roll was buttery wonderful and so good it stole the show.  They should name this place Luke's Crab Rolls. Not that the lobster and shrimp rolls were bad.  Lobster came in a close second, with some big meaty chunks nested in that fluffy buttery bread.  It's quite flavorful and exactly what you'd expect (unless you are a snobby new englander).  And finally the shrimp - the fishiest of the 3, it's those little cocktail shrimp that have the really intense flavor and I generally associate with stomach aches and bad Chinese food.  Seriously though, it's good if you dig that kind of shrimp :) Finally, I don't normally discuss soda but they had some tasty craft choices in their fridge.  Definitely recommend the blueberry soda -  where else are you gonna get one?   My only gripe is the price -  good seafood don't come cheap.  And this is Wall Street after all...$20 bucks for a sandwich, yeah...totally normal..."
The hostess gave us a ton of lip because one of our guests went to go grab cash. The restaurant was empty.... Also pretty average ramen And to top it off no to go boxes
As of now 小籠包 here is the best in NYC. Dan Dan Noodle is also great!
We came here on a Wednesday night around 8pm and got seated after 5-10min. We ordered the Khao Soi, Duck Salad and Shrimp & Squid with Salted Egg Yolk. They were all excellent but the Khao Soi was a real standout. 3 dishes was perfect for 2 people.  They don't mess around with the peppers, and I was tearing about 15 minutes in! The Khao Soi packed a punch but it was the duck salad that was a suicide mission with little pepper seeds that had a delayed effect. Overall excellent meal and service! We will be back for more spicy adventures!
First of all I don't know if this guy was the manager or owner but he was extremely rude. My family and I walked in and he didn't even greet us but looked at us l with a stink mean face. He came off extremely racist. They rushed us out as we are eating.The food was horrible, worst brunch I ever had. Never again will I come back here.
Terrible experience for an oyster bar. Every oyster had pieces of shell in it. Also over priced.
Cute place. It's definitely got this cafe style to it when you first walk in. I got seated within minutes of arriving. The service was very attentive. However, it was a little pushy or rushed. Usually the bill doesn't come until you've asked for it, but they just give it to you before you're even done.  At the end of the meal, my sibling decided to have to soondubu to go. The waitress didn't scope the ingredients out. She just poured the liquid and dumped the whole thing into the little quart. Mind you my sibling was only inches from that. The waitress could've been a little more considerate and done a better job. The liquid was splashing everywhere.  The food: - Scallion seafood pancake - it was okay. Like any other seafood pancake, it was nothing special.  - Beef soondubu - really oily for some odd reason. It was more chilly oil than I thought. I didn't taste that hot pepper flavor like I would from other Korean restaurants.  - Chicken Kimchi fried rice - this was a eye opener for me. My first time having it. I thought it was something amazing, but it's not. The presentation was new to me that was about it. All show and no tell. I got it with cheese and egg. The waitress poured and scrambled the whole thing. I thought I got to do that. I was wrong. It didn't taste like much besides just spicy. I didn't taste much chicken either.  In the end I drank a lot of water. I guess they either used msg or a lot of salt.
Pay attention to your bill.  This place does their suggested tips AFTER tax so beware! Service here was pretty much a miss.  It was pretty bad actually.  Service was not friendly at all.  I had to ask several times for certain things, and was told more than once to wait.  They also never came back after telling me to wait.   Tonkotsu Ramen - the ramen was very al dente. The bowl looked like it was sitting there when it came out. The broth wasn't steaming and my bowl was not hot at all.  The only good thing about the ramen was the egg since it was nice and runny.  The egg tasted fresh.  The pork was tender and soft but not melt in mouth since it had bite to it.  The pork was okay. Definitely not the worst or the best I've had.  The noodles itself was extremely bland and tasted like spaghetti.  I didn't care for it all.  The broth itself was not hot or steaming. It felt more like room temperature and just sitting in a big pot all day waiting to be scooped out into a bowl.  It was also bland and tasteless.  The ramen was okay.  I would avoid ordering ramen here. Gyu and unagi don - The rice dish was okay, but not the best I've had.  The beef was really dry and tasted old. You could it was precooked and just sitting there, waiting to be reheated and served.  The texture and taste tasted like the way cold cheesesteak would taste.  The eel was good and fatty.  This dish was much better than ramen, but it was crazy expensive for something not so good.   Karaage - It was 20% off during HH.  It tasted okay, but wasn't made the typical way. The pieces were big and it came with a nice sauce.  Overall, this was the best thing out of the three things I ordered.   I couldn't tell if the people working here were Japanese or if this is an authentic Japanese restaurant.  I want to say no since the workers didn't sound like they were speaking Japanese. I won't be back.  There's so much better out there to try.
My spouse ordered the Fried Chicken Sandwich and, when the dish arrived at the table what was presented was a burnt piece of chicken. The chicken was literally brown. Of all the things to get wrong and I can't believe the chef let that go to a table!!! For this reason it's not possible to give the restaurant rating.
It's a small space and has limited outdoor seating. The service was great and so was the food. Me and my two girlfriends ordered the avocado & asparagus tartine, shrimp & manchego tartine, bianca pizzetta, beef sliders, hand cut fries, creme brulee cheesecake and the caramelized apple tart.  All the food were served on wooden cutting boards besides the dessert. The tartines were pretty good, would've been easier to eat if they came pre-cut. They also come with a side of mixed green salad. The shrimp on the shrimp & manchego tartine still had the tails on it, would've been better if they came removed. The bianca pizzetta was yummy, it came with some seedless grapes which balanced the goat cheese. The beef sliders could've been better, I ordered them medium rare and then came out almost well done. The sliders come with fries. The hand cut fries were good, crispy and not too salty. The creme brulee cheesecake was really good and so was the caramelized apple tart. The pasty part of the tart was nice and fluffy but could've been a bit more crispy. The apples were well cooked and soft. Neither of the desserts were overwhelmingly sweet which was great. Overall, we all enjoyed the food and the quiet atmosphere. We definitely would come back!
I want to give it 2 stars but it's hard for me to do that.  First I wanted a solid  30 min to get a seat for 4. Mean while I saw plenty of empty tables. Most likely could fit  another 20 people easy (this place is huge). I guess they didn't ha e enough workers and didn't want to slam the kitchen. The wait wasn't and issue for me... just everything else was.  Has a slight tacky feeling to me. Large space with a pond to drive people in. Visually appealing at first but when you look into the details it's not great. The table they gave us was slightly dirty. I ordered a drink that was meant to be on the sour side. It was just to sweet. Took a few sips and I didn't like it. No one on my table likes it to. So I placed it on far on the edge of the table ( the table they gave us was huge). That should be a sign for the waiter to possible ask if there's something wrong with the drink. I don't like asked to take back my food or drink because of a issue. I rather wait to see if anything is done and if its not done then I understand the mind set the restaurant is in.  Food was subpar, service was slow and not attentive. The little things is what really makes and experience stand out. I would never come back here again.  End of story.  Never mind... for me to say I would never come back here... I think I'll make it 2 Stars then.
"Chose this place to meet with a friend who I hadn't seen in a very long time.  Had a 5:45 reso.  When we checked in, the hostess told us they needed the table back by 7 because they had a large party coming in.  As someone who has worked many years in the restaurant business (as a waitress and as a hostess), I know that the average time allotted to a party of 2 is typically 1.5-2 hours.  From that point on, everything about our service was rushed.  Immediately after our dessert was dropped off at the table, the check arrived.  We weren't even asked if there was anything else we wanted.  Perhaps we wanted another drink?  It was as if the larger party deserved their business more than ours.  Finally, as we're paying, the manager came over to the table and told us we needed to move to accommodate the party that was arriving.  We would have appreciated it if someone called us in advance of our reso to let us know about the situation.  Had that been, we would have gone somewhere else and came back another time.   Wait, there's more... Because I put more emphasis on an establishment's food and not its service, I returned this afternoon for a salad (and had it to-go).  The salad dressing, a ""creamy italian"" was broken/separated!!! Gross.  I knew I shouldn't have eaten it but I was so hungry. Needless to say my stomach is not doing well right now (and it's only going to go downhill from here).  Not something I'd expect from a fine dining establishment. Here's a tip my fiance (also a chef) learned from a Michelin star chef: use water. You're welcome."
"Does NOT travel well This was my first trip to Luke's Lobster and probably my last. My experience was much better than the actual Lobster Roll.  The restaurant is quite small, but very adorable. The decor is very ""ship-ie."" The cashier was very polite and helpful, but this is where my gushing ends.  I ordered the Trio (1/3 lobster roll, 1/3 shrimp roll, 1/3 crab roll) but requested that the shrimp roll be replaced with another lobster roll. When I got back to my hotel room (hungry and ready to chow down) I discover that they gave me three Lobster rolls. (*insert gasp) I guess I don't get to taste the crab roll.  Also, the rolls don't travel well, so eat them right there. The bun is warm and buttery and wonderful, but the lobster is ICE COLD, so what you get is a luke warm bun with a buttery film on your tongue.  I see the potential, but something didn't quite work."
"really don't get the hype maybe we waited too long, and now it's a different chef? no idea not a single memorable dish here the only good part was the flat waterfront view with the crane, and sunset - made me think i was back in Thailand... (yes, i've been there, so please don't try the ""oh well, this is authentic, you wouldn't understand it, and go back to eating your pad thai, nonsense"") papaya salad had a decent spice boar was ok fried fish of the day was ok, sauces were quite good as we were leaving there was this horrendous stench i turned around and realized someone had gotten the fish sauce wings! won't be returning"
"Went here recently for lunch.  I had the $40 sea bass and two club sodas.  I was told the sea bass would be grilled simply with a touch of olive oil.  My plate came out and it looked like someone had spilled water on it.  It was a mess and completely unappetizing. While it was cooked properly, it didnt taste much better than it looked.  Even the capers were bland.  Remember those two clubs sodas?  yeah they were $5 each.  If you're going to have a $70 piece of fish on the menu & if you're going to charge $40 for a lame piece of sea bass, you dont have to take advantage on the 8 oz of club soda.... On the flip side, the staff was very friendly and attentive despite this being a ""no tipping"" restaurant.  Short version: given the cost of this lunch, it's absolutely a 1 star."
"I used to love this place but now I hate it.  After an art gallery show nearby a few months back, I stumbled upon it and had some good food.  I even sent many people and went back a few times.  But since then I called once just before 4pm on a Saturday afternoon and asked if they were opened, and the person who answered the phone said yes we open at 4pm.  So I traveled there with my hungry family and got there at 4:20pm and was told they are ""open"" but not serving dinner until 5pm.  IF you are a restaurant and you are not serving food do not say you are ""open.""  So I went to Kavala Estiatorio nearby and had a great meal...where being open means serving food. Then this morning, I decided to treat my family to a nice breakfast of pancakes at LIC Market since I was in the neighborhood and enjoyed their pancakes at a previous brunch. Again, I checked yelp to confirm they were open on a weekday for breakfast and indeed they are.  But when I got there with my kids who were looking forward to the pancakes I raved about - I was given a very limited breakfast menu with NO pancakes on it.  I asked what's up and got excuses about a small kitchen and there being some ""fine print"" on the website that pancakes are a ""brunch"" only item.  But excuse me, I think pancakes are a breakfast staple and I make them on a 8"" griddle at home so I can't see how space is an issue.  And why is it my job to comb through the fine print on their website to make sure they are serving a basic item before I bring my kids there. The fact is that the food was good at this place, when they would serve it.  But the staff and management is too precious.  Instead of trying to accommodate a couple of kids who would of loved some pancakes they blew us off.  I will never go back and I imagine that attitude will only lead to disappointment eventually for other patrons as well.   And another thing, ""No. I do not want to sit out in your shitty little deck under microwave heat lamps."" Give that a rest and focus on hospitality and accommodations."
Menu had a lot more variety than I expected, and everything looked good. Shrimp skewers were great! The tin roof is neat, and you have a good view of the church across the street (maybe not for long, given the construction on the next block).
"The food here is good, and the baked goods are always fresh. However, it's nothing that special for Brooklyn - there are dozens of restaurants that serve the same fare - and the service was horrific. I had to get up multiple times to ask for basic things like salt and pepper or a refill on their ""bottomless"" coffee (or did they just mean less coffee?). The waitstaff was inattentive and ineffective. The first time a customer gets up to have to find someone to help them, you should make sure you monitor their table and get them exactly what they need. The second time they get up, you should be ashamed and apologizing. The fact that it took several prompts, no apology or apparent acknowledgement of the poor service, made the entire table feel really neglected and the mood changed for our party. There are too many good places in the area that are great alternatives to have to deal with bad service."
The cafe was cute and I liked the concept of the menu items. However, I found the food to be quite bland. My friend and I arrived on a Friday for lunch. There were only three other tables occupied. Only one waiter who doubled as the cashier.  We ordered the Mansour plate [$26.99], which is a sampler plate of kimchi fried rice w/ fried egg, rice and curry, donkatsu, hambagu steak w/ mashed potato, and side of salad and pickles. The kimchi fried rice was bland - just tasted like rice with a little bit of kimchi. The curry over rice looked like it had been sitting out for a while. The donkatsu was soggy and soft. The hambagu steak was tough and tasteless.  The portion is quite big for two girls, but we ended up leaving 60% of the Mansour plate because it wasn't that good, and I went home hungry. Perhaps the drinks and desserts are good? But if four of their dishes are this disappointing, then I have low expectations for the rest of their food.
I was so amazed with my recent visit at Atrium Dumbo, I have tried their Cobb salad with lobster and it was pretty awesome and Vanilla Panna Cotta was super phenomenal. I would definitely be back for more.
If you're looking for a place that has unlimited food and drinks for a weekend brunch, this is the place!!  I've come here a few times with friends and it's always a great time and food and alcohol is constantly flowing!    Not only that the atmosphere is great and sometimes there's live music!  Definitely a go to spot for my friends and I!
This place is really cool! Authentic Cuban - no way. But the food is great and atmosphere very hip and comfortable. Also child friendly, which was a plus since we went with our 2 kids. Only frozen drinks they had when we went were frozen margaritas. Not what we would have ordered otherwise, but they were very good. Popular place around 6pm on a Wednesday, so I can imagine it gets packed during prime hours. But I think it's worth it. The shrimp taco plato is everything!
This is my second time I ordered from them.  -First time, I ordered the break room fries. I asked for an egg and no jalapeños. In the end I got there jalapeños but no egg that I paid extra for. That's not the worst.  This time, let me start by saying the food was good. I had a fish taco and a  pork belly taco. HOWEVER, I found a long speck of dust, and a piece of HAIR in each taco. (see pic) Absolutely gross. Well, sadly this will be the end of break room for me :(
Honestly, everything was just smothered in cheese and bacon and all kinds of fried stuff --- so there's no way anything could have tasted bad (hence the 4 stars) We got the Breakroom burger (includes an onion ring, pork belly, fried egg, and something else fried I think), 3 tacos (the fish tacos are my favorite), and the breakroom fries (includes fries, tater tots, cheese, bacon, and sauce).  Everything was good but it's hard to differentiate flavors when there's so much stuff piled on. My only complaint was that the burger was cooked pretty well instead of medium.  After eating, I felt like I was going to have a heart attack but hey, thats what the gym is for.
Fantastic food, great atmosphere & quality drinks. 4th time here and it keeps getting better.
I am amazed that this place has such good reviews. The good is average or below. We got burnt peri peri chicken wings. It had no flavor.  we ordered Pimms Cup No1. Any half decent place would know how to make a Pimms. They don't.  We didn't stay back for the entree.  Wouldn't visit again
Dumplings were good and cheap. Had  steamed pork and chicken and took a long time because of the chicken. Also tried to bun and was not a fan. Next time I'll stay with the dumplings only
Went here for happy hour, the drinks are water down, especially the sangria. The steak is very salty and chewy, not tasty. The paella is pretty good but there's barely rice though.
"The first meal at the Bao, nice place, tasty dishes but the service........... I have never seen such d**b waiters before. They made mistakes TWICE during my meal,  1#the first one: one of them dropped a whole cup of tea which spilled out to my clothes----- no apology 2#The second one: when my friend and I finished our dishes and ready to package our leftover cake, another of them tried to take out the plates... And then he just FLIPPED OVER everything on his hand/arm including my birthday cake!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!----""I'm so sorry"" this is what he said and then walked away ... that is it!!! Obviously, no one cares about my cake! I was waiting and I hope there would be a manager or someone in charge to fix it... But no one came... Fine? Honestly, this isn't what I expect... Though I can feel the manager was trying to service us well... Which does not cope with their actual conduct  They still owed me an apology..."
Fritters supposed to be black? And I had to google to find out no. Maybe should have opened the take-out box at the place first? And everything is just so so salty, the most salty breakfast I had in months.
So usually this place is great... and the food is good... but last night the attitude on the bartender was like crazy... and she continued to have some weird conversation with the bar back in front of the patrons like we were in her living room and we weren't welcome there... it was pretty strange... I asked for a mudslide and she replied I can't make that.... when I said... it's kahula, vodka, and baileys she replied with well I can't put whipped cream on it cause we don't have whipped cream... like ok... anyway this won't stop is from coming back,  because we know the other wait staff is great... but if we see her behind the bar... we will def opt for a table... she seems to be clueless about service and this is coming from two veterans of the hospitality industry...
Commmmmmmmmmmmon. I want to love this place. Great ambiance. Great service. Amazing Tom Yum soup. Appetizers are not made from scratch, but it's ok. The entree food is good but this time I've ordered the same as the last and it was quite different in taste, much sweeter and very mildly spiced. We want authentic Thai experience, if I've wanted American Fake Thai food, I'd go to Song and Joya. Please don't change. (-1 Star) PS They finally have Beer and Wine. Great! BUT this is where I was shocked- $7 for one bottle of Chang beer. You guys realize I can get a 6 pack for $10 in a store? Rip Off. We are in Brooklyn with bunch of IPAs and imported drafts  22oz for $7-8  ( -1 Star)
I've decided to give this restaurant a try since this location is larger than the Lafayette Street location.  I guess standing right in front of the waiter did not signal that I was ready to put my name down. Instead, I was ignored as he went asking everyone outside what their name is before getting back to me. From just that one instance, my name was skipped by 2 parties. I was told there was a half hour wait for 2, but ended up waiting about an hour since my name was SKIPPED accidently. This was totally unorganized as I started to see a whole new batch of people in the street after everyone was called in for their tables. Inside.. Decor is nice, but loud. Everyone is sitting elbow-to-elbow here. It was just our luck that day that ConEd was doing drilling work across the street, making it 110% worse. The whole time we were there, people were holding their ears and grumpy. The door was endlessly opening and closing, allowing the screeching noise into the restaurant.  Now to the food.. Green Shakshuka $12 - It was good, but bland. My fiance had to add pepper for taste. It should've came with more toast.  Jack's Breakfast $19 - Steak was grilled correctly, but wasn't tender. The green sauce was tasty and spicy. I'd recommend this dish. House Cured Duck Bacon $6 - Tiny portion and mediocre taste. Not recommended.  There isn't really anything special to come back for in the future.
After reading he reviews I was excited to check this place out. Unfortunately it just didn't cut it. The waiter and reviews suggested the meat candy. It was the worst. Barley warm, chewy, not fresh, and lacked flavor. I sent them back and received chicken instead, still not impressed. Chicken was under seasoned and bland. I think this place has a lot of work to do. Mac was very saucy as well. I did come during the day so perhaps food wasn't rolling out which may have impacted the quality of food I received.
Overhyped. I ordered the uni pasta and the uni was not fresh at all. The noodles were totally undercooked and brought a whole new meaning to the term 'al dente.' The dish overall was super watered down and not very flavorful. Overpriced, especially for the lack of quality. The service wasn't terrible, but the server could have been more attentive, given that our party was only one of two in the restaurant at that time. Perhaps that should have tipped us off.
Really delicious vodka pizza. Piping hot fresh from the oven. Place was crowded and very busy. Would come back to try their other pies. Also had the blue crab pasta, it was good to try but I won't order it again. The pizza is thin crust, delicious and crispy. Service was great, very friendly and accommodating waitress.
Come for the ramen. Stay for the black cod. Sublime. It's a legendary noodle house and they make them right in the basement. They simply can't be beat. But the black cod rivals what you'll find at Nobu.
Food-5 Ambiance- 4 Value-3 Its like walking in a market in Italy surrounded by all things Italian. Add to that the convenience of 6 restaurants and many fast food service counters, fresh pasta( uncooked) to go counter, its a food lovers paradise! We had a mother daughter lunch at the pizza and pasta place. Shared fig bruschetta and a pasta. It was fresh and delicious.  We got chocolate cream filled cannoli, and a few tiny pastries - all phenomenal. I thought that everything was overpriced, though. The pappradelle pasta was $31 for a small portion. I will go back for some fresh produce and pastries.
Local..friendly staff..great vibes..went there for brunch..the wait time was fair and the service was on point..i got my free cornbreaddd...which was deelish..french toast was divine..the egg plattets not so much
"Rude staff member answered the phone with ""hello"" in an exasperated voice as if I were putting him out by calling the restaurant. I was told that they could only take reservations for large parties Staff put a bad taste in my mouth."
"went bc they're famous for being the original/oldest dim sum in chinatown tbh golden unicorn (which is within walking distance) was soooo much better, as most of the dimsum ""skins"" were super dry, old, rough. thick, and tasteless. i really liked the eggplant and turnip cake dish, but they are cheaper and of similar quality elsewhere. amex or cash only. I saw a lot of people using takeout/delivery."
This place is TINY, really tiny. But the food is good. I had pad see ew with vermicelli and chicken. There was a lot of it and it had good flavors. We got a bottle of wine for $30 - it was good but certainly not worth $30.  For a Tuesday night, there was a 30+ minute wait time for a table for two. Then! They asked if we would mind sharing a table with other people.......yes...so we had to wait longer. This place is good, but I would not go out of my way to go back. The tables are very close together and they had small plastic stools for seats. I don't know...not my style.
Really good ch and waffles and cafe ole. It's no surprise it such a busy place. Definite return.
Let me start with saying we waited about 10 min to be acknowledged. That's fine, not many people working. Second, we waited 40 minutes for our food! We ordered a stuffed pepper and fried chicken with fries. No need for a 40 minute wait!  Lastly, we waited 20 minutes for a water refill. I finally waved him down to get more water!  The food was delicious! Or it could be that I was starving and that's why it tasted amazing!  In any business experience always beats the product. Even though the food may be good, I wouldn't come back here because we didn't have a good experience.  The restroom is co-ed and needs attention.
Worst service ever. Had reservations for 7pm for 5 people. Arrived on time. 10 minute wait to be seated. Another 15 minutes for order to be taken. One hour later no food, no explanation or apology while other smaller tables seated after us were served. Several other tables told us they had been waiting 70 minutes or longer. We walked out. On the way out we were told that they were down one chef. Still does not explain the poor customer service and management. Good luck.
Great food. No wait on a Sunday. (Note: I came here on a Friday and the wait was over an hour. Free beer if you stop by between 6:00pm to 6:30 pm or from 10pm to close. 2 tapas per person works well to start out with.  Each tapas came at the perfect time as I was finishing my food. Servers were knowledgeable about the tapas ingredients. Also helpful in suggestions. Water refill came frequently. Drink Lychee Reach Rich was delicious. Must try. Kimchi paella and crispy chicken is a must try.
I took my mother to this restaurant when she was visiting New York.  The restaurant is in the financial district, so it's quite far from the city center.  The decor is nice and it has an old/vintage Shanghai vibe to it.  My grandparents on my father's side are originally from Shanghai, so growing up, I had the opportunity to savor authentic Shanghainese dishes.  I am not sure why people keep labeling this place as authentic. First off, the Shanghainese style wontons, a staple dish in Shanghai, the China Blue's version of it is nothing close to what Shanghainese wontons should be.  The wontons were Foochow style?  The very authentic Shanghainese wontons are supposed to be made with ground pork and pok choy, plus white wonton wrappers.   I was disappointed by the taste and quality of this dish.  Moving onto the crispy fried eel Wuxi style, all I could taste was the sweetness.  The dish was way too sweet.  If you like fried twizzlers, you may like the taste and texture of this dish.  I would not recommend ordering it.  We also ordered the drunken chicken and kaofu (braised wheat gluten and mushrooms), both dishes are served cold, which is the way they are supposed to be served.   They were okay.  And if you want to try Shanghai cuisines, you should order these dishes.   The one star is for the stir fired pea shoots.  That's the only dish that I thought was done right.  The right amount of garlic and soup.  The crispiness of the snow pea shoots is consistent throughout the dish.   The worst part of this restaurant is the service.  When we needed hot water for our tea or the check, it would take forever for us to get the attention of someone.  The servers were all too busy gathering around the bar and chit-chatting with each other.  A lot of them also frequently stepped out of the restaurant.  I happened to be sitting next to a side door on a very cold day, and they just kept opening the door to go in and out (not to smoke, but just to stand outside).   I understand that this is a non-tipping establishment, but they should still try to fulfill their duties.  I had worked at a non-tipping restaurant when I was in school, and I would still take care of my responsibilities during work hours.   I almost feel like the servers do not want to work here.  It's bad.  I would definitely not recommend this restaurant to anyone who needs an introduction to good (not even authentic) Shanghainese cuisines.  I certainly would not return.  This is a very disappointing dining experience.  I went from feeling excited to try this place to regretting my decision rather quickly.
Came here last night with a reservation for 2 at 7:30pm. Since Gyu-Kaku just opened, it was very busy. Definitely make a reservation! Once I checked in at the landing area, I was told that the table was finishing up and there was a little wait. I told them no worries, and my heavily pregnant friend sat down on the bench while we waited. Shortly after, another hostess came over and ask my friend if we wanted to wait upstairs instead since it was cooler and she didn't want my friend to get jostled by the people waiting. Once upstairs near the bar area, we were offered waters as we waited for our table to open up. We ordered a la carte instead of the combo deals because we wanted different things. Below is a run down of our order.  - Lychee lemonade - i'd pass, didn't taste like lychee at all, more like watered down lemonade.  - Virgin lychee bellini - my friend said it just tasted like Sprite. - Virgin mango mai tai - No mango taste.  - French fries with cod caviar sauce - fries were hot and crispy. We weren't big fans of the sauce, and they don't have ketchup - only hot sauce.  - Pork sausage fried rice - a Japanese take on dolsot bimbimbap? Portion was generous, watch out though, we didn't realized but this is a spicy dish.  - Kobe style kalbi short rib - good, but our portion seemed a bit cartilage-y, like it was tougher than usual.  - Harami miso skirt steak - good flavor, we would get again.  - Kalbi short rib (regular) - we had this after the kobe style so we didn't think it was as good. Good if you don't want to pay double the price for Kobe style.  - Japanese pork sausage - just okay, we were expecting it to be more like the ones from the skewers cart, but it was leaner and saltier. Comes with a side of mustard for dipping.  -Miso cod fish - delicious, but i accidentally cooked it too long. Comes with a mushroom in it too. - Corn - the garlic-y butter sauce is so good! We kept dipping our fries in the sauce afterwards. It comes in tin ramekins and you cook it by putting it on the grill until the butter starts to bubble. The corn is more like Korean corn, which is chewier than american sweet corn. - Garlic button mushrooms - good, pretty generic. The mushrooms are salt and peppered before wrapped in foil.  For the cons, the day we went, we were seated next to a big family with two VERY loud kids who kept screaming, yelling, and playing for much of our meal. We couldn't really hear ourselves talk because the kids were so loud and out of control. Sad part is the adults didn't do anything to calm them down. Our waitress was also super nice, but a little forgetful,which we understand because it was a full house. We had to hunt down a couple of servers for waters which didn't come until halfway through the meal and they forgot to give us bowls for the rice.  Overall, it was a good experience and I would go back again. Only wish that they had the happy hour specials that their Manhattan locations have.
The food is good but the service is HORRIBLE. Soco, if you read this know that Im not coming back. You suck and you can kiss the sweatiest part of my behind after a long workout. You suck, you suck and, you suck! And one more thing, don't advertise things on the menu that you don't actually have.
Yum! Came here with my honey for brunch. $15 unlimited mimosa for 1 hour! I had the skirt steak, potatoes and spinach. I asked for medium but it came out well done  Honey had fried chicken & waffles. Everything was great. Music, atmosphere, service was excellent, we will be back. Picture of half eaten food attached
"I went there for brunch and the food was okay but service was terrible. They said ""bottomless drink for 2 hours"" but wouldn't serve us drinks for the 1st 45 mins then still cut of off at 2hours. They also did not know what was going on and had very unfriendly waiters. Overall such a mediocre experience and wouldn't recommend."
Been here a few times and the service and ambiance is wonderful. Disappointed last time with underdone pasta, and not very hot food. We will try it again though...maybe just a fluke.
"Great to see a local neighbourhood bar. I meet the owner and had a lot of drunk talk the bar man. Both really nice and fun.  Really like the vision of the owner.  I quote the owner ""I tried the make the place beautiful from every angle"""
I'd give 3.5 stars if possible.  Good food for sure, specials are amazing. The service was also wonderful, waitress was very attentive. Portions are very small for food though, and it is a little pricy.
"Kind of a difficult review to give, as I really like the atmosphere and the service.  I also appreciate the breaking of the convention that Japanese + Soup = Ramen.  As a long-time acolyte at the temple of Udon, it's definitely a draw. That said: Do not get the chicken+mochi udon.  It says ""popular"" on the menu, but as with most things popular (and all things popular this close to NYU), it's not that good.  Mochi in broth was a new thing to me, and definitely intriguing, but after an enterprising bite of that, your curiosity is satisfied and there's still two gigantic bricks of the stuff left.  Not to complain about too much food, but when the bulk of the soup is floppy rice bricks...it's kind of disappointing. Honestly, it's not a bad place.  The broth was pretty good and the noodles were tasty.  But if the ""popular"" option is that unappetizing, I'm not sure it makes sense to try the second-best."
THEY GAVE ME FOOD POISONING ugh I feel like crap ....came here to celebrate with my boyfriend on VALENTINES DAY  because I've seen such good reviews on yelp. I ate the chicken enchilada with tomatillo sauce and it made me SOOOOO SICK all day after. That night I woke up running to the bathroom multiple times and waking up with the sweats. My stomach and appetite is quite strong and eat spicy things daily so I know it wasn't the heat. It's been 24 hours since I've eatin there and still haven't regained appetite. Thanks a lot!          Other then that the margaritas were probably the best thing on the menu I took a bite of my boyfriends chicken tacos it was very bland, not much seasoning needed some Sazon or adobo. The service was good very attentive. Many of the entrees don't come with rice and beans (that's a separate order $6) for some yellow rice and peas that could pass for the Goya box rice. Over all the food didn't scream authenticity and I'm still sick from there chicken enchiladas.... DAMN YOU ENCHILADA! Never coming here again EVER
In my opinion Up Thai is the best Thai restaurant in the upper east side. The food is always incredibly reliable. They make great curries, pad thai, pad see ew, fried rice, etc. While there are a handful of Thai restaurants that do good delivery (Up Thai included), I think the best part about Up Thai is the actual restaurant. It's beautifully decorated (classic Thai style) and a really enjoyable dining experience. Service is good and they have a nice drink menu as well. They don't take reservations for small parties but there never seems to be more than a 20 min wait even though it is always busy.
"The arepas are still delish but the service is soo bad. It's like the staff just doesn't give sh*t and makes it very apparent. Our drinks sat at the bar for a good 5 minutes while our waiter chit chatted with another employee. The same waiter took forever to bring us napkins and was clearly not busy. When we ordered our meal, we asked for the green sauce and he said they ran out but they'll take too long to make another batch. I asked approximately how long? He says ""A while"". I said ""Aw man, the sauce is the reason I come here, I love it."" He just shrugged. That's it. So about 20 minutes later, our food comes out and we start eating without the sauce. A few minutes later, we see the green sauce come out and he brings it over to another table which sat down after us. I made eye contact with him kind of wondering why the hell he exaggerated the time the sauce would be done and why he would give it to someone who came in after us especially with the enthusiasm I asked for it. He looked at me and swiftly looked away and walked back to the bar where he was hanging out. I wave him down and ask for the sauce and THEN he brought it over. It's like he gave us terrible service on purpose. This is the 2nd time I've dined here with him as our waiter (I really wish I got his name) but he needs an attitude adjustment. Maybe this kind of service is not for you my friend!"
Ramen wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Bartender was nice and service was great. Wine was more expensive than noodles for house glass of pinot. Sake selection looked amazing though.
"Don't do it...lol. Unless you are majorly craving quick lobster I don't recommend you spend 20$ here for 5""LX2""WX1""D .....Slapfish is better :D"
Come here for brunch! It's so nice to sit outside on a sunny day, close to the river, with the amount of open space impossible to find in Manhattan and having the beautifully presented dishes melting in your mouth. You can chill in the park while waiting for your table.. I will come back.
Service is terrible. It was not busy but no waiters attended to me. I waited for 30+ minutes but still no waiters acknowledged me. I was told that this restaurant usually has good service and that I don't have to sit and claim tables. Food is great though. Two people walked in after me but was immediately served.
Seating here is really tight, It makes it pretty uncomfortable to talk to the person your with because not only are you interrupted by your neighboring diners but you have no privacy. Its like sitting on a NYC subway cart. It was cold outside and we asked for some tea, They poured us two small cups...the tea was cold! It must have been sitting out for hours because they poured it out of a thermos. When we asked if we can get it heated they went out to get a new thermos and topped our tea off with some hot water... which made the tea slightly warm. gross.   Aside from the lacking service, The food was far from impressive. Everything we ordered was bland. Its like if you were to cook a quick dinner after work for yourself at home. And the soup they served is overly salty ( Miso )  -  The rise dish we got had a few tablespoons of topping and the rest was plain white rice so when we got towards the bottom your literately eating bland rice. (which is a good way to save money for the restaurant)   Also the beef skewer as way too chewy! - My guess is low quality meat. First and last experience here. Will not be returning or recommending.
3 words: chicken and waffles  That combination just sounds amazing  And going to buttermilk channel for the first time this past week was an interesting experience. My friends and I got a table outside enjoying the scenery. The host and server were very nice and attentive to our table.  So why the 3 stars? The chicken was average , I did not find a reason for the price to be higher than $20 , (that may be my inner Asian stinginess speaking) We also ordered fries  & DAMNN those fried were amazingly good.  The condiment that came with the fries ( I'm guessing truffle mayo ?) was so good  honestly I would just come back for fries.  I'm excited to go back to buttermilk channel for brunch since the pictures seem out of this world
Ehh... This is an overhyped tourist spot. The bread was brick hard. I didn't like it... maybe that's the style of bread regardless it was not edible. The pizza was pretty good. If you like condiments the pizza may be too bland for you. However I did like the pizza bc it was fresh and sweet. I did not get pasta because they had no meat on them. So basically I would pay 20 plus dollars for tomato sauce and pasta?  Overall it was an okay spot. Would I come back? No. Was it terrible NO! Is it overpriced? Hell yes!
Okay, let me start with the atmosphere. The atmosphere wasn't bad, the music is not loud. We ordered fried calmari and pad see ew. I liked the fried calmari, the portion was big enough for 2. In the other hand, the portion of pad see ew was too little. $10 for pad see ew was too much considering the portion is too small. Oh well.
Luke's lobsta rolls are da bomb! Best one I have had and I have had a few.
THE BEST Pizza ever made! I didn't get to try this place on my first trip to NY so I made it a goal to come in the second time around and wait as long as I had to. Thankfully I didn't wait more than 10 minutes and the pizza exceeded all expectations. A small is more than enough for 2 people, they're pretty big pizzas. When I came in, I honestly have to say the pizzas didn't look appealing. When my mouth got a taste of it, I couldn't stop!!!!! I'm craving this pizza ever since   I'm so glad I came here! Best pizza I had in NY by far!
This place doesn't live up to the hype. I love soup dumplings and had them from Vietnam to Singapore and these just don't cut it.
Cute place. Friendly service. Very popular spot, particularly it seems for the happy hour - which is well deserved. They have some great specials (small bites - get the escargot!) and wine flights. The wine flights are a generous pour and come in set sets or choose your own mix &a match. The dinner food is also decent.  I've been here twice and wouldn't hesitate to come again despite my preference to try new places (it's NYC after all!)
I came here for a girls night out celebrating my sister's upcoming wedding.  We got seats in the outdoor space.  I came to Mominette, because I had seen pictures of their outdoor space online, and thought it was a beautiful place to celebrate her going away.  The outdoor space didn't disappoint. It's very charming.  Since the reviews are so good, I'm going to assume our experience was a fluke.  When our food arrived, the bride-to-be's food never came.  When we asked the server what may have happened, he went and spoke to someone and then informed us that her order had been missed somehow and that they would prepare it now.  He was kind enough to not charge us for her entree which we did appreciate very much.  We didn't want to begin eating our dinner's in front of the bride so we waited to eat our dinner until we could all eat together.   We waited half an hour.  When they finally gave her, her food, ours was cold and though we expressed that to the staff they didn't offer us any options (heat it up? any microwaves back there?).  We ate our food, which was surprisingly underwhelming.   A lot of our entrees lacked salt which was expressed in between bites of moderate delight, since the food was good (but just good). I expected for the food to be delicious.  Mid way through the dinner the servers then asked politely if we would all get up so that they could move our table over for a bigger party.  Umm.... Okay. Sure. They then gave us a complimentary round of shots which again was very nice.  But for the occasion, it was all too much of an inconvenience.  I probably won't return. The bride felt the experience was too awkward. The outdoor space is beautiful, the staff is nice, but the experience was difficult to get over.
"The food was decent but the service was the absolute worst.  From the time we ordered it took over an hour to get our food.   In that hour no one said a word to us, no appolgy, no explanation, nothing.  When the food came the only thing the waiter said was, ""your food is finally here."".    He never came back again until we called him for the bill and even then he didn't ask us how are food was.   In the time we were there we watched the restaurant fill up and start to empty, we watched tables sit, order, eat and leave, our drinks laid empty the entire time.  When we got the bill for our party of two we noticed gratuity was included, so we were cheated on leaving our ""server"" an appropriate tip.    I suggest avoiding at all costs."
Solid ramen place without huge crowds.  Lunch set is an amazing menu. We shared three ramen lunch sets between 4 people.  Everything was solid. Some of the ingredients tend to have a spicy kick to it. If you don't like spicy food, be sure to ask the waiter to eliminate the ingredients that are spicy.  The tantan ramen with ground pork and spicy coconut curry was good but a bit too greasy for my taste. Tonkotsu (pork based broth) was delicious. Add bamboo shoots to it as a nice addition.  Small size ramen seems small but pretty filling after we devoured them.  The gyoza and pork belly addition to the lunch set are also well put together.  Food comes fast - be ready to tackle when they do!
I called this restaurant today asking for a Torta - when she gave me an option between two different kinds, I asked her to repeat them because I did not hear her (it was very loud on the other side of the phone). After she repeated the two options, I responded with my choice. The girl then told me to call back when I was ready because she had customers on the other line who actually knew what they wanted.   NEVER AGAIN!  Very rude.
Really enjoyed this place. Skip the appetizers and go straight for the rice bowls on the second page. We got the tuna and the scallops appetizers. Tuna was particularly yummy but both were a lot smaller than expected. Not really worth it. Rice bowls were all spectacular. We got the eel, the beef, and the chicken. Definitely not lacking in flavor! Great service and dark quiet ambiance. Will come back.
Scratching my head after eating here.  All of the stellar reviews, the flocks of people waiting to be seated in the cavernous dining room by 6:30(!) on a saturday and the overwhelming familiarity the waitstaff had with the clearly regular customers are all hallmarks of a incredible place.  The food was a major disappointment, The calamari was well textured.  Its flavorless breading is not a problem when the sauce it's served with rocks, but it was middling, which made the dish more of a chore to eat than a pleasure.  The sicilian pizza wasn't much better.  Crust was decent, but the sauce and cheese were nothing you couldn't get anywhere else.  The grated cheese they offer on the side is some sort of (maybe) edible white shavings. The bright spot was the service.  Nice folks and even with the place jumping, the waiters were friendly and fast.  Troubling note:  Some of them looked awfully young, like child labor violation young. Overall, it's certainly not worth the trip to go there.  If it's a nice day and you are in the area, they having a slice outside probably isn't a bad idea.
Very disappointed in the restaurant. Not only is the service horrible in person and by phone but they have the nerve to want $15 for a 4 inch crab roll?  Bye Felecia!
I actually really enjoyed my food here both times I've ordered lunch there. Always on the look out for a good low carb high protein salad. Their chicken tawook and lamb kebab are both good. Reason for 1-star was two mistakes, one of them major. My first salad I got kalamata olives that appeared all pitted, all except one olive was pitted, ended up crushing it my molar, that was rather unpleasant. Honest mistake, so I went back a 2nd day at lunch. I bought dolmas to take home to my wife for dinner (thought it was cool how they sell their sides). There was a metal staple in her Dolma!
Great food. Just not good to go with big groups,  like most places in the city. Service ducked pretty bad but other than that the food was good.
Very good taste and nice staff. Expensive for the portion size, especially for dumplings. 4 for 6$ update: wow. They've raised prices on noodle soups, not good enough for the price, sorry.
I found the spicy miso ramen here unremarkable.  The miso broth was a bit bland. The noodles had a good consistency and I enjoyed the large slices of pork which was tender, slightly grilled on the outside. The egg was perfectly done. The mushrooms I added didn't have much flavor though they added some textural contrast. I was disappointed that the spicy sauce came separately. It was quite tasty and I should really have just added it fully to my bowl from the beginning.  I'd come here again for a quick lunch since it's close to my office but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to come here.  Very efficient service. Some higher bar level seating and some lower tables in the back. Plenty of open seats around 1:15 on a weekday.
Best brisket in Brooklyn!  The people who work there are helpful on portion size and what to order for how many people are dining I didn't love the ribs or the sides but the brisket more than makes up for it! Love
Supposed to be the most pepperoni slice ever I see everybody Caucasian coming out with tons of pepperoni on their slice he makes a face and gives me one with 6 pieces on it will never get my money again I don't like prejudice people the slice was not all that either taking my business elsewhere
This is the best pizza in Financial District. Super delicious - you gotta try the old fashioned pizza. It starts at 25 dollars, and each additional topping is $3-$4 dollars. It is definitely on the pricier side, but well worth it; plus, the thing is huge! Easily take at least 3 people to finish. I prefer these pizza squares than other floppy New York style pizzas because the dough is just perfect texture. In addition, they have perfect sauce-cheese ratio as well. Sometimes the pepperoni slices can be very greasy, but the taste is still super great.
Cheap hole-in-the-wall joint with good food. Venue is really small with limited seating along the walls. Don't expect good service since this place is really casual. Food is great for the price.
"Tonight's service was particularly terrible.  It started with me asking if there's any special, which is reasonable considering they have always pointed it out.  The bartender rudely said, ""Everything is printed on the menu.""  No duh!  I have been coming here for over a year.  The usual bartender that I have interacted with in the past have always pointed out things that I should consider.  After I placed my order, the person sat next to me had a whole fish presented to them which I did not see on the menu.  I was disappointed that this was not presented to me as an option, since I've always ordered the special.   To make matters worse, the flat noodles that I ordered tasted terrible and was not fully cooked...  I had to eat it because it was 10:30PM and no other restaurants opened at that hour.   And the negroni was so text book and tasted so basic.  A total disappointment!  #neveragain"
"I'm not even going to start with the incredible Ramen - no, the first thing I absolutely must mention is the Black Edamame appetizer, which was simply the best edamame I've ever eaten.  Flash-fried with chills and yuzu.  The blast of lemony yuzu when you first bite into the edamame skin is simply glorious.  The texture and the flavors are such a delight... I fear it may have ruined regular edamame for me forever.   I ordered the eponymous Mu Ramen, which was rich, complex and superb.  They are rightfully proud of the complex, marrow bone-soaked broth they create.  The chunks of brisket and pickles floating in the luxurious broth felt like a unique, special ramen treat to me.  Also, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the presentation.  Now, when I'm the one actually eating (and not watching Chopped and trying to judge at home), I occasionally find presentation overrated - give me a tasty mess any day of the week - but there's a reason there are over 1000 photos on their Yelp page... they know how to tie up delicious food with a beautiful bow.  My friends had the Tonkotsu 2.0 and Spicy Miso, respectively, and loved theirs every bit as much as I loved mine (so much so, I don't believe we shared).  It's only beer and sake, but it's an eclectic list - they have an incredible Japanese oyster stout (expensive - $13) that paired perfectly with my ramen.  One note - I went for lunch on a Thursday, so no wait whatsoever. I'd love to throw in the ""it's so worth a two hour wait"" but... Look, I get as hangry as the next person. It's a tiny place, about 15 communal seats. It's wonderful - plan a trip - lunchtime, a time you have two hours to kill at the nearby beer bar... just do it!"
"After hearing others speak good things about this restaurant, I decided to give it a try. I ordered the ""Famous crab roll"" and a crab taco.  I was EXTREMELY disappointed! The crab roll didn't actually come on a roll, but on what looked like a hot dog bun. Maybe they ran out of rolls for the day and had to substitute, but that was a HUGE failure in my book. On top of that it was very dry and was nothing but the crab and ""roll"" The ""crab"" taco was covered in a huge mound of shredded cabbage and drizzled with a chipotle mayo.....dry and had no flavor. Overall I was highly disappointed with the food. Hopefully they can improve over time."
"I use to love this place but the attitude of the owner sucks!I was a frequent customer  in the but since relocating  I have not been there in awhile.However a group of my friends wanted to eat good Thai food so we decided  to  go  toJoya because they never disappoint in regards to food . When I got there  I headed to the desk to inform the staff that we would need a table for six so the owner who was on the phone stated that we could not be seated until our entire party was there, this is standard procedures for some  restaurants.So  the three  people of the party of six  proceded to the bar to buy  three drinks.  Which we did! About 5 mintues later  the other three show up so I kindly got up to inform the staff that the whole party was here and before I could say anything  the owner puts his finger up and says you dont have to come back just sit down until you are called then proceeds to get back on the phone. My friend says to me that was rude then the owner proceeds to say very rudely  ""I am the owner and I am not rude I am just busy, if you think I am rude there is the door."" What!! Who does that to people who spends their money in your establishment. That is not how business is conducted. If he was so busy how was he able to respond being so mean. What owner has such behavior. Of course we left and spent our money wisely at a restaurant that has better customer service.I would not recommend  this place base on the attitude of the owner! Shame on you!"
No happy hour but great decor and really good praram...that's peanut sauce all over my tofu and steamed vegetables!  Four stars for being in one of my favorite parts of town, I don't know about the Chang Lager (thai beer) it was just so-so jus so you know..
Ate here with some friends. 1 ordered the pad thai because I love it. However, the pad thai here was subpar at best. I asked for extra spicy and the hot sauce they use added way too much acidity and sourness. If it sounds gross, that's because it tasted kind of gross. And while 1 usually like lemons more than lime, time needs to come with my pad thai. Lemon just doesn't taste right. Lastly, though this should've been first, the waiter's thumb was all up in my bean sprouts when he brought the food out. Blech. Maybe this experience was a fluke compared to usual, but I expected something better for a restaurant with such good ratings.
Friendly staff, cute and clean place. Thats it. Cocktails were awful and all the food was average. Ok it was eatable, but when you pay 20$-$28 for a ceviche you are expecting awesome. The fish was not fresh enough and there was way too many ingredients to make the fish disappear. Tasted almost all the ceviches and none of them are worth that kind of money.
One of my summer go tos the fish tacos and the loaded corn with queso and mayo is life. Topped off with a frozen margarita. They have outside sitting in the summer and it really does remind u of an old rustic authentic taco joint right in the middle of Brooklyn. Me n and friends come here all the time but mostly in the summer. The food is made to order so u wait patiently until your number is called.
"Good, authentic Mexican food in NYC... what a concept! Hey I was skeptical at first too. I've been promised good ""Mexican"" food in NYC before that ultimately turned out to be Italian food with salsa. But that's not this place... I had a brisket taco that actually reminded me of being in Mexico. And my pozole! Very gourmet but in a Mexican sorta way. This was our first time in LIC so it felt a bit not like NYC to us (Berkeley maybe?!) but if they make food like this maybe we'll continue to return. If I had one complaint, I think the service could be tightened up a bit (tried to seat us at the worst table, a bit too eager in trying to take away half-full cocktails, etc.) but maybe they were in training or something. The food was authentic and wonderful and the ambiance of the restaurant was casual and cozy (could do without all the kids). So if all I ever have to worry about is an over-eager staff... I'm in..."
I came on a Monday night and it was very busy. I had to wait a little while for a table (maybe 10 minutes). I would have rather sit at the bar but it was packed. Their wine list and decent and they have some delicious sounding cocktails. I settled on the Decoy Cabernet and got the crab cake appetizer and the salmon entrée. The crab cake entrée was delicious! The small was quite large, the large sized must be huge. It was a lot of crab, not much filling. It was nestled atop some roasted tomatoes and had arugula on top. I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and it paired well with the beets and pistachio. I glanced at the dessert menu but decided to pass. The waitstaff was nice but I kind of felt rushed. Like they want to turn over the tables as fast as humanly possible and they get mad if you linger without purchasing more food/drink. Definitely not a place to just hang out with friends. It's kind of like, get in, eat, and get out.
The little owl always caught my eye as a cute little corner restaurant while we walked around West Village. Yes it's the same location as Central Perk in Friends and no it has nothing to do with Friends and also doesn't look anything like Central Perk. It's always pretty packed and reservations are hard to get. If you want to try this place out, my recommendation would be to make reservations.  We had brunch here and tried the chilaquiles and their version of eggs Benedict along with an order of Brussels sprouts. The chilaquiles were really tasty, tortilla chips soaked in cholula hot sauce with some queso fresco on top, a bit of avocado and 3 fried eggs make this a deconstructed version which I really liked. The biscuit and pork patty in the eggs Benedict were delicious. The Brussels sprouts are totally avoidable. They were fine. We were kicking ourselves for trying to be healthy and choosing brussel sprouts over beignets which looked so good on the table next to us.  We had cafe au lait and Clamato ( tomato + clam juice), wasn't a fan of either. Who orders Clamato juice, aaparebtlI do !  The service was really good, from the time we had to wait for the table, till we got out, they were attentive and nice. This is not one of those brunch places where you can't  linger, they have very few tables and their turn around time is about 45 mins or less, so it will be a quick one.    This is a nice little neighborhood joint serving decent brunch fare, if you are in the neighborhood or a super fan of friends, this might be your spot.
ABC has been in my bookmarks for a while, even though I've been to their sister place, ABC Cocina... Which was awesome by the way. I could see why everyone likes the place and the decor, which is very minimal and clean, but I can't say I fell for the hype food wise.  Don't get me wrong, everything was fine, I especially liked the ricotta toast with the strawberry compote, but I can't say I was blown away by anything... Especially for the price point ($250 per couple, with tip).
Service was good our waitress Grace was sweet , the establishment is very small and the tables are close together which I didn't like. Now on to the food we started off with some poppers which were basically mini croissants with honey and sea salt , (not a fan ) but my sisters liked it we all got the cheddar waffles and fried chicken which is served with coleslaw and I'm not a major fan of coleslaw but this one was amazing lol the waffles were good as well chicken need some work it was under cooked think it should of been fried a little harder. Overall ok experience for a last minute birthday dinner for my sister party of 3 we were told it was an hour wait but a 9:15 reservation canceled so we got seated shortly after arriving ! Dress is casual.
I had the lovely pleasure of meeting up with fellow yelper Lerue and her friend here for brunch one rainy Saturday.  None of us have been here and thought why not since we heard great things.  I will say they are serious when they say you have an 1hr wait. We had some delicious bellinis until our table was ready. By that point my stomach was eating my back. We started with the biscuits... yummy!!! For my dish I had the pecan pie french toast. I wasn't a fan of the bourbon that was a part of the sauce. I can't remember what my comrades got but  I remember them being happy. I do believe I may have had a better experience if I got something else.  I will say their bartenders were on point and that alone will get me to come back.
I visited NYC back in 2006 with a planned itinerary of touristy stuff to do.  However, walking across the Brooklyn Bridge was not on the agenda. That spontaneous act led to an accidental discovery on the other side of the bridge which was worth the walk between busy fast car traffic.  It was already 2 pm when I spotted a line out-the-door of a pizza joint. 2 pm is when most places wrap up their lunch crowd; I was still full from my lunch, but just had to find out what all the fuzz was about.  I got to eat the best thin crust pizza ever.  It has been 10+ years later now, and I still have not found pizza of equal quality.
I would break it down like this: - Amazing looking place - Food wasn't great - Service on the second floor was terrible. How do you expect one waitress to take care of those tables traveling up those stairs. I asked for a glass of water and it took forever because the poor lady had to climb up two flights to get to me. It wasn't her fault it was the restaurant. - The chicken chicharon wasn't that at ALL. It was chicken cabob. Don't call it what it's not. - Drink was pretty good. Got coconut mojito. - Plus a fight broke out at the table behind mine ruining the night. The focus was mainly on that table and it left a bitter taste in our mouths about it. Maybe one day it will change.  - Oh and the live band was EXTREMELY LOUD. I had to yell over to my wife just to see how she liked her food. It was unbearable.
"A friend and I who live in LIC just tried this place, as we were pretty excited for its opening. Unfortunately, we left disappointed.  It seems like everything went wrong. We got very excited about ordering the stuffed shishido peppers - but were told they ""were not making them"" that night.  Kind of weird. So we ordered the Prawn entree instead... mainly b/c they had a side of the peppers... and oddly were still serving them as a side, but not an entree, b/c it took ""too much effort"" to make the stuffed ones.  Anyhow, we were very disappointed w/ the prawns and orzo... both seemed very overcooked.   Then we presented the guy w/ a coupon we had been given for a free drink.   It then took pretty long to get the bill as the first machine he tried to run our cards on was broken. When we finally got the bill, we noticed they had not honored the coupon.   We asked them and they said it was expired.  We pointed out it actually had just become active. They conceded and offered to run our cars again with discount; we didn't even feel like waiting, so declined.  Overall, the experience was poor and even AWKWARD.  I'm sad this new 'station' didn't exceed the one one...."
Cute little place. I went by myself. Fast service. Lots of seating. Ramen was good, but nothing special. There was no wait time when I got there. It wasn't that expensive. Perfect for a quick lunch.
Just not good. My boyfriend and I had been wanting to try Sweet Science for awhile now and decided to go for brunch. We were completely disappointed all the way around. I ordered the burger-- medium rare. It came out well done and tasted like a dry burnt burger from a cookout in the park. I mentioned to the server that the cook was wrong on the burger and he brushed me off. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffles. While the actual waffle was good, the chicken tasted like old fish grease and was super dry! Boooooooo! (Manager was very nice and offered us a drink for the bad experience, but we were just over it all at that point and declined the offer.)
The ramen was good, but the service was horrible the worst I've ever gotten and by everyone on staff! I got their at 3:15pm (they close at 4:00pm) and the waiter told me that last call was in 10min, then came back with 3min time deadline. He didn't let us order dumplings cause the kitchen was close ( even though it was 3:37pm), then they made us pay as we were eating the ramen, the bathroom was closed!! I mean seriously worst service ever. Won't come again ever. Even if they pay to come back, I wouldn't
Only tried two dishes when I came here for brunch; wasn't too impressed with either. The garganelli with mushroom ragu was not flavorful - although it was beautiful to look at, with ribbons of mozzarella heaped over it.  The L'artusi scramble was tastier but there isn't too much of an art to making good scrambled eggs and some nicely crisped potato cubes... Service was great and the restaurant is a wonderful, airy space, good for groups - but I had hoped that the food would be something more to write home about since I had heard so much about the restaurant!
This place is the Real Deal. cancel any other plans you may have had, and come here tonight. Better yet, come here now. NOW! Food is delicious, interesting flavor combinations.  Service is superb.  Atmosphere is electric. Value is amazing.  Octopus: brilliant w scallion/mango Paella: more like risotto - LOVE IT Pork belly taco: complex and really good Chicken: how all sweet/sour chicken be done. Crispy outside, tender inside, non greasy at all - perfection  Angry fries: too much heat for me Bread pudding: heavenly  It was an hour wait, worth it. As I watched and observed the staff/team, they are truly invested into this place - their passion and enthusiasm shows in their interaction with each other, and with the customers, and in the food and drinks :) ------------------------------ Review from my dinner date: Almost everything was spot on here!  The first four were well-composed: there was a good balance of sweet, spicy, tart, crunchy, and creamy along with appropriate seasoning for each.  The angry sweet potato fell a bit short without crunch or refreshing tart to counter the sweet/spicy/creamy combination (maybe cold pickled veg on the side or topping the cheese sauce?). Overall a very good meal though, highly recommended!
Was excited to try this place when cousin showed me pics of the desserts but ended only having one to share bc they ran out of the chocolate bomb...the food was only ok, nothing bad but nothing exceptional..it was rather quiet on a Thursday night but decor is very nice.
Rubirosa is one of my my top 3 thin-crust pizza restaurants. Right after A'pizza Scholls in Portland and right above Speedy Romeo's. Notably, nested slightly above Scarr's, Prince Street, and Bay Area fave Arnell's. Good pizza isn't about it's price tag, and Rubirosa is not cheap eats. Some might say that paying $20 + for pizza is silly, but I would say, not when it's worth it.  The right balance of cheesy-creamy salty- with tomato zip, the perfect crunch through the bottom crust and sink through the top, well it's debatable if that balance can be achieved as well as it is at Rubirosa by anyone else. We go half margarita, half tie dye. Yes, you can get tie dye which means all the best sauces come together on one delectable slice.  The small size is enough for two, but get the large and you have leftovers--might at well pay off that wait time with a couple meals right? Also dig the Ceasar, which the addition of basil makes refreshing over garlicky and the house red. We usually split one salad, one pasta, one pizza, and wine before heading home to happily pass out.
1st cash business only.!!!! ATM in side  $2.00 free very careful coming out C subway walk in to colorful EMPTY ATM.!! If meet up with friends get seated 1st great outdoor space can get crowned quickly!!! Random Spanish loud music playing in the back ground. Very colorful decor.fun, bus~vibrait party good food I have the chicken burrito, friend had mango salad stayed it was fantastic. drinks might little bit overpriced. I'm not a big fan eating corn cob but it was popular is cover so much cheese & spicy Sseasoning looked good.
Just came back here after about a year and found a draft review, so let's polish this baby off and share it with the world! From the moment you step into the crowded interior and are overwhelmed by the crowd, you can tell that this place is popular. Good thing we had reservations! We got seated and started with the bread, which (per my Italian Bread Theory (c)) is great, foreshadowing good Italian food to come. Then came the pastas. We get 3 items, because we are hungry people in general, and because their pasta is delightful.  We got the garganelli, the gnocchi, and the fish (I forget which kind, which is a serious deficiency in my review, I understand). The pastas are both awesome, and highly recommended. The fish (not salmon, but close!) was also great, and really balanced out the meal.  We also ordered the hazelnut chocolate torta for dessert, which they promptly forgot about. But no worries, because they comped it when they realized the problem! And it was delicious, chocolate and hazelnut and ice cream and yes, I'd recommend it.  Good place!
3.5 stars but I rounded up. WAIT: Came on a Sunday night at 7pm and the wait for our group of 7 was about 35-40 minutes.  We were quoted an hour but got in much quicker! The line moves pretty quickly, which is good.  In case you are wondering, yes, you do have to wait in line.  Someone from their staff will come by and ask how many in your group. ATMOSPHERE: The inside seems small but they can fit a good amount of tables.  They have big round ones, smaller ones or 2 people etc.  It's a clean, open kitchen/oven restaurant with lots of white.  It feels modern. FOOD: The food comes out pretty quick.  We ordered our pizzas and I would say within 10 minutes they were out.  It probably helps to keep the people eating quickly and then leaving. For the 7 of us, we opted for 3 large pies because the difference in price was pretty small.  This allowed each of us to eat 3 slices and then a few got to eat 4.  The slices are pretty thin and small so even for someone that normally eats 2 slices, 3 was enough. NO. 1 - some people in our group thought this was too salty but I liked it.  The Italian bacon was crispy and tasted a little like saltier sausage.  This is a white pie, which I liked as well.  No tomato, the truffle flavor was very very subtle.  I liked the green onions on top. NO. 4 - this is a mix between a white and a tomato sauce pie because it did have some red sauce. it's a typical prosciutto + arugula pizza with tons of arugula sprinkled on top post bake.  It was pretty good, especially if you like prosciutto.  MARGHERITA - classic pizza, and one of the ones people liked the most.  The marinara sauce was tangy, which I don't actually really like.  It was probably my least favorite (but I prefer white pies).  The crust, which is what I really measure my pizzas by was pretty thin.  It held its own when you held it up, so it didn't droop down and the toppings didn't all fall off with one bite.  The crust gets better as you go towards the end, it becomes more firm and more chewy (which is what I like).  I really like those pizzas with the huge crust at the end, very soft, fluffy and chewy, with bubbles.  I think it's more of a Neapolitan pizza? Regardless, it was definitely a decent/good pizza, but not the best I've had nor my preference.  I think for what you are paying (most were 25-30 for a large pie), it seems a little pricey for getting something that I could probably get elsewhere for a little cheaper. Overall, a good one to take friends to and if you're in DUMBO and they've already tried Grimladi's.
We placed our delivery orders here for the first time. We ordered soft shell crabs and shrimps in a garlic butter sauce. The food came in a nice portion but everything was very very salty. It's like they boiled the shrimps in the salt water and put a lot of extra salt on the top of it. The fried soft shell crabs were burned and also super salty. Very disappointing.
Been curious about this place for a while now...and most reviews seemed ok....but I was disappointed. The seafood wasn't that fresh at all, so of course that killed the taste and quality of this whole dinning experience. Pro: *Loved the well prepared set up with the utensils, bowl holding the bag of food so it doesn't leak, and the almost apron size bib provided (outstanding!!) *Takes credit cards, Amex included *Linda, our very friendly server, she let me try a little of the spicy sauce before I placed my first order, and it wasn't the kind of spicy that would linger and numb your tongue for hours. But a nice kick that you can feel the heat by your throat for a minute and then slowly dissipates. *Bf said his drinks were good (IPA beer and Oceanic Passion fruit drink with sake) * They can do sauce on the side, in case you prefer dipping into a cup as you eat. :) *They offer delivery ! And we were able to wrap leftovers to go. Con: *Overall staff wasn't attentive and there were two other couples there tonight. Our water was never refilled, and the other girl was more into singing to the music and staring at the TV.  * Charges extra for sauce, even though seafood portion vs sauce isn't taken into consideration when mixing in the bag. They just give you this one size cup of sauce for any size order....which is inconsiderate ..who ever is in the kitchen or made this rule, clearly doesn't cook for large amounts and knows adjustments for seasoning amount is required!!! * SEAFOOD WASN'T FRESH!!....big no no.... * My bf said Popeye's has better Cajun fries than this place...:/ and soft shell crabs he ordered was so/so. (folks...he is very easily pleased when it comes to food.) Lastly, the green tea flan ....was more like pudding, didn't taste bad...but nothing like a traditional flan texture at all ....but the coconut flan tastes pretty good. (It's sweeter tho and thicker texture)
The pizzzaaaa. Please get the pizza. Do get a reservation (before the day of) since a wait for two around 6:30 was 45 minutes.  My friend and I ordered half vodka/half supreme pizza and spinach pappardelle. Having been born in BK, it's hard for a pizza to impress me.. but this one did it. The pasta (which is usually my favorite food ever) was much less impressive.  I will definitely be back - and getting only pizza. Many pizzas. All the pizzas.
"Of course this was on the ""must go to"" list during my East Coast trek, and given I had very little time to prepare, imagine my excitement that I was able to snag a reservation here just one week prior to my trip.   Unlike many of the well known eats in NYC, Peter Luger's is located in Williamsburg, and from Brooklyn you can either Uber/Lyft or take the more scenic route via the ferry.  The restaurant itself is located in a residential neighborhood and if you decide to get there by ferry, it's a brisk yet quiet 10 minute walk where you can get away from the hustle and bustle; very unlike NYC! Upon walking in, it's a pretty intimate yet open environment, and it was already packed at 4:45 PM!  We were seated pretty quickly and had our eyes set on the steak for 2.  I was in love after the first bite...it is definitely on my ""top 5"" steaks...that tender melt in your mouth type good.  Plus, the house sauce they serve with it topped it all off.   The one regret I have though is not ordering the bacon.  How could I forget about the bacon!!!  Argh...The service was incredible; our waiter constantly checked up on us, and even served the steak on our plates.   Just one note to keep in mind.  This place is CASH ONLY so come prepared with those 100's!"
Clearly a lot of the reviews posted here are paid. This restaurant deserves no more than 2 stars, and maybe not even that. The food is mediocre at best, and the service is far from acceptable. I arrived early for my reservation and was not seated until at least 45 minutes later, before which I was told that my reservation had been cancelled because I hadn't checked in at the front. I did check in when I first arrived with one of the managers, actually. She was extremely cold and didn't even ask for my name-I had to make sure she knew I had a reservation. I am extremely unimpressed.
"Updated review 7/13 I really wanted to love this place. The food is good and they deliver to my side of Bushwick but after a few orders, I noticed this place is inconsistent (they will randomly be closed during regular hours) and their delivery person was so beyond rude to me after he went to a different address than the one given. ugh WHY WONT YOU LET ME LOVE YOU DANNEE THAI amazing food. Delivery is far and wide and  I'm so appreciative of that because I live in bushwick. Also when you say ""spicy"", they really make it spicy  noodles are great, basil fried rice is great, spring rolls rule!"
The caprese salad, chicken parmigiana, and cannoli were fantastic. Service was attentive and friendly.
This place is a 100% MUST-TRY in NYC. Please, PLEASE order their Thai Iced Tea--so on point! I came to NY for the weekend and gave this place a shot. The restaurant was a little hard to find, but we found it eventually. If you ever want to experience a taste of Thailand, in my opinion, this is the perfect spot. My sister and I had to wait 30 minutes until we got seated in this tiny and narrow restaurant, but it was the best 30 minutes of waiting. I got to witness and experience how Thai people interact with each other. All the staff are so friendly and joking towards one another, you can definitely feel the love between them all. The Thai music in the background was perfect--not some Americanized restaurant with American music, which is something I really appreciate.  I ordered the Dry Pork and Crab Noodle, Chicken Curry Puffs, Steamed Veggie Dumplings, and the Pork Noodle Soup. I would give the food a 3.5/5, but maybe I'm not much of a Thai food enthusiast to appreciate their food. I would definitely come back to experience this warm and welcoming restaurant, though. :)
This review is solely for dinner. Make sure to make reservations. I called and P&K was able to accommodate a party of 7 on Saturday evening. It's loud and busy on weekends. I'm not a fan of fusion, but Pig & Khao can get a pass. Pork Adobo $13 - I really enjoyed the pork adobo. The meat was soft and super fatty, the sauce was amazing. We put the sauce over the rice and it was a perfect combo. Shan Noodles $16 - Delicious and packed with flavor. It reminded me of a spicy Vietnamese Pho noodle. Good for two. Chicken Wings $12 - This dish was the daily special offered by our waitress. The wings had sweet/spicy skin. Beware of the peppers. They are dangerously hot. Sizzling Sisig $15 - The sisig is my favorite dish when coming to P&K. The sisig is served on a sizzling platter with a strong, delicious aroma. Mixing the raw egg into the crispy sisig made the dish so tasty! This is a greasy and oil dish. Coconut Rice $3 - The coconut rice is super sweet. The bowl is big and can be shared between two people. The salty/greasy sisig pairs well with the coconut rice.  BBQ Ribs $25 - Smokey, burnt, and pricey for what you get. I'll pass on this next time. Chicken Inasal $22 - Most of the pieces came out charred and burnt so we left pieces untouched. Chicken was dry without the sauce. I'll also pass on this next time. Market Vegetable $7 - Decent, but a very small serving. Pass
The Food does Not have taste. The $7,50 ramen is just the same you can get in the supermarket for $1.50 plus one egg. The pork was to greasy.  $31 dollars wasted.
Khao Soi was pretty damn close to my mom's version so needless to say... Pig and Khao's version was delicious! The noodles were cooked perfectly, however it just seemed like a bowl of noddles swimming in the curry broth/sauce. I personally like a big hunk of chicken or beef on top with more pickled radish and fried shallots, but the flavor was good. Overall, a very meat heavy/pork heavy place, so I would recommend getting the prawns or sirloin or other dishes to shake it up. Service was good, but I don't think our server was super helpful- he was kind of snide and seemed impatient so that is mostly the reason for the 4/5.
The food was very, very good. The service was really really bad. We felt seriously neglected. We had to keep asking where our wine was (if they had left it on the table we would have served ourselves). The staff would disappear for long stretches. We had to flag them down. Is this the result of the no-tipping policy? Hard to think it isn't. I would not go back. There are many many places in the city with food as good or better, with decent service. Very disappointing overall. The stars are for the food.
"This place looks very nice, until you get to the Unfriendly bitter host who should NOT work in customer service. We were 4 people w a 6months old baby who was sleeping. The host  told us a bitter NO space for a stroller,  after I pointed out the fact that there was an stroller already in the place, she told me, that's the only spot they have for strollers... Miss host if you were having a bad day, sorry but as a host it is your job to accommodate and treat All customers equally, there's no such thing as ""only one spot for strollers"" get it together!"
You can tell this place is really cool from the mobs of people waiting outside on the street. The hostess was super friendly and they text you when your table is ready. Got all of the pickles they serve and while I had some favorites over others it was just cool to see them splayed out on wooden planks and in mason jars.  We got the poutine, which was a mountain of food full of greasy and oily goodness. I ordered the egg and cheese biscuit sandwich and that was a letdown. There was a huge pile of shredded cheese on top but not melted, just sitting there. It also was served in a way where you need a fork and knife rather than eating with my hands. Just a misrepresentation when they wrote sandwich. The biscuit itself was yummy though.  Oh also they had an amazing playlist. It's loud but you can still hear the others at your table.  Overall, a very good and trendy place. I'd just order differently next time.
I used to love this place. Yeah the location isn't great but they do deliver and you can get takeout. I don't know where they started going so wrong. Their food is so inconsistent. I had to stop eating there because more often than not I found myself having to reheat chicken that looked weird and getting sick anyway.  However the service is consistent. It's horrible. Look out because they will make up new policies. For example: they will give you dark meat when you ask for white because the kitchen has too much dark meat. Oh and they can charge you extra for this also. The customer is always wrong. This is why I'm not eating there anymore. It's like going to visit mean grandma's house where you don't get what you asked for and you get scolded. No thanks.
"I was told this was the best pizza in the city so perhaps my expectations were a bit too high. Honestly, I was unimpressed. The pizza was tasty, but not different from any other thin crust pizza I've had. We got mortadella on half and it ended up having just a small piece on each slice. We also shared mozzarella sticks which were just fine. Overall it was a fine place to eat but not a ""wow"" for me."
Food was good, but nothing to rave about, unfortunately. I've had Pig and Khao bookmarked for some time and was very excited to dine here. The menu is creative, which enticed me even more, however, the food was just OK. I love sisig and it's my go-to dish when dining at a Filipino restaurant, but the sisig here left more to be desired. It was good, but just that .. good. I've had more flavorful ones at other places, although it wasn't bad. The pork jowl was prepared with brussel sprouts, which I liked, however, it tasted a tad too salty for my taste. The saltiness might have been better if paired with a side of rice, but we opted out of it to get a true taste of the stand-alone dishes.  The eggplant appetizer was pretty good, though, and served with shrimp chips on the side. That was a new one for me, which stood out more than the mains.  MUST TRY: sweet & sour cilantro soda, which tastes like a mojito!
"I will start off by saying overall our experience was relative. The Food was very good (pricey but it's Hoboken) which we expected based on the reviews. Now on to why the 2 star rating. We made reservations and we got seated right away, as soon as we walked in. However ""right away"" isn't always a good thing, since they gave us the table right by the front door. This meant: 1. We were right under the speaker, so we couldn't hear each other. 2. It was cold since there's no vestibule and every time the door opened we got a blast of cold air. 3. Because of number 2 we had to keep our jackets on while we ate, which is uncomfortable in multiple ways. 4. There's no waiting area so people were standing all around us while we ate, which again is very uncomfortable.  5. FYI: We did ask for a different table but were told it would be a 1.5 hour wait and they were expecting groups of 4. Which sounded plausible until towards the end of our meal a couple seated next to us asked the same thing. Guess what? They were given the exact same response. Hmmmm ... Overall it's pricey, the food is good but they don't ensure everyone gets the same experience. We did not enjoy the night."
Service - Excellent. Decor - Very inviting and nice visual of bar / open kitchen (appetizers only) area. Maboroshi Sake - Crisp in flavor, would highly recommend. Morimoto Junmai Ginjo Sake - Earthy, sweet flavor. Toppogi - GET IT. Korean rice cakes with a thick and sweet coating. How could you go wrong?  Peking Duck - Served in crispy wonton tacos. The sweet chili sauce is different than the typical hoisin sauce that is served with Peking Duck baos. I'd still prefer hoisin. Napa Cabbage - Highly pronounced mustard taste, a bit overwhelming. Tantan - Heavenly. If you love curry, order this and you will not regret it.
I have to say this place is definitely one to avoid. If it started in Astoria, where I grew up, it must not have been good enough to remember or know about it. The owners need to visit bourbon street grill in nyc or Mara homemade in syosset for pointers on food because the menu is extremely light and the food is forgettable. The charbroiled oysters we're over cooked to where they were non-existent and what's up with the bread slices. Filler to make the plate look full. Thank god for bottle of hot sauce. That was the best and added to everything. We then went onto to the pop alligator. Now they must think we are idiots because to find the alligator you had to remove a plateful of potato chips and the alligator looked like it was the crumbs off the hush puppies fried in the seafood oil. They were the size of corn kernels and fried to where you couldn't tell if it was in fact meat. We complained to the waiter who mentioned telling the chef about our concerns but who would expect a microwave to answer. The the voodoo meat loaf with the shrimp etoufee. The meat loaf tasted like it came out of a frozen meat box. Not taste whatsoever. Again the hot sauce to the rescue. The etoufee tasted like it was out of a package. Hardly any shrimp and no taste. We ordered a Po'boy which was nothing fancy. Then came the creole calamari. That was sliced paper thin with more pickled peppers than calamari. Again thanks for the hot sauce. I was looking at the pictures posted on yelp and wish our food came anywhere close to that. For those looking for a Cajun meal just avoid this place even though it looks real nice. On a positive note, in addition to the hot sauce saving the day, the beers were great. Can't mess up that.
I came to this place while looking for a cafe to study. I have been amazed by the general lack of quiet locations in the city, particularly for those of us who study after work (between 6 and 10). This places closes at 11 so I thought, why not? I made to trip to BK and planted myself here.  For one, I will say that the servers are very accomondating and nice, the people are generally pretty quiet, mostly the hipsterish type, and the coffee is certainly digestible (I don't expect much else). The cafe is also pretty secluded since its smack-dab in the middle of Polish Greenpoint, and many of the locals don't exactly care to hang around hipsters. However, the ambient music, while not loud, is certainly irritating when trying to study or think and I am not quite sure why it seems to be a necessity in these places.... I mean, certainly the people are not there for the music. The lighting is also pretty bad (virtually none). Another problem, especially in this time, is the lack of proper air conditioning. It was only a few degrees cooler inside the cafe than outside. Considering the temp has averaged around 85-90 these last few weeks, this is really unbearable.  This review was largely made on the basis of whether or not it is a good place to study, so if you just want to hang around and have fun, this place is fine. The only issue I have is that this is among a number of places that people have recommended for study and I personally cannot. It just does not suite something that requires intense concentration. The place is a bit charming, what with the books and all, but there is nothing to it outside of this. Seating is not that strong and the outside area is close to family homes, with screaming kids and all.  Again, a pretty chill hang out if you are in the neighborhood, but little of anything else.
Went last week on a Monday. We arrived just before 8pm. We were staying at the Westin Times Square and the restaurant was less than a 5 min walk from the hotel. It wasn't too busy. There's not really any seating. The ordering system was interesting. You order and pay in one line. Then you take your ticket to the cooks, choose your tortillas and toppings and wait for them to prepare it. We lucked out because it was not busy when we went. Every other time we passed by there was a line out the door. When we walked it we saw the meat cooking on the giant rotisserie and knew we had to have it. I ordered mine on corn tortillas. It was delicious!!! New York was pretty pricey but Los Tacos prices were very reasonable and definitely worth what we paid. Loved every bite!!
I was super disappointed in this place. I went my first time with a friend a while ago, and was not impressed, but can't remember what I ordered because it was a long time ago and I was more focused on our conversation than the food. But I went back last night. Got a classic burger, fries, their market side which was mexican style corn, and their cocktail of the day, a pear martini. The burger was disgusting. Dry and overcooked, it had the texture of cardboard. The bun was super stale. Maybe it was toasted? But cold and hard. I was starving and looking forward to coming here all day, so it was redeemed by slathering on their beet ketchup and chipotle aioli. Same with the fries. It is really not that hard to get fries right. No flavor, no salt. Just an edible cardboard vessel to shovel in that beet ketchup into your mouth. Market side, the mexican style corn. Just your plain basic corn that had too much spice on it, not enough vegan cheese. Sigh... And that $10 pear martini.... The cup was all ice. It tasted like water. I got like three sips out of it. No flavor. I spent $33 dollars on this meal and was not impressed by ANY of my four items. My the end of my meal, I just felt really full but not satisfied. There were no flavors to really revel in and enjoy. It felt like I was just trying to get the meal over with the entire time I was eating. Luckily their beet ketchup is their savior. C'mon Chloe! I make a better vegan lentil burger than you!! And I am not even vegan!!  If this place was not advertised as vegan, it would go out of business. There is a buzz surrounding this place that I just cannot understand. Their food is not matching the buzz. Sweets By Chloe on the other hand is AMAZING. They are the reason I gave them two stars. Go ahead and get their sweets! Everything is yummy in the bakery. But the food part, run away and save yo cash.
I absolutely loved everything about this place from the start.  It's a charming little spot with a rustic interior/shabby chic interior, and the food is spectacular.  My Father-in-law, Husband, and I split their brunch Mezze Feast, and it was more than enough food - not to mention a fantastic way to sample a lot of their menu.  I've been lobbying them to go back ever since.
I hope this place sticks around because it's an awesome spot! Came here last night and was pleasantly surprised with how good the food was. Arrived at around 7ish and the place was packed! I think we got here at a good time because after we left, there was a good amount people outside waiting for a table.  So glad they had a restaurant week menu because we got to try a couple of things. My fiancé and I got the Polenta Frittata, parmigiana, Margherita pizza and angel and devil pizza. The parmigiana was really good. I'd probably eat a full sized version of it. It's a smoked mozzarella eggplant parm that comes in a small bowl. Definitely try this! The polenta fries were pretty good. It comes with a blue cheese sauce that I wasn't particularly fond of because I'm not a fan of blue cheese.  The Margherita pizza was good. There was a good ratio of dough, cheese and sauce. Probably could've use a touch more basil, but that because I LOVE basil.  The Angel and Devil pizza was my favorite. It hits you with sweet, spicy and salty all in one bite. It's probably not the kind of pizza you'd want to take out because it got a little soggy probably from the honey.  Got the Soleluna sangria which was tasty. Not too sweet.  And then for desert our guy gave us a chocolate chip cannoli and profiteroles. The cannoli was standard but the profiteroles were amazing. I think it had a nuttela cream filling inside. It was light and not too sweet!  I really only had one complaint about the service. Don't get me wrong, everyone is really nice and friendly!  It was a bit annoying when they gave you the next  course. They would forget to clear our plates before bringing the next dish. So we'd find ourselves scrambling to find space. Oh and topping up our water. But I know they are new, so I'm willing to give them another chance. Regardless of that, I will still come back because the food was amazing. Mirsad(sp?), the guy at the bar was super friendly and really took care of us! This is honestly a great addition to the neighborhood!
Finding Despana was a complete fluke. I got hungry, whipped out my iPhone, accessed Yelp and Despana topped the list. Given I was overjoyed to eat at someplace with a Spanish flair as I love the cuisine and Despana was not a disappointment.  Service was a bit dismissive but that just might be the NY attitude.  The food was great and I would highly recommend this place
I came on a Friday night knowing that this place gets packed fast, but still got seated within 15 minutes! The food overall was great, everything we had was up to expectations. I definitely recommend the duck breast, it was cooked extremely well and was filled with flavor! Although I came with my cousin, it's a nice place to take a girl on a date. Our server was very attentive and paid full attention to us, I never had to ask for water once throughout the whole dinner.
I live in the East Village and had a bbq craving so I thought I'd give it a shot. Positives- the corn fritters (not the sauce) were good. The bun didn't seem stale. Negatives: the sauce with the fritters tastes like regular honey, no balance of acidity or spice. The coleslaw, which is described as 'creamy', was either not dressed properly for my tiny portion or they have redefined creamy as 'raw cabbage with a fistful of black pepper'. The pickling solution for the onions also seems off, they are really sour in a medicinal, cough drop kind of way. Yuck. And the meat, if we can call it that, again better described as 'gummy ball of fat'. I had the brisket which is in weird globs which I had to pick apart to find any meat within the fatty mess. Even the bbq sauce itself, which comes in individual containers, is weirdly sour. Something is wrong with all of the formulas. I don't think I'd give MQ's another shot even if it was cheap. And it is not cheap. A gross sandwich which I had to dissect, and didn't enjoy any for their individual flavors, and a small side with a sauce that made said side more like a dessert, ran me over 15 dollars. Never again.
"WARNING.  If this restaurant pushed me around; your next.  Regular customer. Probably dine at sister restaurant  Quality Meats Once every 10 days.  But that didn't stop the 22 year old ""manager"" from interrupting a 350 dollar meal in progress to tell me...and I am not kidding here..to return to my seat and not sit next to my date...not because the couple next to us complained, but because I violated some ridiculous unwritten policy of the ""manager"" not to have people sit next to each other at a deuce table.  So, I did what any red blooded American would do: I told them to stick the rest of the meal, that I would be moving down the street to the 2 star Michelin Marea where I was guaranteed to be treated w dignity and respect, and I walked out   Unbelievable: even when given the last opportunity to do the right thing, the 2 adolescent ""Managers""'doubled down and made it infinitely worse and lost not just this customer but ALL my friends family co-workers acquaintances and clients FOR LIFE.  nice job, QI."
There's something very enjoyable about eating here.  This is a special occasion place that exhibits this not in it's prim and proper white tablecloths, but in its unique singularity.  This is an experience.  The steak had a wonderful beefy flavor - you're not getting aged funk (which I love), you're getting amplified beef (doused in butter).  The bacon is good - but the best part is the pool of fat left behind to sop up with your bread, it really is a pronounced, smoky pork flavor.   The apple strudel was a perfect end to our night - warm, flaky crust and a mountain of schlag (into which I might have dipped a few of the finishing gold chocolate coins).  I loved our waiter.  It felt like we were being guided by a grizzled, seasoned vet - more in touch with the ebbs and flows of Luger's than we could ever be.  Last thing - a 5 year old was celebrating her birthday one table over and I hope to god my kid is that cool one day.
We had an amazing time at Scarpetta tonight. We had the most amazing waitress (Lizzie?) and other waiters whom I wish I had their names. Great service, delicious food, great ambiance. I'll warn you now, small dishes at big prices, but what else do you expect. Good part about that is you can enjoy 4 courses and not leave feeling thanksgiving day stuffed... I will be back again!
This Place has the best oven bricked pizza I've had so far, I loved the thin chewy crust, its  perfectly marinated on top and has fresh flavors. I love a pizza that seems so basic, but yet has good quality toppings and texture. Very hipster environment, you can dine in or take out. It also has 2 bars you can order drinks including wine.
Cafe Habana is located in the Nolita area, a little northeast of Chinatown (easiest way to get there is to take the N to Prince St and walk east several blocks). It's a small Cuban restaurant that has tight limited seating but a great ambiance, and the servers are upbeat and polite.  We started out with some cheese corn, where they cover two corn cobs on a stick with Parmesan cheese and some sort of spice. If you've never had it before I would recommend trying it. It costs ~$7.50, so a little pricier than the $3 corn cobs that you can get at street tents during the summer all over NY, but then again it probably tastes better too. For the entree I got the carne asada (pork) tacos, they were fantastic. Just ask for and add some hot sauce to spice up the flavor. Comes with rice and beans as well.
The new space is huge, so it can easily accommodate big groups. However, if you're going for tasty food, you might want to head elsewhere. The paella was so bad, especially for $58. I don't think broccoli ever belongs in paella. The rice was mushy and flavorless.  The seafood pancake was mushy in the middle. The asparagus fries were like $8 for 4 pieces!! The only dish I remember liking was the galbi sliders.  Our server also did not bring us a beer or tacos we ordered. But they left that off of the check at least, so we didn't bother correcting them.
The experience here was horrendous. The staff was incredibly rude and made us feel extremely uncomfortable. My fiancé's luggage had been lost during our flight to New York, so he only had more casual attire for brunch. Because of this they sat us at the back of the restaurant instead of where I had reserved by the window. Mind you I had called several weeks in advance for our reservations.  My fiancé is a very positive person, so even after the host rudely told us his attire was not good enough for the window seats, he was optimistic about the food. That being said, every plate we had was awful.  I had the scallop appetizer that was at best a 4 out of 10 with 1 being the worst and 10 being the best. The bread that was served was cold and the butter was frozen. Our entrees were so bland that we sent them back immediately. We paid the check and left without a word.  My advice as a successful business owner is to focus on your food and less on what your customers are wearing.  P.s. My fiancés is highly successful and we left paying a 200+ bill for food we did not eat and walked down the street to a coffee shop and grabbed coffee and bagels. Much better than the overly pretentious restaurant with nothing to back its image.
We came to New York seeking Pizza and Pastrami.  Lombardi's got my choice as our first pizza stop. Their history is great, their location good, and the write-ups are decent. I ordered a pepperoni pizza, the old timeless classic.  My opinions: the crust was fantastic. Easily the best part. The cheese was very unevenly applied even given the margarita style of the pizza. I would have far preferred a plain-old cheese pizza covered in Buffalo Mozzarella, but they wouldn't do it. The tomato sauce, of which there was too much, was too acidic. The attached picture shows this pretty clearly.  And, just to wrap up, the pepperonis were the tiny kind, where I prefer the larger slices.  The Caesar salad was ok, and the dressing homemade. Overall, they seem to be getting by more on their reputation and history rather than their pizza. The price they charge for the pizza is 2x or 3x the normal price for a similar pie.
Who doesn't love and appreciate a quality cuban? Like all good NY establishments, this place is tiny, packed with tables, packed with humans, and full of character and charm. If you don't feel like waiting, plan to arrive just after the lunch rush. Last time I left at 2-3pm and there were plenty of seats. Well, not plenty. But seats!
After the dinner experience we just had, I was positive we must have walked into a different Gallitos than the one with nearly a perfect score on Yelp.  It seemed okay going in but perhaps I should have been a little wary that there were only 4 tables of people on a Saturday night when every other place had a wait. The menu had some interesting entree options along with the typical quesadilla and taco  options...but no burritos...which was fine since I was more in the entree mode (I was disappointed to see no mole option as that is often my litmus test for a place the strives beyond  tacos).   They don't have a full liquor license so we went for Negra Modela and the coconut sangria (which was fantastic and by far the highlight of the meal).  We had ordered the guac appetizer but it failed to ever be delivered although they did bring chips and salsa (which can be relatively rare to get for free these days). The chips were solid but the salsa was very mediocre and tasted like jarred rather than fresh (it had a heavy canned tomato taste).  We would have mentioned the missing guac (and ordered more drinks) but our waiter was too busy chatting in back to ever check in on us.   The nail on the coffin for us were the entrees.  The chicken enchiladas were flavorless with incredibly dry chicken and chewy tortilla.  Dumping the remainder of the salsa on top helped a little but shouldn't have been required in first place. The quesadilla was okay but more what you expect in a bar than actual Mexican restaurant. The pork chop just didn't really fit in in a Mexican restaurant and was just a slab of meat on top of comical mountain of squash.  With so many waaaaaaay better option these days we are certainly never going back
Disappointed. Went based on the stars. Food menu was limited, food was subpar and expensive and it was extremely hot inside like the air was not on or not working. 5/28/17
What a nice place! It's pretty much 3 places in 1.  There's the restaurant, there's an outdoor patio with music and bars and there's a small take out shop.  All 3 have different entrances. The ambience of the restaurant is very good, nice music, good service and of course the pizza is extremely good.  I had the Famous Original and the Bee Sting.  Both were very good, I prefer the Bee Sting though.  For appetizer I had the cheese plate which was very good too. One of the best pizza places in the city, no doubt!
My new favorite Malaysian restaurant in NYC (sorry Malay Restaurant on 44th Rd in Flushing, which is even 2 doors down from a parking garage whose price is a fraction of what it costs to park in a lot near S. Street Seaport, where one may otherwise end up parking far away; or better yet, take the train); they are just doing everything right, and all their food is on point.   AND whole steamed lobsters are $15 every Mon. and Tue, and a dozen oysters are $12.......and full bar, and super friendly staff....keep it up ......  ....& any restaurant owners with bad reviews reading this who by any chance don't know why their reviews are bad, please come here and see what hospitality and good food feel and taste like - !
I loved this place. I am a huge west coast oyster fan, and this NYC place had everything I was hoping for. I got the fettuccine too, which was great! I was really thrilled with the service and environment. Beer selection was also great. Very laid back and trendy dinner spot. Will be back!
"I live in NYC and had been to this place before and liked it. So when my family was visiting from Colorado I thought it would be a great choice. Since we would be 7 people I called the restaurant after not being able to book on open table. Over the phone I explained that we would have 7 people and asked if that would be a problem. I was told it would be fine, that ""we seat tables of 7 all the time"" and as long as it wasn't peak time 8pm there shouldn't be an issue. We got there at 7 (early by NYC dinner standards) and were ignored for several minutes by 2 hosts/hostesses. Then the rude hostess told my aunt ""I can't help you"" not, the wait time will be... nope. I told her what I had been told over the phone and she replied that the wait would be an hour and a half. I pointed out that there are too many Mexican places nearby for me to ever eat there again. Eff that place and that woman's attitude."
Ordered beef noodle soup and pan fried buns. The soup lacked any flavor besides msg. The noodles were soggy, and the meat was rubbery. The buns took forever to come to our table. They were not worth the wait. The buns didn't have a lot of stuffing and were too oily.
I don't understand their service. The poker face lady is dropping everything on our table without apology. Seriously no matter how good the food is it was totally ruined by her. Won't come here anymore.
"Definitely get a reservation before coming here - even on a Sunday night! It was packed.  The food was pretty good. I started with the dumplings and had the ""burger"" (they use english muffins instead of traditional buns) as my entree. Both were extremely delicious; the fries were perfectly crispy (albeit very greasy, but hey, you can't have it both ways).  I missed out on having any cocktails this time around, but I'll be back to try their extensive and famous cocktail list!!  The only thing I have to say is that the service needs some work? I was excited b/c a lot of the reviews here say that the service is very memorable and helped to shape their experience at Bea; but my server checked in on us once, never made conversation, and didn't seem to really give a hoot about our meal."
"Solid Bobby Flay tapas in a classy yet casual setting.  The food is solid but didn't stand out as much as I had anticipated although there were definitely some standouts (soft shell crab, scrambled eggs, and the crispy potatoes) .  Service is very attentive for sure. Some highlights: 1. Kale & mushroom paella: This was flavorful but very salty and the rice itself was on the al dente side.  This is the signature dish but felt a bit like a let-down. 2. Pork chop: This was cooked perfectly with a creamy side of polenta.  The jus was flavorful and savory.  While this was certainly very good, it didn't stand out flavor-wise from similar Niman pork chops in other restaurants of the same caliber. 3. Soft shell crab: Tiny portion but the dish itself was superb.  The tarragon broth was savory and a great dip for the accompanying bread. 4. Charred beef: Cooked to a tender medium rare and incredibly flavorful.  The farro side was pretty meh but meat was definitely the highlight. 5.Grilled octopus: Very flavorful but a bit tougher than expected.  Solid but not a match for Lupa's version. 6. Cauliflower: Roasted perfectly but the glaze was sweeter than expected. 7. Potatoes: Served with a soft-boiled egg and crispy potatoes.  Very good. 8. Scrambled eggs: Amazing.  The accompanying toast is a bit too greasy but the eggs themselves are savory and light. 9. Greek salad: Very small but a very solid and delicately prepared version of a classic.  One of the few ""light"" dishes on the menu. 10. Eggplant: Tender and very flavorful.  It's one bite but a delicious one. 11. Crispy polenta: Good balanced bite of ricotta and pesto.   12. Lamb tenderloin: Tender and flavorful.  It's a tiny portion but the meat is done well. 13. Greek yogurt panna cotta: Slightly tart take on a classic.  Served with peaches.  It's solid but definitely more tart than the standard take.  The almond brittle is a nice topping, though. 14. Pistachio lemon olive oil cake: Fluffy yet dense cake with the perfect mesh of flavors.  Very good. 15. Chocolate polenta cake: The whipped ricotta topping is delish and pairs perfectly with the cocoa and hzelnuts.  Very solid."
Such a shame that they are only getting two stars from me because the food was really good.  We traveled pretty far to come here too! The restaurant is super small so things are kind of unorganized and cramped with the ordering line. You start by telling them what size you want then they pass you down the line and each person behind the counter adds things to your dish.  We decided on a burrito and just needed a second to see if we were gonna split one or each get our own the girl who was helping was SO unnecessarily rude toward us. She rushed the shit out of us and pushed us forward practically before we were even decided. The next kid was the same way. Just short spoken and rude and not exactly willing to explain things to us.  Like I said the joint is so teeny and there is literally just 4 seats available. Didn't think that one through much did they?  Despite the shitty service and anything else the food was honestly bomb. We loaded our burritos up and whatever you want to add doesn't cost any extra so that's cool. Be careful when you eat it though because they have no bottoms since the seaweed wraps are square and not circles lmao.  May or may not come back.
Echoing Aphrodite35's review from March 4. I've stopped going to Glady's recently for a couple of reasons: 1. Food quality has gone downhil and is more inconsistent. The last time I got jerk chicken, the skin was completely burnt to a crisp, and there was only a tiny amount of meat (mostly gristle and bone). When I get lucky and the food is well prepared, it is still delicious. This, however, rarely happens these days. 2. Prices rose by a dollar across the board at the beginning of the year. I understand prices go up, but it reached a threshold for me where it wasn't worth it (especially when more issues like #1 above kept happening). Chicken went from $9 to $10, which would be fine if the quality was still good. Meanwhile, sides like bok choy and rice+peas went from $3 to $4. $4 is too much for how little food is in these simple dishes.
"So I'm a New Yorker - it takes a bit to impress me. BUT, with that said, I wanted to try Grand Banks after seeing pics of the food & view. LOCATION - along the Hudson River Park with great views of Manhattan (west side view) and Jersey City/Hoboken.  THE BOAT - from what I heard it's small. And yes it is. Okay fine, that I don't mind. We waited about 30 mins to be seated for brunch (more of a lunch since there is no brunch menu and no brunch specials) and had a drink at the bar. Unfortunately, weather was shitty at that time and the boat was rocking pretty hard at some points. Definitely DONT get drunk on that boat lol.  The people - Non new Yorkers, Hampton/Connecticut/Massachusetts boat shoe wearing people. Just an observation.   FOOD - Their menu is limited to about 8 or 9 things but I've seen some instagram pics of their ""Best Lobster Roll in America"" and I immediately wanted to try this place. Not going to lie, the Lobster roll was pretty fkn good. The lobster was in chunks, and seasoned perfectly. BUT not filling at all. The seasoned chips they gave, out lasted the lobster roll and the slaw on the side was the size of one of those ketchup cups you get at Wendy's. $27 worth? No thanks.  My friend wanted to get the scallop ceviche but the waiter informed her it was a bite size plate to share. Literally was. About 12 slivers of bite size avocado with bite size scallops. Worth $18? ha. So she also got the burrata for $16. PRICE - Not worth it. For a New Yorker's standard anyway. You are paying for Location, Location, Location. How is that even a brunch? 3 small plates for $80. OVERALL - for that price, or a few dollars more, I had food that filled me up. Eh, worth the try but I wont be back."
Sober or drunk, you'll enjoy this place.  As I took a bite of the breakroom fries, I just knew that this was going to be good. I ordered the breakroom fries, breakroom burger, and the tempura fish tacos. MY FAVORITE were the fish tacos hands down. A must! And the fries were super heavy but delicious (make sure you share). And I'd probably pass on the burger next time, it was alright. Not a fan of the bun.  Side note: Seating can be limited so go early or at an awkward time. I also didn't see a bathroom but never bothered to ask - this place is tiny but it surprisingly had a decent amount of seats. And yes, they have hand sanitizer at the cashier area.
Delicious drinks and food!  Came here for a double date and loved the atmosphere! The food was delicious and the drinks were SO GOOD! I had the market fish and everything was sautéed to perfection. Highly recommend!
This place is just plain good. Everything you'd expect in a midtown pub and more. The drinks are my favorite thing here. If you come when it's not crowded (better come really early) the bartenders will explain how each drink was created. The drink menu is super imaginative. The drinks are really great. If you don't understand what's in the drink, ask the servers because they are knowledgeable and friendly, always. The food is good. I love the flatbread and the lamb sliders but I haven't really had anything I didn't like. It's slightly too loud, but not unbearable. So, feel free to come  here. You won't feel cheated by some tourist trap and you'll def enjoy the food and drinks.
This place made me a believer in wine flights. I honestly don't even know if there's a benefit to even doing a beer flight now. From 4-7pm, you can sample three wines from a list of almost 30 wine options for only $12!  What a steal!  Looking at the picture, it seems like the wines come in mini wine glasses that might be equivalent to one or one and a half glasses of wine. Let me tell you, you will most definitely be getting three standard glasses of wine. So worth the value! If you are looking to try out different wines, I really recommend this spot. I saw a few dinner plates going out and they all left me salivating, so I personally can't wait to go back for the food. Food or not, this spot reigns supreme in terms of wine happy hours for me.  Just get there early because seating is scarce!
This place is worth the hype, and those words don't come lightly to me. The ambiance and service was top-notch, and the food was amazing. My husband and went big on the pasta - we ordered three, and they were all out of this world. We also got that amazing mushroom and fried egg appetizer, which was also amazing. We ordered the olive oil cake too, and I was depressed that I was too full to eat it.
I got food poisoning from this place! I boarded my flight right after I ate and an hour later I was in the bathroom vomiting my brains out.
Prepare to wait! There is always a wait here. 50% because the food is good and 50% because of the instagram pictures haha. Burger could use a lot of work - very sub par but the breakfast items are delicious.
Since I missed out on checking Ippudo when I was in Japan, my trip to NY was the perfect opportunity to give this place a try. We got there at 2:30pm on a Saturday, and the wait was still 30 minutes.  When we finally got seated, we ordered our noodles. I had the original since I expected the original to be the best. The ramen and broth was decent, but nothing spectacular to write home about. The broth was a bit flat in flavor and just lacked something. I still like Ichiran better.
Toloache is a great little spot in Midtown. The food is delicious, but definitely overpriced. I used to live in the Midtown area and would get take out from Toloache a bunch. The chips and salsa are really delicious and a must get even if you are doing take out. This place is definitely upscale and good.
"Attempted coming here the first time on a Friday and got there too late (around 8PM). Expected wait was 2 hours. Tried again another week (group of 2) and arrived at 7PM. This time was only 20 minute wait.  It's a cozy, dark interior with a ""standing area"" by the bar. So you can order drinks and wait inside for your table if you want. Cute idea having book covers as menus (esp the Mulan one). I opted not to have an adult Capri sun drink just because I knew they wouldn't be boozy enough for me. Add more alch and I'll try one next time. Not gonna pay for a lit ice cube in a dark room but they look fun. In ranking from best to not bad, but not best: Steak with feta and kale: lawd have mercy cause the steak was so tender, tasty sweet sauce on top. The feta tasted more like cheesy heaven on earth mashed potatoes. Kale was also superb Gnocchi: basically Italian gnocchi meets Korean ddukbokki with some cauliflower and bit of cheese that you mix up real well and shove in your mouth. Effing noms! Angry sweet potatoes: you don't find out why it's angry until you've eaten the fifth wedge and your mouth is now on fire because you just ate the spicy gnocchi.  Eel taco: I personally like eel and thought it was super tender and flavorful. Combined with all the other add ons, it was just a mouthful of tastiness in each bite. Tuna tataki: nice quality tuna cooked well and nice sauce but the flavors of the other tapas ... it's hard to compete with! Really enjoyed the tapas and the effort of the service to explain each dish to you. The dishes were just super tasty and well executed all around. I will be back to try the rest!"
Eep... ordered delivery via seamless. Food is pretty good but by the time I got to the bottom of my salad... I realized the paper they lined it with had melted and/or got way too soggy and made its way into my food :( I ate a bit of paper tonight - thanks for the extra not delicious fiber.  Please fix how you box takeaways and you'll get 4-5 stars for the food!
i had such high expectations for this place.  the restaurant had all the tables super close to each other, and felt like i didnt have much personal space. but the environment seems like i was transported back 40 or more years ago and went to a steakhouse back then. i love how there is a private free parking lot for the restaurant right across it a block away.  very convenient if you are driving in from out of town.  we had made reservations a month in advance for a late lunch, and they sat us perfectly on time.  we ordered the steak for 2 (got it medium rare.  came out sizzling HOT. but the steak was way undercooked for us.  it was more of a rare, and mooing state that when we cut it with our knife, it didn't cut up.  it was pretty good though!  been to many steak houses, but this restaurant didnt give us a special reason to come back again), creamed spinach (not a huge creamed spinach fan, but the only side they had that I would order was this dish.  it was super creamy, and really delicious, so i highly recommend if you do actually like creamed spinach!), and the french fries for 2 (THE BEST. BOMB. i LOVE fries and their fries are super thick but CRISPY. like the best combo and the best of both worlds as a fry, thick and crispy. it wasnt soggy at all.  i would be able to eat multiple plates of the fries LOL highly recommend as a side).  the bread that comes in the beginning complimentary were delicious, with that fresh block of butter, it was amazing.  and a glass of wine and beer was super refreshing to pair with the steak. service here is A.  they are super attentive and accommodating.  and the chocolate coin at the end is bomb LOL ALSO. CASH ONLY HERE OR DEBIT CARD ONLY OR CHECK.
more like 3.5 stars food i got a small margherita pizza it was oversauced which i did not dig i did like the crush though and yes i was able to eat the whole thing on my own price they are cash only and they dont sell by slice. the small pizza was 20 bucks. umm that is ridiculous, they are jacking it up for not all that. being a historic pizzeria i do get it but come on service guy at the desk was a bit of a jerk but its nyc so it comes with the turf, hey i made a rhyme!! parking none, zero, zilch, nada overall, glad i tried it. i dont think id come back here though
If you're looking for a delicious, upscale Italian experience, I wholeheartedly recommend Scarpetta.  Hubby and I came here for our last fine dining meal in NYC, and it was definitely an awesome way to end our trip. We were going to do the tasting menu but decided against it, then proceeded to pretty much order everything that was on the tasting menu .. Oh well, we were so happy with our food, that it didn't really matter. Started with the Polenta with Wild Mushroom Fricassee and the Short Rib Farro Risotto.  Oh. My. Goodness.  Talk about fancy comfort food.  This had all the decadence and indulgence you could ever ask for, but it wasn't overwhelming or overpowering at the least.  It was straight heaven plain and simple. Hubby ended up with the Branzino for his entrée which I did not try.  He loved it, but I can't really attest to it.  However, I went for classic Italian - the Spaghetti with Basil.  I can't imagine coming here and not trying something like this.  Perfectly made pasta, delicious robust sauce.  Not too much on the plate (because who wants to get miserably full this early on?); it was the right amount.  It was just delicious and I'm very happy I ordered it. On dessert, my husband was just okay about it.  He got the Limoncello Semifreddo.  It came with a basil berry gelato and pistachio cake.  I took a bite and I liked it just fine, so It was probably just a preference issue for him.  I had the crème fraiche cheesecake with a praline gelato and pear compote and I absolutely loved it.  Perfect ending to what I consider a perfect meal. We would definitely go back to Scarpetta.  The only thing we'd do is request a table in the restaurant itself, as we were seated in the bar area up front which was rather crowded.  My seat was right next to the water station, so it wasn't the most ideal.  But there were so many delicious things I wanted to try on the menu, that I'd do this again for sure.
"My fetching wife and I have tried previously about two years ago to get in. Weather and hunger drove us to a terrible substitute if this [in retrospect].  I am not sure I can explain the super awesomeness of Ippudo. Let me try... First - operationally - wow - genius - this might as well be a modern factory as far as production- the food is prepared identically every time. The service effort is shared equally. We sat at the bar and they even had previously prepared ""setups"" ready under the counter. Now for the part you probably care about - the food. Ramen - done right.  Internet that this place has so stayed true. For example there is no chicken base in it, for the faint at heart. But there is a bold vegetarian option, which my omnivorous wife adored and finished every bite and sup! Suggestion try the boiled spiced egg, soft boiled, egg for your ramen bowl. Wow!!! What else can be said? You tell me when you go!"
The food was tasty but the portions were tiny and not worth the money. We also waited a really long time for our food and it wasn't crowded at all.
Yelp can you please allow us to give negative ratings? I was completely insulted before even having a chance to sit down at this place. I heard such amazing things about this place but after this experience I don't know if could ever try it again.  I walked over with a friend to this place which was located in a residential area. I was so excited because I love finding hidden gems in the neighborhood. We walked in and saw people sitting at the bar, bartenders making drinks, wait staff sitting around and people in the back of the restaurant at tables. Everyone looked up at us and just went back to what they were doing, no acknowledgement. We stood there at the door for about a couple minutes trying to be patient and then I had to ask if we could get a table for lunch. The hostess just looked at me and said we don't open for another 5 minutes and gestures us towards the door. I looked at her confused since there were people already in the restaurant. I said okay we can come back no problem! Stepped out the door and she locked the door behind me and closed the shade!  I understand that if they were not open yet but if there were people in there already why not just offer is to wait to the side or wait at the bar? I was in shock. No customer service!!!! Good may be great but just because of this experience it's not worth trying.
"We paid decent money for  a ""just hmmm..."" experience.  I brought my grandmother, mom, husband and baby to this place expecting an exceptional or at least lovely time. It wasn't a horrible time but it certainly didn't win me over enough to want to come back.  We booked an early dinner because I know how many people feel about babies, and when we arrived at 5 on Tuesday we were certainly the only ones for a good 45 minutes. And then only one of three parties till dessert.  We got placed in the back area which was beautiful. I had told them we were a party of 5 and in the notes of OpenTable mentioned 4 adults plus baby in a stroller. In hindsight, the very back table was probably a bad bad idea because it made it difficult to leave when people started to come in. And boy are the other dining clientele elitist because they roasted us with evil stares and were slow to move when my husband asked them to shimmy over so we could exit.  But the 'tude isn't the restaurant's fault... Just our placement. Hmm... When we sat to look at menus, the waiter failed to mention specials. I had to ask for them and then he just kind of motioned to the wall. Hmm...  No explanations. He also didn't introduce himself nor offer up the prix fixe menus till asked.  When the food arrived they didn't really remember who had what app or main. They also didn't remember when I mentioned certain desserts or apps were to be shared so extra silverware and plates had to be got the second round. Remember, we were the ONLY guests until the mains first arrived. Hmm... This all made gone on a lot longer than necessary. Water didn't materialize quick enough either. No offers on refills for wine or drinks.  The food itself was fine. But just fine. Cheese plate had five cheeses but they cut the parmiggiano in 2 ways to make it look different. Eh. I would have preferred another cheese. They also didn't explain what cheese was what... Beet soup was decent. Salad was fine. The halibut was a touch overcooked. The ragu was ok. The ravioli was nicely al dente but the sauce was tired. I could barely taste the sage. Mom was happy enough with her salmon. Dessert was fine but took foreeeevvveerrrr. Portions were good. Overall we were okay with everything but I really felt like we could have made this meal at home.  So Barbalu it was nice to meet you but we'll forever part ways. There's just so many other places to try."
"The food is mediocre and the portions are tiny, but at least the service is atrocious to keep you entertained. Walked in here at 10PM on a whim. When I asked for a seat, I was immediately told that the sushi counter was closed, and that I couldn't get fish. OK...it's an ""izakaya"", so I wouldn't ordinarily get sushi, but I guess that means no fish at all? Hard to say. Anyway, half of the menu is unavailable at 10PM. So we're off to a good start. I ordered 5 different skewers and a beer to start, thinking, again, that this is an izakaya. They go away, and come back five minutes later to tell me that they've run out of prawns and chicken skin. That's like Starbucks running out of coffee, but whatever. I have a beer in my hand now, so I guess I'll stick it out. Roughly 15 minutes later I get my first skewer -- and that's skewer, singular, because for $7, that's what you get: one sad little skewer of meat. But at least there are some picked carrots...oh, wait, nevermind. He just took the plates away without asking, so I didn't get to try those. Asshole. All told, for four skewers and a beer, I paid $28, before tip. That's ridiculous. I walked out, went across the street to the BBQ place, and paid $19 for a full meal. Avoid this place."
On the recommendation of a colleague my favorite foodie and I made reservations here for brunch. 4 stars for ambience. Took off 1 star because some tables are to low. But having said that amazing views, decor and service. Food is 5 star delicious. Portions are on the smaller side but filling. We had the quiche and the egg spinach Florentine goat cheese Benedict with avocado (like butter) and chicken sausage sides. Mimosas were flowing and leave room for dessert- you won't be disappointed. We shared the special; a fresh raspberry filled donut(s) topped off with chocolate.  Do make reservations esp. If you want sit outside. Great date venue. Nice for cocktails and watching NY views.
Ratchaburi crab and pork dry noodles-good. Well seasoned and chewy handmade egg noodles. Average quality of lean pork slices. Small chunks of real crab meat that's not very fresh. Steamed baby bok choy. Mango sticky rice-absolutely delicious. The best I have ever had. Ripe fresh mango on top of warm sticky rice in a layer of white coconut juice. Sweet with a hint of salt and sprinkles of white sesame.
"Well I was really excited to see that the old ""Station"" was reopening and excited to have a new chef and manager.  My son and I order the Stuffed Shishito Peppers, they sounded it great on the menu and is one of my favorites.  However, the pepers came out look warm temperature wise and they had absolutely no flavor whats so ever.  They didn't even put some salt on them.  My son ordered the Mac and Cheese, which is one of his favorite dishes.   Needles to say he was quite dissapointed and was I.  They used very large shells and it was as dry as could be.  I mean they either over cooked it to the point all the cheese dried up or they just don't know how to make the dish.  Finally, I got the brick oven chicken.  I've had then many of times at various other restaurants and am a big fan of it.  Mine came out a little above luke warm.   There was great flavor, but most of the white meat part was overly dried out.   And with it only coming out warm it didn't excite my taste buds. So I have to say i was dissapointed with Station and now the chef of this place seems to have followed suite. I gave ti 2 stars because the service was really good and the atmosphere inviting and relaxing."
Eh. I probably went at the worst time possible: came here for Sunday brunch, waited like 40 minutes, was crammed into a table at a far corner. The place is not big to begin with, but it was so crowded and unbelievably loud, everyone at the table had to yell to hear each other. The food was pretty ordinary too. Not bad of a deal ($15 for a brunch dish) but the taste was was neither fantastic nor memorable. Nothing terrible happened, but the overall experience wasn't positive. There are so many better places in the city for brunch.
Love and hate Astoria Seafood. Fresh, healthy, and decently priced. The seafood and their many side dishes are simple and yet remarkably tasty. BYOB and any meal here would make for a perfect summer day in Astoria.  As others have already pointed out, however, the service is inconsistent and unnecessarily chaotic. I give you money; you give me food. That's how this is supposed to work, right? I've come here on a number of occasions and had a decent experience, and I've also been confused and ignored by the employees while I waited an extra 30 mins for a small order while the stream of people who arrived after me and ordered after me have come and gone. To top it off, the older man at the cash register then hit on me as I was asking him to check on my order. So gross. As a local and a seafood lover, I want to like this neighborhood establishment so badly. Customer service, however, does not seem like a priority, and I'd rather spend money where customers are respected.
Agree with the recent reviews - my ponzu salmon bowl was bland, the salmon itself very flavorless, and the shredded shiso leaf all over it became the flavor of the meal. The rice was disappointing - it tasted barely seasoned and again, bland, but at least it wasn't dry! They sprinkled tempura flakes all over, which added to the visual appeal but really didn't contribute to flavor, I didn't like their taste. For the price paid, so not satisfactory.
I'm not in the habit of writing bad reviews and before I wrote this I checked to see if i was being unreasonable.  It seems I'm not.  Nothing good to say here at all.  We arrived early in the evening and it was very quiet.  After scanning the menu and not being inspired, our initial thoughts were to up and leave.   We stayed.  Big mistake.  We decided on a 'safe' Indonesian favorite - Nasi Goreng.   Terrible.  Ingredients seemed fresh enough.   Rice under cooked and there was no flavor to speak of.   Offered no condiments.   Not even salt and pepper in sight.  Chili sauce MAY have saved it.   We stuck to the water.   Cheapest bottle of wine was $38!! Add tax and tip you're looking at min of $49.   For a little shop front restaurant in Greenpoint!! .  Seriously !  This place won't last.    Did I mention the staff ?  Nowhere in sight.  Stayed out the back the entire time.   It was they were embarrassed to be around the food.   And of course we were not asked ' how was it ' !!!!
This is a common spot for many to start pregaming before the night festivities. The chicken is super good and crispy and it's very common for me to come here with a group of friends and over order so BEWARE.  The reason why I'm not the biggest fan of this place is that its SUPER LOUD. A dining experience with friends, with good drinks, with korean fried chicken is to engage in social activity with one another. However the music at this place is insanely loud where I have to strain my voice (I speak very loudly) to get the person next to me to ACTUALLY hear what I'm saying. I hope management sees this review and will adjust accordingly.
Terrible service, waited forever to give order, then forever to wait for the first course, finally an incomplete first course came. I put an (apparently) steamed muscle in my mouth and they were stone cold, the shell was actually frigid so yup, muscles that were stone cold. I left. I refuse to pay such high prices for bad service and cold steamed muscles. Never again.Sadly, this is the second time I have been here and the second time I have had desperately bad service - shame, if done well the food is very good - but when you give a place a second chance based on the tastiness of the food and boom - right off the (slow) bat your served an incomplete, cold order - then shame on you if you ever return.
"A girlfriend and I heard ""rave reviews"" about the ramen and so we called it ""girls night out"". Arrived during their second half (5:30 to be exact) and there was already a good line of locals waiting for the restaurant to open. You're probably thinking, as we did ""that's a good sign"" (rolls eyes).    We decided on ordering the salt and pepper chicken wings; which were a recommendation by our server. SALTY, lacked seasoning, pretty tough to bite into. Yes, it was crunchy, but that's the only thing it had going for them. One star at best! Ramen: I ordered the pork bone, roasted pork, extra noodles, garlic oil and my friend had the same broth, but with spicy ground pork, minus the mushrooms. We both expressed the same sentiments about the ramen as a whole. Broth was not all that flavorful. Serious lacking that depth of flavor that one typically expects from Ramen. We found ourselves adding in all our chili oil for more flavoring. My roasted pork was rather bland and very fatty. Noodles never seemed to soften up. Weird texturally in comparison to other noodles we have both had. Extra noodles became congealed like and made the soups temperature drop.    Service was pretty good.  Overall: Really wanted to love this place. Don't be fooled by pictures or reviews for that matter."
I came here after I picked up my boyfriend from the airport and this was just the kind of food he needed after a long airplane ride.  For starters, we got the steamed crabmeat & pork xiao long bao ($6.95) and the scallion pancake with sliced beef ($4.95). The XLB was on the pricier side since you can get high-quality XLB for a cheaper price at Joe's Shanghai as well. But if that's what Nan Xiang is known for, then what the heck. The soup dumplings came in a steaming hot bamboo bowl. There was a lot of soup inside, though not as much as Joe's. However, the soup base was rich and the meat was tender. The scallion pancake was more on the reasonable end of the price spectrum. The pancakes were really crispy and the beef was nice and chewy. Besides their top notch XLB, I would also recommend getting the beef & chili pepper noodle soup ($7.95) and the Shanghai pan fried udon ($6.95). They're both really tasty and they come in big portions as well.
After a couple more conversations on the phone, I finally got my refund for the extra charge... Sloppy, but at least they care about customer service
Decent Italian food at an affordable price.  The fried calamari was bland.  The burrata was tasty, and came in a very generous portion.  I had the squid ink pasta with calamari which was good but not great - I can make better.  My dinner mates reported similar feelings about their pasta dishes.  The salmon was well executed, albeit a bit small.  The ambiance is good, although it's a bit hard to hear.  The service is average.  I think the meal came to about $30 per person for appetizers, dinner and coffee, without drinks.  Overall, I had a perfectly enjoyable meal but wouldn't recommend it or go out of my way to return.
The owner is really cool and friendly, but there is much better soul food to be found in NYC. Also, not a very sanitary place. It was just lovely when the server grabbed the part of our utensils that go in the mouth with his bare hands to lay them on the table. Then grabbed our drinks by the rims and took them in the back to refill them instead of using a pitcher. Otherwise, decent food, cool vibe, cheap prices.
3.5. Everything is good here. I had the bulgogi hotstone thing with pork dumplings deep fried, salad and soup. Buddy had their seafood lunch salad with same extras. Both liked it but have to say its food for the meek.
This fried chicken spot is closer to my place than pies n thighs but the chicken meat is drier and they fry it longer which makes it more dark brown. The waffles like most waffles in NYC are dense which I'm not a fan of. But they come in different flavors. There are a variety of drinks here more than pies n thighs. Better music and vibe but service is spotty. Long waits for brunch on weekends.
Noodle Village is a great place if you're looking for traditional Hong Kong style noodle soups. While this place can get pretty crowded on the weekends during lunch, their high quality Hong Kong style food make it worth it. It also doesn't hurt that the prices are extremely affordable in addition to having large portion sizes.  For their sides, I loved their steam rice roll (similar to dim sum rice crepes, but with sauce and no meat on the inside). For their entrees, I recommend their braised beef brisket tendon over rice and shrimp wonton noodle soup. Another dish that I would recommend is their beef and tomato ramen soup, however, I only recommend this dish for those who really enjoy tomato based dishes such as Chinese tomatoes & eggs over rice.
We called for reservations at 5pm to which we were told it was too soon to reserve for 6pm so we made it for 7pm. we got there at 7:05pm and they said the table wasn't ready. the restaurant was half empty. we waited for about  5 minutes to be seated (i have a 2.5 year old), i asked for a booth that was empty and the hostess said it was reserved :(. that should have been our sign to get the hell out. because it wasn't  the waiter was not attentive, served people that were there after before us, forgot our order, we got our drinks 20 minutes after we order. he was having fun at the bar with some other patrons. the food was not that great but i will give them that.  the service here is horrendous to say the least. the only person that actually was on point was the bus boy which we asked for a spoon and ketchup and he brought right away (we asked our waiter but he forgot). management needs to invest in some customer service classes for their waiters and hostess.  PS. AC wasn't working either it was 85 degrees in there.
Great experience at the bar! Waited for our table for awhile, which was still fine! Got to our table and got passed by 3 times, with no menus. Got bread before even seeing a server. Server Jocie finally makes it to our table, and asked what we wanted. Asked her for menus and seemed like it was a burden that she had to go out of her way to grab some. Comes back and asked for our order..... after that, didn't see her until she gave me my check. But she sure was checking on ALL of her other tables, but my group and I were completely neglected. Food and drinks were all absolutely amazing, but our service was completely awful.
I had the lobster roll and clam chowder (combo) it came with a drink and chips! Delicious but pricey, definitely worth it. Check it out!
There are some decent food options here, but why bother when better food is available close by, at better prices and with much better seating and a chance to make reservations? Is it really so hard for people to agree on a place to go that you need to put up with discomfort so one can get ramen and others tacos? At 6 on a Saturday evening, it was very difficult to find 4 seats--we wound up cleaning off a dirty table as best we could, sitting on benches with no backs which were not only very uncomfortable but with no place to put a jacket, with no space between it and the next bench table. Chosa is good for Mexican, but the sushi place is mediocre.  There are ten places on 9th Avenue between 45 and 46th (Obao, the various Thai places, the Chinese noodle place), which are better, cheaper and easier to dine in.
I got there before the rest of the party in the reservation arrived and they seated me. Great start! I was looking forward to some great seafood.  It was a night when the lobster dinner was on special. Soon the place filled up with people who put on plastic bibs to eat lobster and they all seemed happy. I ordered a crab cake and was looking forward to eating some kind of pan lightly fried seasoned crab patty. I got a flabby dark patty on a roll and I wondered if it had been deep fried. The fries were less than crispy. So very disappointing. The service was good.
It's quantity over quality. But you will get a lot for $. In fact this is true for the entire city island seafood scene.
Everything we had was phenomenal. From the small plates, the vegetables the Little Gems, the pastas which were absolutely great. Best of all was the octopus. If they have it you have to get it. The only downside was the service which was a little nagging and too much in our face. But aside from that and enjoyable evening
We've  been in this place couple times and everything was great. But unfortunately we've  got disappointed.  The sea food is super good. I've got nothing to say,except that oysters are always super fresh and tasty.   Last time when we went to this place, we had the best duck ever,it was super smooth,with nice tender skin and meat was literally melting in the mouth.Unfortunately this time when we came back for this duck our experience turned off to a different story. The duck came up cold. We told about that to our server,in a minute manager took it from us and apologized. After couple minutes it came wormed up. But It wasn't that melty as last time,just average duck. All garnish was crispy,with a lot of sauce to make it look better,instead to be as nice warm greens,I guess if they kept it for 1 more minute it would turn to the ash.  Usually in a other restaurants to make everything go smoother if there is an issue on a table they are giving discount or at lest complimentary dessert or drink. But unfortunately they don't have this policy I guess.   Service average. Mine opinion that they need to be a little bit more attentive especially on last tables,when it's not that busy.  If it would be my first time here,I wouldn't give even 2 stars.
Cute little meatball shop in a happening area in the LES. It's only natural that I stumbled in here drunk at some crazy hour of the next morning. So my inhibitions were definitely gone.  Naturally I ordered the naked balls (no pun intended yet in the night) with the spicy meat sauce and a meatball smash (again no pun intended yet in the night). Let's say meatballs are meatballs and these were pretty good from what I can remember ... but it's just one of those things were I realized that the price of a drunken eat in the LES was a bit much. Anyways, there probably wasn't much choice at the hour (still a NYC noob)), but I enjoyed it and it was solid. Just don't know if it's a place to revisit with everything else around it. Cheers!
Damnit son!  This place is so good. We us mini octopus.  They were crispy and tangy and fuckin bangin.  Then some noodles.  Then ribs.  Itis
"My girlfriend introduced me to this place.  The atmosphere of the place is very nice. We went there for brunch.  Think ""wood-sy."" and bungalow.  Deviled Eggs: There were about 5 of them.  They were good. About par. Smoked Salmon Crostini: I liked this dish. Most places, the smoked flavor overtakes the taste buds, this had a hint of it. I enjoyed this one a lot. Buttermilk Biscuits: I enjoyed this with the butter and jam and my coffee. The coffee there was strong and I enjoyed it with these biscuits. Another point for the biscuits. soup of the day: tomato gazpacho? I can't remember the exact name. It was a chilled soup.  It was different at first, but then you keep on eating it and it grows on you.  It had a punch to it, like the dressing on a cold cut sandwich?!?! I liked it. Overall Impression: The atmosphere was nice. It was a beautiful place. The food was probably some of the best I've had in NYC so far.  Every dish was good, which is difficult. It was a chilly morning and the AC was blasting. We happened to sit under the draft (they said they lowered the AC, but it kept on running).  Other than this minor hiccup, the place is nice. I'd probably go back, sometime in the evening next time to check out the lighting."
This place has my favorite soup dumplings. I have yet to find another place that rivals Joe's. Other food is delicious too.
"I used to go here a lot. The service was always great. However, I took some time off because the menu hadn't changed in a while and the food quality was going down (read: they kept serving me raw steak). After a long hiatus, I decided to eat Dig Inn. I ordered a steak and avocado salad. The cashier told me that it'll be a 5 minute wait. ""Fine,"" I said. I'll be right back. I went to the men's room then quickly returned, standing right by the same cashier for a few minutes, waiting. I then turned around to ask: ""Excuse me, is the salad still being made?"". She asked "", did you order it?"" I said "", yes."" She then said that it was being made and pointed behind her. A few more minutes passed and then she asked me if I had paid. I said that I hadn't (I figured she'd know this since she literally just saw me 5 minutes ago and the line at 2PM is pretty nonexistent). She then said that I hadn't ordered it then. I'd already waited about 8 minutes at this point. I told her that I had in fact ordered it, which is why I was waiting there. She told me that I hadn't. At this point I was already pretty annoyed because she had given me a pretty big attitude throughout. So I asked her if she was kidding. Her cashier friends called the manager over. I tried to explain the situation to the manager, but the cashier interrupted again claiming that she was right. At this point I decided to walk away. This isn't worth fighting over, it's my lunchtime and I just wanted a quick bite to eat. I'll go to one of the many other shops in Hudson Eats. I've spent over 500$ this year on Dig Inn. I'm sure they won't miss me as a customer since I'm only one customer. Maybe it was the time of day. Maybe they were just tired of being upbeat. Or maybe the new manager doesn't explain the importance of customer service to the new staff. Or maybe they realize that they have such a high traffic location that customer service really isn't important. I don't really know. All I know is that the experience I had was bad enough to want to write about it."
The Greek Kitchen offers spectacularly poor service, characterized by rude and inattentive staff. Would not visit again.
Without a doubt my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn. Every time I go I try something new and I'm always impressed. The service is great and the restaurant has character, lovely ambiance.  They only accept cash but that's never been an inconvenience considering they have their own ATM in the restaurant (by the restrooms).  Side note: It's also a short walk from the Fulton Ferry Landing Pier. Take a lovely walk through the cobblestone streets to the pier where you'll find a gorgeous  Manhattan skyline view. It's one of my favorite spots to visit when I come the city :)I
FISH TACOS!! So yummy, it is hard for me to live so far away from the Breakroom.  It's always a dilemma for me when I go to Chinatown. Soup dumplings or tacos/burgers? It was a tough call but so glad I chose breakroom - the burgers and tacos are delicious!  *Taco Platter: you get to pick three of your fav tacos for $10.95, theyre $3.95 each otherwise. Dinosaur and I got the tempura fish, pork belly and steak taco and enjoyed all. Fish taco was our fav. Comes with a hefty slice of avo and the fish was battered and fried to crisp perfection. Can't get better than this. The pork belly wasn't the best, but was still ok. Good bang for the buck because these three babies are filling.  *Breakroom burger: comes with fried egg, yay! It is a bit difficult to each because it is STUFFED with toppings. I like the jalepeno peppers that add the extra spice. The patty is cooked really well and the burger is very juicy. I love the toasted brioche bun. UGH it's just good - get it, you wont regret it.  *Tatertots: I know, who gets these at restaurants? BUT THESE WERE SO GOOD. Crispy and just adds that extra umph to the tacos and burgers.  Limited seating, communal high top tables. You'll be elbow to elbow with your fellow breakroom diners.
A friend who's been loyal to this restaurant took us here, and we are very satisfied. Super busy. Food is excellent. Cheese pasta is their big thing. They bring out big cheese bowl to prep the pasta. Will recommend.
I wanted to love this place but was let down by the substandard Italian meals. Firstly the restaurant is very cool set in an old warehouse building. Furniture and decor is on point and appeals to the eye. Do make your way down stairs to the toilet as there is more pleasing fit out. Service is friendly and efficient. The menu contains the usual Italian fare with something to suit everyone, unfortunately my preferred pork option was not available so i opted for Risotto. We also ordered a large antipasto platter which was decent. Sadly my risotto was woeful. It was gluggy and almost like an asian congee. The was hardly and meat or vegetable in it. We also ordered meatballs which was also lacking. Its a shame as there is real potential here they just need to replace their cheffing team.
Came here on a Saturday and it was relatively busy. It was 530 and they were kind enough to give us a table at the bar for an hour without a reservation. The place is small but well laid out in terms of size. They have good food options which sound great on the menu. Sadly the waffles didn't really win with me - they were cheddar with bourbon maple syrup and definitely needed salt and a bit more cheesiness but I loved the whole wheat in them. We also had the deviled eggs which were super pretty and tasted really good as well. Didn't have the drinks but will next time.
A++ this place is one of THE BEST in town. A friend took me out here and I was blown away by the flavors and texture of the food here. Though the drinks are a bit on the pricey side ($12 for concoctions) it's still okay given that the food is absolutely worth it. Waiting for my friends from the south to come and visit so I can take them here and let 'em know how we do it up here in New York!!
Beautiful bar. Met a friend there midday while it was empty. Staff was pretty sweet.  AMAZING HAMBURGER!!!! (I stopped in for lunch... and multiple bloody Mary's)
Hate to say it, but I did not like this place at all... Initially went to Rubirosa but with a long long wait time we decided to give Soba-ya a chance. Soba-ya is located in Japan town and is a tiny restaurant that can fit around 50 ppl. Luckily we didn't have a wait when a party of 2 went at 730 and service was fine but we must had high hopes for the uni soba, or soba in general for what its worth. We ordered an appetizer of mixed veggies/shrimp tempera plate which came with 2 gigantic shrimps and about 5 veggies consisted of broccoli, carrot, sesame leaf, eggplant, and shishito pepper.  While bigger than norm, the shrimp didn't have much flavor and temperas overall was overly greasy. Next came our anticipated soba.  I predicted that I wouldn't like the yam paste and I was right but had already coaxed the soba with it.  At first it was edible but after couple bites, the slimy texture was way too overbearing for us to eat.  Not sure what a good soba tastes like but soba itself was nothing special at all either and I would rather eat the prepackaged one where you just boil the noodles.  Only reason that I didn't give a 1 star was the uni quality itself and that's the only thing we fished out from our bowls.   I'm not sure how this place got such good ratings or many reviews but I can make better soba at home.  In the end, I washed down the bad taste with a coke.  I spent $100 on a meal that I hated and started off on a bad note on our first night in NY.
A solid brunch location. Parking isn't too tricky with all the meters in the area. Check out their special menu for some unique dishes. I had a bloody mary and chicken & waffles. If I did not drive, I would definitely have a mimosa overdose.  Service was friendly, will be back. P.S: They got an old-school bathroom with the box and chain thing, just in case you need to tape a gun behind it to kill Solozzo to avenge your mafia father and hide from persecution in Italy for a few years.
Came here at 7pm on a Wednesday evening after work to grab a drink with co workers. There was enough space for people to walk around and also not too loud that it's difficult to talk.  The atmosphere is very clean and hipster. Great decorations and also dim for a good chat. I ordered a wine and the bar tender was every careful about cleaning the glass before pouring wine into it. See pics I posted.  Would come back for social events!
I was seriously disappointed with the size of the rolls. We got one lobster roll and and the Maine combo. Spent 39.00 for snacks. It was literally appetizers. Glad we weren't starving. I expected a lot more for the price. Had I known the size of the items I wouldn't have wasted my money. The lobster was good it was just lobster and butter on a roll. The shrimp was canned shrimp it wasn't prawns or tiger shrimp. The crab was big pieces. I should have checked yelp first however I just got a new phone and my yelp wasn't on my iPhone yet. Don't come hungry.
"Worst service I've encountered for a while. Sitting there for about 10 minutes, NO ONE came to greet or pour us water. Literally caught a waitress and only to hear: ""Oh sorry, I'm not responsible for this area."" Ridiculous. Not to mention people lined up for open tables, and the guy at the front desk was flirting with another waitress. Couldn't you see the line? (and there were tables available)  I'm still expecting the food at this point, but I lost my appetite already. Sorry. My first and last visit to this place. Manhattan has whole bunch of choices, you're not irreplaceable.  And for your reference, we came around 2pm on Saturday, it was about 45 minutes wait."
"I've been here once for brunch and another time for lunch. I usually go to their East Village location, but since I work pretty close to here, I'm bound to come here sometime for the delicious food. First off, this place is bigger than you'd expect. The dining area seems endless when you really get up and walk around (like me while trying to find the restroom). Brunch time here is no joke. They're always busy on the weekends, yet the staff is still attentive and accommodating. During lunch on the weekdays (around 2-3pm) it's pretty quiet. Second, the food is quite memorable. This is ""comfort food"" in my eyes. My favorite brunch item is the Sicilian Baked Eggs. Gooey cheese and eggs in a skillet with tomato sauce that has a bit of a kick- instant favorite. The breakfast pot pie is also generous and filling. Another favorite of mine is the bleu cheese potato chips- if you're a bleu cheese fan, GET THIS. It's insanely good. One thing I can live without, however, is the drink menu. A bit pricey for cocktails, but that's just the norm with the area the establishment is in. Keep in mind though- they do serve specialty cocktails during brunch time that are only available then."
Another example of Yelp not letting me down. We were headed to a different Italian restaurant but I wasn't feeling it because of the Yelp reviews. I convinced the group to switch to this restaurant and we were all glad we did. The calamari was not rubbery. The texture of the fettuccine seemed homemade -- lovely ribbons of pasta. The grilled shrimp was tasty. The penne vodka had great flavor. The chicken was moist and tender. The service was attentive. They made people celebrating birthdays feel special. All in all, a great find!
3.5 for Woodrow! Cool spot to grab lunch and include add alcohol to increase the pleasure. Very modest pub that serves fresh food and favorable customer service.  I didn't go to 4 or 5 stars because there was nothing extraordinary but I will definitely be back. me lioke!
As a drinking game, you and your friends should take shots every time someone leaves the patio door open when traveling between inside and outside. One hour and you'll all be totally WASTED. The food's good though.
The chicken here is okay. I've visited this place twice and the chicken seems to be over cooked; it's a dry chicken what you eat.  Also, they cook the fried plantain in the same oil as the french fries. I found French fries in my plantain and the taste was disgusting. Server didn't do anything about it.
The place is nice and the service was good. Went for lunch with family and none of us were impressed with the taste of the food except for the pizza.
Excellent pizza bear the brooklyn bridge! You can either wait for Grimaldi's or wait for Juliana's. The Juliana's line is shorter (although barely) and the pizza is very good. Plus they take credit cards. You can either eat at the restaurant or take your pizza to go and eat at brooklyn bridge park. If you take out, make sure you tell the person you want to order to go in order to skip the line. If you want to try classic New York style pizza, you can't go wrong with Juliana's.
We celebrated my birthday by having dinner in this Italian restaurant and it was soooooo good that the day after we went back to have lunch!
Ordered the Pad Kee Mao. Service was prompt and good was delicious! Sweet ambience too :)
First off, the restaurant is adorable, inside and out. The wait was not too bad. Brunch was good. I had the eggs Benedict that came with a side salad, an iced coffee, and a side of bacon. There wasn't anything that stood out for me. It felt just like any other place that offered brunch. The waiter was slow, but maybe it was because he was swamped with Sunday's crowd.
Been going to so many good seafood restaurants lately that my standards have elevated. Fish is indeed A-Ok, but ranks solidly in the middle. The place is too narrow and crowded to be comfortable, and the dim lighting for some reason doesn't create ambiance or romantic atmosphere. It just creates...dimness. We started with the raw sampler, which had 6 west coast oysters, 2 clams, and 3 shrimp. Apparently this is not meant to be shared, because you're given only one of each type of mollusk, plus an odd number of shrimp. But weirdly, the serving size of this sampler seems awkward for only one person to eat. So yeah...but at least I liked what I had. The other dish we shared was the clams casino, which had nice flavors of ham, but otherwise it was just kind of salty. I had a pot of steamed mussels which was pretty good. I did feel like the garlic butter that was steamed in there was more garlic than butter. All in all, everything was fine, but nothing really stood out for me.
Bad hummus! The bread is the best thing about their falafel platter, especially when its warm. Falafel balls are a bit bland, but the hummus was runny and bland, a disappointment.
They had me at Tipsy Tea (it is basically 2 cocktails served from a teapot into a teacup with ice ball). Along with my personal pot of cocktails the brunch special included a brunch entree and tea cookies for dessert. Sold! I like the bourbon tea the best. The Brussels' sprout hash was lacking seasoning like salt but the fries I ordered made up for that. The service was good and were patient with us since we had a party member running late but they sat us and let us order drinks anyway.
Where do I begin the service was horrible. After waiting over an hour when we were quoted a 30 minute wait the service was slow. We were in a hurry to place our order since we waited so long and it was wrong. Half of our food came out before the appetizers and it was not even what we ordered finally the appetizers came out and it was still missing food. As a family member with a person with numerous food allergies I make sure to specify what items cannot be on a plate. After telling the waitress the food items caused severe allergic reactions to the point of hospitalization they took back the plate just re-cooked the food then served it with no dressing or sides but you can see the residue of the old sauce. Honestly I hope this place gets it together the other blends are great this one really let me down I'm not sure if I will come back here again.
I was craving good BBQ and decided to try this place since it's close by. I ordered the half rack or ribs and macaroni and cheese. I'm sorry to say but it wasn't cheap (they wouldn't let me substitute fries for Mac and cheese so I had to ordered the starter, and was lacking flavor. It was all bland,and the BBQ sauce wasn't thick. I hate to give a bad review but I just spent $30 to be disappointed.
"After walking a ton in NYC, you have to find a place where the menu and the atmosphere appeals to you.    This place hit both of those for me.  We ordered Bloody Marys which were good but I wish they had a little more ""alcohol"" in them.   I got the shashuka (not sure how to spell it) but basically tomato sauce with eggs baked in it.  It was very good and it was served with some pita bread.  I would have liked more heartier bread with it.   I forget what my husband ordered.   Very cute place, clean and they were super efficient.   My cell phone was next to dead and they let us charge it behind the bar while we ate.   Very nice of them.   I would recommend this place if you are in the area."
Had been wanting to come here for a while and so glad we came! Food was excellent, the bartender was friendly, really cool and he made my drink Mr. Horchata really delicious. It's a young, hip scene with loud hip hop playing in the background. Definitely will return!
not bad but not great. not exactly the review an establishment should be aiming for. food was honestly decent, but at the price point and service they are providing, this place was a no-go for me.  what went wrong: first they seated my part of 5 all the way in the back with the worst seating. every time someone would enter or leave the kitchen, the clothe curtain would brush against my friend's hair. we requested for a different seat immediately and although complied, were given a snooty attitude. sorry but no one wants to eat like that. the second thing: when we finished our oysters (which were actually pretty fresh!) and the waiter took our platters away, liquid from the dish spilled into my friend's wine. we all looked at each other and then looked at the waiter and he didn't say a thing until my friend asked for a replacement glass of wine. was he not going to say anything if we had not noticed?  overall, food was ok- bit pricey for what it is but i wouldn't come back simply because of the service
We came in for brunch after reading all of the wonderful reviews.  The place has a rustic look that's very charming, the service was good and we were excited to try the food here.  We ordered the salmon crostini and the Italian  chicken and waffles. After eating a few bites of my salmon crostini and fries I started to wonder when the wonderful flavor would kick in.  What was really perplexing was the fact that the food looked so amazing however the taste was far from it. The   salmon and egg were very salty and the fries were just meh. I left most of the food on my plate.  I had a few bites of the chicken and waffles and the chicken was practically flavorless, it was as though they forgot to add any seasoning. The waffle was good. Perhaps the chef was just having an off day with the seasoning, the taste of the food left much to be desired.
For $6-7/bowl of noodle it is one of the budget-whole-in-the-wall places in Manhattan. The noodles are hand pulled- your meal may be interrupted by the sounds of the man stretching, slapping and pulling the dough. The noodles are excellent and just the right texture (a slight chewiness. The meat was okay, I wasn't a huge fan of the tendon (hence the 4 stars), so I think the brisket is a better deal. They give you plenty of dough-packed noodles; I was filled halfway through the meal.  But the DUMPLINGS. I would definitely recommend! For 8/$3 it is such a steal. You can get them steamed or fried (I prefer the slight crunch in the fried). I remember drooling while watching the women hand making them. They are juicy and probably some of the best dumplings I've ever had. When I come back I'm probably just going to order two orders of these.  It's a really good deal in Chinatown especially on colder days.
"I'm so happy that this place is within walking distance from my apartment. My boyfriend and I have been coming here at least once a month and it's always something we look forward to because the food and service are a real treat. The staff is so welcoming and they always do their best to accommodate their customers. Each staff member will regularly check up on you to make sure you have what you need or just to say ""Hi, how have you been?"" I've looked around and I see they treat everyone with the same friendly service. So far, every food we have tried was ridiculously delicious. We CRAVE them after every visit. I think our goal will be to try everything on the menu at one point. Our favorites are the Spicy Buffalo Wings, Hot Dog, Alcove Fries, Patacones, Skirt Steak Lollipops, and of course the Alcove Burger. My favorite drink is the Coconut Mojito. The prices aren't too over the top, but the quality of the items on the menu is definitely worth it. The portions are pretty generous and good to share! Actually, the other night when we were ordering our food, we mentioned we'd be sharing it and when the food came out, they had graciously split our food in half for us! They did not even have to do that at all, but we are so grateful they took the time to do that for us. Jonathan, Spencer, and Dylan usually take quick moments to chat with us during the course of our meal and they are the ones that make this place worth coming back to. The Alcove is an embodiment of delicious food and drinks, awesome staff, and memorable dining experiences."
I was excited to eat here while I was visiting in NYC, their impressive Yelp stats will draw tourist and locals in for a delicious meal. There is a lot of hype about their XLB (soup dumplings), and they really are amazing!  I've been to many dumpling places in Southern California, and as far as XLB, Joe's are at the top of the list. This place may be busy, or have a wait, but it's definitely worth the wait! Another thing that makes this place worth the wait is that their service is much better compared to other Chinese places in NYC. I believe they maintain being traditional, but are more used to serving tourist. Any place with thousands of reviews on Yelp have to maintain awesome service, and theirs was awesome. We ordered the pork soup dumplings, house fried rice, scallion pancakes, and the crispy duck. The scallion pancakes were so good, and super cheap. The fried rice was awesome. I would say the fried rice, scallion pancakes, and XLB are all must order items. The duck was very good as well. This place definitely earns their reputation for the top Chinese place in Chinatown. A must for any tourist looking for a great dining experience.
5 stars for the ambiance and service! This place is super hip! Great modern decor! Phenomenal service. Staff members were quick and friendly! Ramen - smaller bowl than usual and doesn't have a lot of toppings but the broth was so delicious and the portion was just right. Also, great sake menu.
I have been here on two visits and I have to say it went from good to really good. I came on my second trip with Luci B since she has a rather healthy obsession with Cajun/Creole food and we were both pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food we received. This place was good for us since we are both big fans of food from Louisiana. When we arrived around 7ish on the weekday, it had a decent number of tables occupied, when 7:30pm hit, it got packed! The place has a very cool vibe and the decor is awesome, so get there early. The food: Gumbo- Chicken and Andouille sausage in a dark roux. Served with rice. This was awesome! It was my hands down favorite dish of the night, there was so much complex flavors. You can really tell they put time and effort to develop the flavor of the roux with the rice and the Andouille and all the flavors worked out perfectly. There was also a slight kick of heat, which was a nice welcome addition.   Jambalaya Mac and Cheese- Mixed with spicy Creole tomato gravy and Andouille sausage. I really enjoyed the flavor of this, I loved the spicy aspect because it cut some of the richness and heaviness you normally get from mac and cheese. The flavors really worked and this dish was well thought out to balance the flavor, my only criticism would be the macaroni was too soft, I wish the macaroni was less cooked. But overall, I would get this again.  Spicy Dark Meat Fried Chicken with Biscuit- I thought the fried chicken was made well, it was not greasy, it was juicy and it had good flavor. I did find the chicken to be a tad one note and I wish it was a tad more crunchy but still good. The salad was very well dressed, the dressing was properly coated and it was light and refreshing and it was a nice palate cleanser after the fried chicken. The biscuit was nice but it was kinda dense.  Crawfish Etouffee- A spicy Cajun stew with Louisiana crawfish. Served with rice. This had a good pronounced crawfish flavor in the broth, I thought this was a flavorful dish but paled in comparison to the Jambalaya dish. This is worth trying.  Fried Popcorn Okra- I love Okra and I enjoyed the flavor of these but I thought the Okra was a tad too soft, I like my fried Okra to me a little more firm, I also thought the Okra ran a tad salty. I was hoping to really love the version here but it was just OK. 
Its true when they say ippudo is the best ramen in nyc! The shiromatu hakata classic was so good. You can add on more toppings of your choice if you'd like to. My friend got the akamaru modern and it was very good as well. The interior decor is so fun and cool too. Def will be returning and def worth the 40 min wait.
Nothing tops fresh made pasta at an Italian restaurant. Scarpetta definitely met my needs of al dente pasta, blasting with flavor. When we arrived, we were seated right away. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the service was super nice and attentive. As for the food, it was great quality and execution of the meals. We started with the complimentary bread, which were three types of bread, accompanied by three different things to spread/tip the bread in: olive oil, an eggplant tomato sauce and mascarpone butter. Everything was delicious. The bread was fresh and the dips/spreads just made everything more delicious. We then moved to the appetizer of the creamy polenta which came highly recommended from a friend. She was right. It was great. The polenta was cooked perfectly, super creamy. The mix of the mushroom sauce just elevated the dish to another level. I could have eaten a full bowl of that polenta. Although polenta is typically heavy, it felt light and delicate from the mushroom sauce. As for the entrees, we ordered a side of wild mushrooms and two pasta dishes, the spaghetti and duck and foie gras ravioli. The wild mushrooms was a great side. You can easily split between 3-4 people. The mushrooms were cooked nicely, slightly chewy and had an acidity to it, maybe balsamic olive oil.  The pastas were delicious. Scarpetta is really well known for their spaghetti. Although one might just think, spaghetti, what is so special, it really is special because of its simplicity elevated to an eloquent level. The pasta itself was al dente but what made it shine was the tomato and basil sauce. It just had the right balance of everything. It was creamy yet not overly creamy. The flavors all just popped. It was also a good big portion. As for the foie gras and duck ravioli, that was cooked perfectly as well. The ravioli pasta was just as al dente and the filling was full of flavor. It was not overwhelmed by any one flavor profile but instead mixed perfectly well with each other, into a creamy filling. We ended the meal with the espresso bundido which was also executed beautifully. The hazelnut ice cream and espresso mousse was smooth, countered by these chocolate cookie crisps of some sort. Very yummy and big enough to split between two people easy.  One thing I feel the need to add though is the extra charge of a scoop of ice cream for my boyfriend's birthday they gave. I had mentioned while getting seated that it was his birthday due to a situation that was happening, not really expecting anything from the restaurant. I thought maybe they would add a candle to the dessert since we ordered something but it didn't come with it, which was fine because I didn't specify for it. What did come though was a nice plate that said happy birthday with a scoop of what seemed to be coconut gelato. It was delicious! And I appreciated the thought and that they remembered it was his birthday. I think what caught me off guard was they charged me $4 for the ice cream thatI didn't really ask for. $4 is nothing to cry over and I didn't feel the need to challenge the charge but in case anyone is taking someone for their birthday here, fair warning you could be charged for something you didn't necessarily ask for.
"I was given an estimate of an hour and a half wait. Fine, left and came back before the estimated time and waited some more. I came up and asked them a couple of times how long it'd take, they kept saying ""a couple more minutes,"" finally after about 2 hours and 15 minutes, we came and asked them how much longer, they said they had ""called us"" and we weren't there. Mhm, we were standing in the waiting area for a whole hour, I'm pretty sure they saw us. I felt like when they call the names for the table they sorta just half-assed it. ""Andrew? No andrew? Ok."" I was already pissed before I was seated because of the initial service. There's no point to give people an estimated time and not be able to honor it, and if they can't, just be transparent about it and let me know. Don't have to keep extending and extending the time and then say ""we called you already."" On to the food. When we were first seated, some random dude just came and literally THREW the bread at us. Whatever, I'm already mad. Can't get any worse. Why was their bread so cold btw? We ordered the calamari, penne a la vodka, and the meatballs. Yes, the portions were huge, yes, you will not be able to finish it. So it's safe to share these dishes. They're family style! Calamari was the best part of the dinner. Their penne a la vodka was aight, the noodles were a little hard, the sauce was ok. Their meatballs... well.. Tastes like meatballs. There is literally nothing special about Camine's except for the fact that they serve food that could feed an entire horse. Maybe two.  The restaurant was quite nice, kinda fancy, I can't believe the shitty service. Oh, our server was very nice and very good though. At least they're doing something right."
I stopped in for a burger a few weekends ago, during that weird lull after brunch and before dinner (late lunch/early dinner?). I was sat way in the front which felt odd but I didn't protest. My server was friendly but forgot a few of my items, and I had to flag him down many times. The burger was decent but didn't come with cheese like I had ordered. The place feels like a mix between a sports bar and a nice sit down place, so maybe too many things are happening at once. Stop by if you're in the area and want a bite, just be prepared to leave feeling like you deserved a bit more.
Great service, the owner was also very friendly and genuine.  French onion soup and grilled chicken sandwich were both amazing.  Great place to stop if your are close to the 9/11 memorial or Battery Park.
I'm sick and hungry. Ordered an hour ago and food is still not here. While their food is okay and comforting for WaHi standards, all my delivery orders to date have never arrived less than 45 mins. And it's crazy to think they're literally two blocks away from me. If I wasn't sick I would've walked but poor me :(
FIRE THE MANAGER! If you're the owner of this restaurant I implore you to fire the manager on duty Friday night. The service was horrible and that starts from the top. I watched him sit at the bar with his buddies even though a group of very drunk girls were literally falling down right in front of him (this was around 8 pm). He laughed. After sufficient time sitting at the bar with that friend he moved to another friend at the other end of the bar and proceeded to eat and hang out with this friend while there was only one server working her ass off to service the bar tables. Not to be outdone he moved back to the other friend and just sat at the bar with him balance of the night. There were single people who walked in looking for a spot at the bar and left because there were no seats...... HE WAS IN ONE MOST OF THE NIGHT!! Not once did he recognice other patrons in the bar. Not once did he look at drinks coming up and help out. Not once did he realize that people were waiting for drinks and food and help out. I feel horrible for my amazing server who did all she could to support the bar lounge.  This guy makes other Restaurant Managers look bad. I will never come back here Signed  GUY WHO LIVES RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER AND LOVES OYSTERS!!!!
My girlfriend and I were seated in the back garden w the waterfall. My girlfriend has a severe gluten allergy (celiac) and our waiter, Simon, was extremely knowledgeable. We ordered the assorted mixed spreads and salads platter and it was absolutely amazing. Gluten free dairy free and soy free. The drinks were amazing, too! Highly recommended.
Had Fried Chicken and Waffle for brunch it was delicious!  I will definitely come back for dinner.
The Akamaru Modern is my favorite ramen here, and definitely what you should get if it's your first time. Its pork broth is extremely rich and the noodles are firm and not bloated with water, kind of like al dente at an Italian place. People who like spicy stuff should consider Karaka-Men, which comes with a nice dollop of chili sauce. Always add a poached egg. I'm not too crazy about their buns. Get the pork one if you want to try it. The chicken is not great -- they use what seems like pieces of orange chicken and, inexplicably, lots of mayo. At peak meal times, expect to wait 1-2 hours before you're seated. In case you get hungry, just go around the corner to the hotel on 51st and 8th Ave -- they have a bowl of free apples in the lobby.
The ramen is at best average. Broth is slightly dull and noodles are glassy. Service is quick and place is neat.
Ultra fresh & all the sources/purveyors are listed on the boards.  Limited menu. Cape Cod chips & Dr. brown's soda round out the experience. Not the biggest rolls we've had BUT the quality is excellent & proportion is fair for the average price around $14. We had the Jacob's crab claw appetizer, two crab rolls & 1 lobster roll. Beautifully buttery grilled split top rolls compliment the tender fresh seafood slathered in clarified butter & a sprinkling of celery salt. Outdoor seating almost under the Manhattan Bridge along the Hudson.  A great stop for lunch if you dig seafood & dining outdoors.
First visit there. I have to say i never tried this kind of food, and i was pleasantly surprised. The service was awsome and very helpfull. I took the mashroom chicken biscuit as recommended by the waitress, and it was crunchy, creamy and interesting. The grit that came with the dish was delicious. If you're looking for American comfort food, this is definitely the place you need.
Definitely over-priced and touristy, but so fun to explore! It offers quite a few places to eat, both sit down and grab-n-go. But for the most part it's a gourmet grocery. You can find fresh pasta, bread, all sorts of cheeses, chocolates, meats and produce. Be warned, it's usually crowded!
My boyfriend and I came on a Sunday night for his birthday celebration. It was a last minute decision to go to Juliana's - we were thinking of heading to Dekalb Market for a light dinner, but we decided we wanted pizza instead. Therefore, we head over to Old Fulton to see a light line forming outside (FYI it seems to be that there's always a line). We asked the hostess (situated inside while the line forms outside) how long she thinks the wait will be. She informed us it was around 35-45 minutes. At 5:40pm, it was still a wait for a pre-dinner slot, but we decided to stay and try it.  Although we did wait the full 45 minutes, it really didn't feel like too long. Mostly because the weather was nice, but maybe it had to do with the fact that 20 minutes in our wait, they came out with a big pie of pizza and offered it to those on the line. We had a taste of what to anticipate - and we were thrilled. Apparently, when their pizza does not come out perfectly, they hand it out to those who are waiting in line instead of throwing it away. Not sure how often the complimentary pizza happens, but it was a nice gesture of them and we were pleased because we were among the last few people who had a slice. We were seated after around 40-45 minutes wait. I have to say I really do like their system because keeping the crowd outside made the dining experience much better. It was quiet and peaceful in the restaurant and we were promptly served. We asked for two drinks, the meatballs for appetizer and for entree one large pizza with pepperoni. The food came out promptly, the service was great, and the price was $45 for all of that - which I thought was very fair for quality pizza. The pizza was amazing!! It definitely is on the top of my pizza list. The pie really reminds me of the pizza I had in Naples, Italy (although the ones in Naples tend to get a bit soggy - Juliana's pizza's crust was soft and thin, but not soggy.) It was a very authentic Italian pie and everything about it was delicious. We could not finish the whole pie and we were super stuffed. Overall, if you are a pizza buff, you definitely need to come here and try the pizza. I know it is a bit old fashioned for the line and the fact they don't have a better waiting system (text or number) I think it is because for them, it increases the hype. When people walk past and see a huge line, they get curious. FYI - Grimaldi's next door does the same thing. But trust me, Juliana's is worth the wait.
Good portion sizes. Very quick pick up. Food was pretty good. Had spicy pork, beef bulgogi, and purple rice bowl. Was pretty good. Pretty spicy and had pretty good flavor.
The food is just amazing, and the vibe is on point I can't recommend this place enough. Khao suey, the sizig and the pork noodles. The small plates are pretty large, so order with caution if you don't want to take home a box like us. But that's great too! More of the goodness! :) Don't think, just go!
Angel was our waitor, what a great guy he offered the Baci Mousse dessert best dessert we ever had!!! What a great evening, service everything!!!
I've been in search for some REAL Barbecue, so I've read all the reviews of many of the top Barbecue joints on the 5 boros and Butcher Bar happen to be the most convenient on a Wednesday night. We ordered The burnt end which were good. Smoked brisket was overcooked,dry not much smoke. Sausage was a pork Italian sausage, on the menu(grilled sausage). I was expecting more of a beef/pork sausage. The sides we ordered baked beans, corn on the cob and Mac and cheese were average at best. Also my granddaughter had a ribeye med/rare and came rare. I don't mind paying for good Barbecue because it's a craft and labor intensive. But if your going to charge top dollar, you better be putting out some good Barbecue.
While waiting at the bar for our table my friend said she saw a cockroach run across the ground. 5 minutes later I realized there was a cockroach running up my arm!!! I freaked out and the staff took no notice. When we were seated and waiting for our food to arrive I saw another cockroach run across the floor under our table. I couldn't relax for the rest of the night and did not want to eat anything. My friend and I wanted to leave but the rest of our party wanted to stay and were not bothered by the roaches as they had not come into direct contact with them. We told the bar tender and our server about the roaches and they comped us for 1 appetizer. I would never come here again. They are obviously infested with roaches. The staff seemed totally unphased by the roaches so I guess it's a regular occurrence for them. The worst thing is that Food Sanitation Dept gave it an A grade. My friend who works in the food industry said it's common to have roaches and still pass the health and safety inspection with an A grade. Definitely avoid!!! I also noticed that other people  who also saw cockroaches have posted reviews. This restaurant obviously has a big roach problem.
"To be honest, the only thing that attracted me to dine at this restaurant was their ""Holy Cannoli"" that has been shown on insider. I can honestly tell you, depending on what you like, that I only liked the birthday cake half of it rather than the strawberry half. The presentation was amazing and looked so cute. Just to get to the beginning of the meal, we ordered a bruschetta and it tasted quite good. Our entree was the pesto pasta, and it tasted really good! My date wanted to order another dish to take to work tomorrow. Lol. My date and I split everything and it came out to be $60. Our server was very nice and the environment was pretty cool."
New local business that just opened 5 days ago right across from our residence! Been waiting for this place to open for a while now, so glad it did.  The  ratings are for the customer service and interaction we received today from the owners and staff. Starting with the staff, very welcoming, friendly and attentive. The owners also came over to check on us and see how we were enjoying things. Being that I'm from LA, I told him my experience about the Boiling Crab and the Boil in NY, making some suggestions and recommendations to him about their menu items, sauce etc. I loved that he was super open to suggestions and recommendations and actually listening to what I had to say. Definitely helps knowing they value their customers opinions. Coming to the food...we had the fried calamari for appetizer which was great! Just recommend making it slightly bigger in portion and perhaps charging more to go accordingly. My husband and I then shared the Dungeness Crab and 1lb of Shrimp with the house special sauce. The sauce was interesting and definitely different from the boil or boiling crab...but we enjoyed it! I feel the shrimp portion was slight less compared to other places so highly recommend more shrimp for the price. As for the Dungeness Crab, I'd probably recommend the snow crab legs over it just due to preference. Overall, I definitely recommend trying this place out and supporting the business due to reasons listed above. I hope my recommendations are considered to give this place higher ratings the second time around!
It's been years since I last visited this place because I found out there is another branch of Nyonya in Brooklyn which was closer to me. I was craving for a Malaysian food (Nasi Lemak to be specific) and all I can think of is Nyonya. Honestly, I prefer this branch since the server are nicer and the food prep is pleasing to my eyes and palate. I also like how they presented the images of the dishes on their menu. Food porn! There is another malaysian place near my work but it is nothing compared to Nyonya's. Soon, my appetite for Malaysian food will surely be back again and I will have the Nasi Lemak of Nyonya as the benchmark. On my future visit(s), I will try out their noodle soup, looks delicious. Selamat Makan!
I took my mother here for our mom-daughter day. I made a reservation for 11:30am but due to the funky track work for MTA, we were running late. When I called to tell them they were very kind and said no problem, we'll see you when you get here. So, friendly folks, check. When we were arrived around 11:50am we were quickly seated and addressed by our waitress. Tables are close together so there's not too much room, but it was enough space to be comfortable. I imagine upstairs would have been better seating though because the bottom level was drafty due to the opening of the door.  We ordered the Steak and Eggs and Chicken and Waffles with coffee and fresh squeezed OJ. EVERYTHING was delicious and pleasing to the eye. The steak comes with cheddar polenta and a sunny side up egg. The waffles come with tender, well-seasoned chicken. The OJ tasted fresh squeezed and the coffee was strong. Wait staff was attentive but not overbearing. To finish it off we had brioche donuts which sound weird w the sour cinnamon sugar topping, but when you dip them in the smoked butterscotch?? It was really good. We rolled out of there two happy ladies.
The food was ok nothing on the menu was worth the price, honestly. The service was simply Horrible!  They don't have a waiter staff just some lady who walks around taking your order dressed like she never changed after the gym, raggedy white t, yoga pants, and running shoes. The server looked better prepared to hit the gym than for taking your order. I am still waiting on my soft drink I ordered ten (long) minutes before we received our bill.
This is one of my Bedstuy staples.  The fried chicken dinner is delicious and comes with a side and cornbread and yummy pickles.  The hot fried chicken is my favorite (it's always been spicy, flavorful, and juicy).  They switch up the side dishes based on season (I think) and I wish they'd bring back their baked beans and potato salad.  I think their mac & cheese is meh and I wish the cornbread servings were larger.  I highly recommend you go during off peak hours or do carry out because hardly any restaurant is worth a 1-2 hour + wait.
I am writing this review from my boyfriends phone because I could not wait for mine to regain battery before writing this establishment the review it deserves.  The food was incredibly small in proportion especially after the server meticulously weighted every single strand of pulled pork and brisket as if they were precious slabs of gold. The meat was delicious, but incredibly overpriced.  But this is really what took the cake from our experience: two of the employees were very obviously and uncomfortably and DISRESPECTFULLY staring at our table as we tried to eat and enjoy our menial pieces of meat. An employee then proceeded to very obviously take a picture of me (or at least in my direction) to which I caught him doing so. He then proceeded to follow me as I stepped outside for some fresh air (this place is a gas chamber).  I was incredibly uncomfortable and other female members at my table took notice of the uncomfortable staring. After sharing my discomfort with my boyfriend he went back inside to get to the bottom of the situation. The employee then showed him the picture and tried to cover up his actions by claiming he was taking a picture of something behind our table. Regardless of the intent it was uncomfortable, disrespectful, and inconsiderate as a female.  Don't waste your time or money or right to privacy on this place. You'll probably have a better time at the fried chicken place across the street.
Came here w my gf on a Thursday summer night for a low key birthday dinner. Honestly the best meal I've had all summer - food was delicious and service excellent. We shared the chicken buns, fried pork dumplings, dragon roll, truffle fries, bulgogi and chicken bowls - yup a lot of food but would definitely recommend every single item. Maybe not so much the two main dishes as the tapas style plates were perfect to share. Don't make the mistake of skipping dessert. Bread pudding and churros we're both excellent.
I have been few times in this place, the staff is very friendly and helpful, the atmosphere is very good, though the music playing was a bit loud and the sitting area bit uncountable. They also have table outside but I did not have a chance to try it because is winter. There are a lot of draft beers and they changed it very frequently. The food is very good I can recommend the Smoked Ribs a 1/2 rack house-smoked St. Louis ribs with Jerk Sauce or Bronx Alehouse BBQ sauce, very juicy and delicious, the wings and French fries are pretty good. Don't Order the burger is not good. But is nice to see a quality bar in the Bronx, I will come back more often.
I went here for dinner with a bunch of friends on Saturday night and the food was fantastic!  The only reason they aren't getting 5 stars is because I called several days before to make a reservation for 6 and when I called Saturday to say we may be a few minutes late they didn't have us down.  The hostess was very accommodating, though, and had a table for us fairly quickly. This place is definitely worth the trek!
Loved the food here! Came here for dinner with the family on a Friday early evening (5:45pm) and was seated immediately. FYI- Mostly family with little kids eating at this time so come early if you don't want to wait. We had the calamari salad to start and chicken with waffles, crab cake for entree. The calamari salad is fried calamari mixed into mesclun greens with feta, olives and banana peppers. This was so delicious! They give a lot of calamari so definitely share this or get it as a main. Chicken and waffles- deliciously season chicken (not dry) over crisp fluffy waffles. Just remember to take a pic (for IG) as soon as this dish comes out and take the hot chicken off the waffle! If not, the heat will cause the chicken to be less crispy and the waffles to start getting soft.  Crab cake - yes singular! You get 1 cake on top of asparagus spears, side salad and corn with bean salsa. This was good with real crab meat and not a lot of fillers but not sure if it's worth $25.  The one thing that bothered us was the service. They only bought 2 small glasses of water for me and my husband and didn't bring anything for my 4.5 year old daughter. Plus they never came by to refill our water unless the half bottle of stale water on our table was it. Honestly couldn't figure out if that was for decor? For the vase of flowers? Or for us to drink?
Great new addition to the neighborhood. Gorgeous place with large windows tucked away in the part of LIC that still seems industrial. Small menu of cocktails, beers, and small plates. The Gold Rush was delicious.
Just spent like $100 having two 3 course meals with my girlfriend and a bottle of wine.  The appetizers were decent (nothing special.  Calamari and stuffed mushrooms) our bolognese was really good,  and we had the veal and steak.  (Low quality meat, very chewy and badly seasoned) our wine was really good I'll admit.  But what threw me off was, we were sat right next to the register area,  in which the staff was play fighting,  singing out loud,  and our wine pour had no presentation. Also the garbage can was pressed up against the drawer that held the extra silverware, so when you need an extra fork,  they move the can with their bare hand and grab the silverware without washing their hands first.  (Gross) this is my first time to NYC, and I have to say, we do Italian way better back home in Chicago.
The meat was very tender and juicy, however I did not like the Asian style chicken wings, way too spicy for my liking. And the line is soooooooo long, good thing we came with a lot of people while people waited in line we waited for seats. It's a self serve kinda place so you grab the seats as they open up. Make sure you try their banana pudding. It was my favorite of the meal!
Started out with a group of five to check out Carmines, but the wait was very long for five people   Vs. 4 people.  I decided to find another spot nearby and came across Traytoria Trecolori on Yelp and sat at the bar.  The staff was warm and welcoming even when I called to check on availability.  I could even watch a game at the bar :). Caesar salad was just right and I was moved to try the chicken parmigiana because of a picture I saw on Yelp and it was delish.  Price was right!  Food was good !  Service was great !  Will be on my list for ny and theater visits ...
The food was excellent. But it ended there. The chairs were completely uncomfortable. I couldn't wait to leave and it was noisy. I could barely hear my husband from across the two-top table.  And on top of that, the waiter took FOREVER to bring us a check.  We would get carry out again, but nothing more.
So delicious. My friend and I started with the steamed beef buns and shared the shrimp pad Thai and basil chicken. Very authentic and super flavorful. Worth the wait! The service is quick and efficient. Probably my favorite Thai spot in NYC.
We came here ready to eat and see what we had seen on the tv about it. We found street parking a block away. We drove from Suffolk County, so we were really hungry. We ordered the lobster boil, small tomato chowder, salty dog and 2 lemonades. My son had the salty dog and asked for the slaw on the side. The slaw is made with little mayonnaise and seasoned with rye or pumpernickel seeds. The slaw was good since the dog is made from pork and served with creamy mayo horseradish and mustard. The lobster boil had a lobster 1 1/2 lb., one corn cob cut in half, 2 potatoes, shrimp, oysters, clams and a sausage cut lengthwise. The boil was good, I would have preferred a bit more seasoning. The lobster was delicious, you could appreciate it's natural taste and the experience was accentuated with the melted / clarified butter in a cup served with it. My son stopped eating his dog to eat the lobster! The sausage should be put in the boil before serving so as to not loose color, texture and flavor. Our meals were accompanied with fries with skins...good. My husband also had the tomato lobster chowder. I didn't order one thinking it would be similar to a Manhattan Chowder which I don't go crazy for. Well, to my surprise this version was CREAMY and slight tomato, no metal after taste and nice chuncks of lobster. My husband ordered one extra to take home. Overall, nice decor like SpongeBob meets Brooklyn. The service and staff was super friendly and great music. We spent an average of $25 per person. They take credit cards. Look, if you appreciate fresh natural flavors and want to pay mid to high, than rhis is it. We have paid more for less quality at City Island, Long Island and Florida. Give it a try...then go around the corner for chocolate, whiskey or key lime pie!
"The rolls tasted alright, sure. But the size does not match the price. Other lobster shacks ""hook"" you on not only a better tasting maine lobster roll, but on their sheer size making the roll worthy of the 15-18 dollar price tag. Here, the rolls come on a mini hotdog style bun. One roll here is the size of a snack and certainly not the size of a satisfying lunch. Sadly, I won't be coming back because I would rather pay a dollar more for a lobster roll that is twice the size with three times the flavor, elsewhere."
C'mon now. You already know what you're getting into. Soup dumplings are what they're known for but their other stuff is just as delicious. Greasy, oily plates of good old comfort food.  The dumplings are great in whatever form - soup, steamed or fried. Then make sure to add the pan-fried noodles or the scallion pancakes w/ beef...so friggin moist and warm and crunchy.  Waiting on line has never been a problem for me, although I tend to come for dinner on weeknights. They've been rapidly expanding so there's a lot of room, although I hear weekends are a killer and there can be a bit of a wait during prime lunch hours. But still worth it. Service is a bit lacking and communication can be a bit of a problem sometimes, but not for their lack of trying. Who cares when the prices are this cheap!? Cash onlyyyyyyyy
The food was amazing. I had the hanger steak and it was cooked to perfection at medium rare. The steal was tasty and the handcut fries were fresh and had the perfect crisp to it. Unfortunately, no matter how good the food was, I couldn't find myself enjoying its quality while I was eating due to the notion that the host (male) was extremely rude. He was demanding and not a very personable character to me and my group of friends. If he treated everyone with the same manner, then we can conclude that he was either having a bad day or it's just how he is. If it's the latter, then maybe being a host at a restaurant deserves a reconsideration. In fact, it didn't seem like either possibilities. He was extremely nice to several groups of people while showing no care for others. Perhaps the difference in service has a correlation with how often we come, but as far as running a business, this might be detrimental to the business. Despite how good the food was, I cannot see myself coming back and eating here when he's on duty.
Came to try the new place out with a group of friends on Sunday night. Maybe we came on a off day because we don't know how the place has such rave reviews. We ordered brussel sprouts, shrimp avocado salad, mushroom soups and corn as appetizers. The soup was the best part. Do not try the squid ink or uni pasta! Stench was so bad it was inedible. None of it was fresh. The boil itself was okay. Bill came out to $250 and we left the restaurant hungry. *btw- they charge for refills on soft drinks. We were charged $3 a cup for seltzer. Place was definitely not worth the trip.
Whenever I tell my friends I have yet to try Saigon, I always get the same reaction: wide eyes and open mouth in disbelief. Yeah, I get that it's a mecca for NYU kids, but like, I just never made it out--sorry?  So when I was deciding on takeout and wanted some hefty protein, as well as an excuse to be in the Macdougal area, I dialed Saigon. Ordered the grilled pork chops over rice--only $9.80 for a generous amount of food!! No wonder this place gets all the college students. Brought the food back to eat in the comfort of my own home, while sporting my PJs. But to my disappointment, the pork was dry and lacking flavor... However, I loved all the fresh veggies (cucumbers, bean sprouts, and lettuce) and pickled carrots + daikon that came with the hearty rice. Pour on some fish sauce and it's comfort food to the finest. Just wouldn't hype it up to the level that all my friends and locals do... Sadly, I'm not a fan of pho-- I know, you can give me the wide eyes and open mouth reaction again. But I'd be willing to come back and try their bahn mi and other rice dishes.
Spring rolls were great, but small portion (same for miso soup). I ordered the lunch special box with vegetables. Not the best selection of vegetables, but the brocoli was good. Fried rice was not good, but the rice in my companions chicken bowl was delicious. The price was great, and te interior was nice, but the food wasn't the best.
Dope soundtrack, delicious food, and beautiful environment. Tip: make a reservation AFTER 5pm so you can try the pad Thai pancake. ;)
I LOVE all things Italian. Food, cars, men. I can go on. I found this place a bit ridiculous. First, it is so crowded and it is set up incorrectly. It's an awkward jumbled mess.  Expect to get knocked aside and some very snooty sneering. Okay, I get it. It's New York and there are tons of tourists. I was stunned by the pricing (gouging) going on here. Are they nuts? It is actually not at all representative of an Italian market. Lemon soda, pasta and salami can be had at Trader Joes! We had two coffees and two cookies. $25.00 with tip. No receipt so when there was a mix up, it was a production. Great espresso but it did not have to turn into an awkward interaction.  I've been wanting to visit so it was a wonderful surprise that we found ourselves there. The coffee was excellent but I can't see returning for a cup of coffee. Maybe it's just too precious. I was put off.
3.5 Came here twice during one week once for breakfast and then once for dinner. I would say breakfast is a lot better , dinner felt more on the just okay side. I really enjoyed their chicken prego sandwich and malva pudding. I felt like everything was just mediocre. I heard a lot of awesome things about the rose water waffle don't get me wrong it was good we ate it , but we had to use all the syrup because the waffle was super dry, I also wish you got more of a rose water kick in there cause it basically was just a regular waffle. But I will give props for service being super friendly no matter how busy it was.  AND DEF TRY THEIR HOT SAUCE!
Really liked this place! The environment and the service is great! Good food too. It's more like a $$$ instead of a $$
No doubt the food is good but there are consequences when you walk out of The Boil!!! It will leave your stomach feeling queasy and greasy but I had no choice because my friends wanted to celebrate her birthday there.  They all warned me about the uncomfortable feeling I will get, so I prepared a week in advanced and stay committed to becoming a vegetarian for a week. I'm glad I've been eating mainly just salads before I had this delicious but deadly creole Cajun seafood, otherwise I would have gained 10 pounds or so.  Now, enough of the nonsense. Honestly speaking the size of the shrimp and snow crab were huge and filling. However, you might want to skip the clams because the shells were heavy and the meat all fell out of the clams. Our table ordered 12lbs of seafood with the garlic butter and the boil sauce. All the sauces taste great but was a little too oily and salty for my liking.  You can either be in heaven or hell when consuming the food. I thought I was in heaven when I first took a bite and then if you were like me, I got too greedy and started feasting on those shrimps and crabs..and before I knew it...I felt like I was in hell, my stomach didn't feel so well. I went home and took 3x poo and the shrimp really got to me, I ended up curling like a shrimp in bed. Even the next morning I felt sick. No more boil for me until next year. Just a warning, if you ever do consider eating it, don't eat too much.
The food wasn't great and the drinks were horrible. Definitely won't come here again. I gave them two stars for have good service.
"We came here last night for an early Valentine's Day dinner. Buddakan has been on my list of restaurants to check out for quite some time, so I was very excited. When we first entered through their ginormous doors, the restaurant looked and felt like what I imagined it to be: dim lighting, hip remixes... it screams ""Manhattan trendy""! So in terms of the restaurant's look, feel, and service- 5/5. For apps, I originally wanted to order the dim sum tasting for 2, and swap out a few of the seafood items (as another Yelper suggested),  but the waiter told me I might as well order a la carte. To be honest, I was majorly disappointed with the food. I get that I'm paying for the atmosphere, but a lot of the dishes we ordered weren't even that great. This would have gotten a 3/5, but because of how much I liked the restaurant itself, it got a 4. Pork Belly buns: Delicious! As a pork belly bun addict, this dish delivered and with a bit of a twist (spicy shallots). My boyfriend doesn't typically eat pork, and he devoured his! General Tso's Dumplings: Ehh, I would take a pass on this. My boyfriend didn't like the taste either. It's too sweet and the texture was too rough. Black Dragon Chicken: YUCK! Have you ever eaten something expecting it to taste a certain way, but it ending up tasting like something else... and how disgusting it made you feel? Well, I was expecting to taste chicken, but instead I tasted rubbery smoked pork. This chicken has the same smokiness you would expect from bacon or smoked salmon. I found it utterly disgusting! Charred Filet of Beef: We thought this was delicious! The meat is good on it's own, but the mustard sauce really makes this dish. My boyfriend ate the beef without the sauce (typical). Wonton crisps were also very good. Vegetable Rice: The rice was good; the curry okay. For the okay-ness and how small the portion was... $13? Should have just ordered white rice. Truce: I would definitely pass on this another time. I wanted something refreshing but this tasted like one of those lemon grass shots you get at a smoothie place. Solid: A solid whisky drink... ;) Clarity: Delicious! Haven't had a good drink like this in a while... Despite some total misses on the food, I'd definitely want to come back with my girls (who actually eat seafood) to try out some other dishes. Maybe that'll change my rating to a 5...!"
Yum, yum, yum. Still love this place. Popped in on a week night, barely any line. Tried the lamb belly which was excellent, and of course the brisket is still my forever and always. We tried the potato salad, meh. But the KOREAN STICKY RIBS **cue the angelic chorus,** excellent excellent excellent.
Place is still working out kinks, really hope they get there.  Food quality seems mediocre. Water refills require requests  Bredsticks require request Place is gorgeous  Maybe the issue is understanding
"This restaurant canceled my reservation today (made 2 weeks in advance via OpenTable), 5 hours before my reservation due to a ""private event."" Extremely unprofessional. You could've at least notified me a day prior and not the day OF!"
"Last night I went to Colonia Verde with my girlfriend for the first time. Our waiter's attitude was remarkably bad, he seemed almost annoyed at having to serve us. He wasn't very knowledgeable about the questions we had about the food, and could say almost nothing about the wine we asked about. He forgot to put in the order for one of the dishes we ordered. My girlfriend is vegetarian so her only option for an entree was the fettuccine, which was totally tasteless and the noodles were overcooked. We both thought that this dish was a ripoff at $18 for only noodles and a few soggy vegetables. I had a salad with halloumi, the cheese seemed like it had been left out and was not even warm, though it was described as ""grilled"". It too was overpriced, small and bland. The wine portions seemed too small. To top this all off the waiter dropped a fork on my back when he was cleaning off the table. He didn't say sorry and just left the fork on the ground. Overall this was a pretentious, awkward, and overpriced dining experience. Terrible."
Maybe this place has great reviews for brunch, but my review is solely for dinner.  We had made a reservation the night of our dinner, and they had tables open all night. Our waiter was really cool and nice, but the hostess had a bit of an attitude.... The majority of this review is for the food. We LOVED the cocktails (I ordered the blueberry lemonade), but we tried many different dishes from the dinner menu and the only good one was the crispy cauliflower. The octopus dish was a little tough, and the bed of beans was flavored very strangely. The ribs were very saucy, but didn't have much flavor at the same time?? Our fried pickles were mostly bread, and didn't quite taste like pickles at all. The duck pate dish was bland and not interesting at all, and the cheesesteak spring rolls were also nothing special. Perhaps happy hour and brunch are great here, by there are better places to go for dinner in this area.
Had the Valentine's Day tasting menu. One of the best meals me or my girlfriend has ever had. The type of meal that stays in your head long, long after the first bite.  Highlights: butterfish sashimi with truffle/foie risotto, and of course, the bacon donuts (the perfect dessert, in my opinion).
"A prominent Yelper wrote that Traif was his favorite restaurant.  At the time, he reviewed 700 or 800 restaurants.  I wouldn't go as far to say this is my favorite restaurant, but it comes close.  And if I wanted to impress friends with the NYC culinary scene, it's hard to do better than Traif. Ambiance is dark, muted, and intimate.  The tables are not bumped up next to each other (a pet-peeve of mine) so you're not engaged in your neighbor's conversation.  Very date appropriate.  Another prominent Yelper said there was a TV (another pet peeve of mine).  Either it was missing or wasn't on, since I didn't notice it. The 2nd Yelper went on to say that while the food is delicious, it lacks subtlety, balance, and complexity.  I agree with this sentiment. Yes, the food is prepared with a dwarven mace rather than an elven bow.   Yes, the flavors are bold and apologetic.  Like a jpeg image where the color saturation is set to full to produce an almost cartoonish effect.  But it's a restaurant whose foundations are built on pork and shellfish.  You're not exactly coming here for subtlety. Service was perfect.  Our waitress was a bit flirty in a friendly way and very interactive.  Helpful in food selection.  Attentive despite the place being packed. Food style is tapas.  The dishes are small and easily shareable.  I think it works best if you're 3 or 4 people.  More than 4 and some of the dishes will have to be cut a bit too small.  Less than 3 and it becomes less of a tapas sized serving.  I went with my cuñado and my wife.  We ordered 8 dishes.  I entered a food coma at dish 6 and couldn't eat the last two dishes.  The best strategy is to order 2 dishes per person and then order as you go from there. Hampshire Pork Belly: A The perfect pork belly.  Presented beautifully which belies the fact that you're eating delicious fatty pork fatmeatfat.  If you like greasy fatty pork belly, this is it, but served as a gourmet looking dish.  Served with a salsa of tomato, leek, sugar snaps, asiago, cheddar, and bacon.  Yes, Virginia.  There's bacon crumbled onto the pork belly.  It's the 8th wonder of the world and the bane of the pig world. Strawberry Cinnamon Baby Back Ribs: A The glaze was a hair sweeter than I like, but the meat was soft enough to be cut easily with a fork and expertly cooked.  The meat has a great sear due to the caramelized strawberry sugars. Short-Rib Sliders: A These are great pulled pork sliders.  My brother-in-law is Cuban/Honduran, and said that this was better than any Cuban pulled pork we could think of.  The bread was as soft as an angel's butt.  Comes with sweet potato fries (perhaps fried in bacon fat?) and a smoked paprika aioli (like a chipotle).  PROTIP: You're supposed to use the aioli with the fries, but it goes FANTASTICALLY on the sliders as well!!! Pork Cheeks: A Soft and fatty.  Served on a bed of grain I couldn't identify, a starchy vegetable I couldn't identify, and dolops of green lentil soup. Bacon Fat Focaccia: B The only thing on the menu I didn't love.  Matteo R. said the food was cooked without subtlety or balance.  I agree somewhat, and this is what happens when you do that.  This dish would be great in another context, but next to such larger than life dishes of pure sweet pork indulgence, it seemed very plain.  PROTIP: Skip this one.  It's great, but you have so many other things to try! Broccoli Rabe: A- Cooked in bacon grease.  The chef was able to cook it to the point of being very soft but still very broccoli rabe flavored. Spring Cassoulet: B Good, but not on par with the other dishes.  Sausages were a bit plain.  Good polenta, though. Dayboat Scallops: A+ Served on a bed of snap & english pea risotto and topped with a lemon-caper brown butter and a tomato chive salsa.  As an ex-physicist researcher, I'm intelligent enough to (mostly) stay away from works like ""the most"" or ""the least"" or ""the best/worst"", but I will make an exception here.  This was the best scallop dish I've ever had anywhere.  It was the most expertly cooked, most expertly presented scallops.  Anywhere.  This blows away any seafood restaurant I've been to in NY, SF, DC, or Tokyo. Braided Bread: A Served gratis.  A delicious braided bread, soft and warm, served with a ricotta spread and a bacon/bacon bit marmalade.  PROTIP: This is nice to start your meal with. Keylime Pie: A I didn't care for the pineapple marmalade, but the dollop of cream was a beautiful addition.  The pie itself was perfect as was the graham crust. Bacon Doughnuts: A Sweet bacon glaze with bacon crumbles on a perfect doughnut.  PROTIP: You'll be sorry if you don't get this. Coffee: A No espresso, but the coffee is marvelous.  It's oddly difficult finding good coffee at NYC restaurants."
Their Brunch/happy hour is for really skinny people :(. We went in starving and they had toast really overpriced
Ordered the Paris Burger and the Herbed Chicken. Waitress forgot about us. Clientele wearing button-downs.
The best lobster roll and most scenic view in all of the United States. There I said it. You are a heathen if you disagree.
A truly disappointing meal. Everything was completely mediocre - the drinks, the wine, and especially the food. We ordered the cheese and it was not even Fairway quality - underwhelming.... They served my husband a raw pork chop. Hard to understand these positive reviews on yelp.
"Damn....I really wanted to like this venue. Had high hopes consider some of the reviews and the enthusiastic hostess. She had so much energy. We just finished a summerstage concert and looking for a good meal that wasn't too depressing on the UWS and Bustan was definitely busy that Saturday evening. We didn't have reservation but the hostess was going to set us for at the bar which sounded fun but this couple in front of us that had a reservation changed mind for some unknown reason and we scored their table.  So let's get to my rationale for the 1 star. 1. The waiter (Radu) couldn't have been more of a ""D"". He was arrogant and outright rude. First, he was rude to us when we didn't like wine we asked to sampled. In fact, he made a scene asking how we could not like it.  We thought he was joking but he wasn't.  2. He got all our orders wrong. We asked for three hummus to accompany the amazing facaccia bread. They only served us one hummus which was fine and we thoroughly enjoyed it. When we told him that we ordered three hummus, he quickly snapped at us and said ""no, you didn't"". We actually didn't care because the one hummus we ate was amazing with the freshly baked facaccia but was shocked by his attitude. 3. He also forgot our salad. At this point, we thought the bread was more than sufficient for our appetite so we simply ignore his memory lapse. 4. He pretty much ignore our a few requests such as more water or black pepper. At one point as we were in the middle of asking him a question, he turned when he recognized a friend's voice at the bar and he went over to hug and converse with her. It was pretty clear that he didn't give a crap about us or the other tables because we noticed other patrons getting annoyed with him as well. If there was time when the owner should consider firing someone...this was the time. 2. The entrees were not good. Perhaps it was poorly described to us by Radu. The Saganaki which was basically melted kefalograviera cheese over roasted squash marinated with brandy and spice was inedible. It was super sweet squash soaked in super sweet cheese. If this sound horrible, imagine eating and paying for it. The Lamb Terrracotta was exactly as described on the menu and nothing like what Radu described. It was spiced ground lamb kebab, charred onion, tomato, sumac roasted peppers, tahini & pine nuts baked in a flaky bread dome. Not only was that weird but also the grounded lamb was bland. No spice in the world could have save this dish and it was pretty much doom from inception. Who would ground up lamb to begin with...it's like serving hamburger meat. I had no one to blame for this one because despite what Radu described, this was clearly described on the menu - lesson learned. 3. The decor from the outside had promise but once inside...nothing made sesne. There were odd pictures of JFK, Marilyn Monroe and art deco furniture everywhere. If there was a middle eastern theme...I missed it. It was a very dated look and reminded me of the UWS in the 90s. Maybe we should have ordered something else. The one hostess that greeted with a big smile and facaccia bread were the two things worth mentioning for this sad and expensive venue. I wish the price matched the quality of service and food but it didn't :(  Too bad there's no zero star rating option on yelp."
Would rate this restaurant as somewhere between mediocre and disappointing. Came for dinner on Friday 09/29/2017 around 8:30pm. Dinner rush was ending. Took very long just to get our drink orders and finally when it was time to order our food, waiter had to come back several times to confirm (not sure why he didn't just write down our order?). Food was bland and mediocre. Quite disappointing since the ratings were good on Yelp. Staff did not once top off water, ask if we wanted more drinks, or check to see if we need anything. We ordered the dessert, but waiter came back and said they ran out of it - which is fine, because it probably wasn't any good. Oh well. The place probably stays open because it's well located. Don't waste your time or your money here. We won't be coming back -- there are plenty of other options Seaport.
Went on a Saturday night. Unfortunately the pork belly that I wanted ran out by the time we got there at 730pm. Heard a lot of great things about this place so wanted to try. Let me begin listing all the food we had in the order of what I thought was the best to my least favorite. Meats 1. BEEF RIB $28/lb. (Absolutely amazing! Entire chunk was succulent and moist! A must) 2. Bacon thick cut (Juicy, fatty, tender) 3. Vietnamese hot wings (3x) 4. Korean Sticky Rib 5. Pulled pork 6. Brisket (I actually thought this was pretty terrible. Dry) Sides 1. Mac&cheese (cheesy) 2. Baked beans (has some chunks of meat) 3. Potatoe salad (like a cold mash) 4. Cold slaw (basic) 5. Corn bread (this was disappointing to me personally because I like my born bread a bit more Cornish like Boston markets, but this one was more caky) I enjoyed mixing all the sides together and chomping it down. Overall, I think I enjoyed dinosaur bbq or mighty Quine more. The only 2 things I'd maybe come back for is the BEEF RIB, and maybe the bacon slice. And perhaps go back to try the lamb belly.
Cool Hand Lu says:  Another reason why I love Japanese cuisine.  Could go bigger on the portions though... Might just be the American in me. Met a cousin here for dinner as it was a selection within close proximity for them and a cuisine we both liked.  Previous reviews allowed me to take a chance on a new restaurant.  Thankfully I was mostly happy with my choice.  The staff was friendly upon my entering and while I waited. The restaurant is small but doesn't feel cramped. Tip...The lighting was a little dim which made it cozy but more suitable if I was meeting a date.   It has a decent sized bar but too many people I'm sure will make it feel small and cramped.  We ordered the anchovy fried potatoes, creamy baked salmon, and a donburi bowl. The meals were each enough for one, except the fried potatoes when was the appetizer.  That was naturally pretty salty because of the anchovies, but was really tasty. My salmon was cooked perfectly and delicious.  Of course being a grown man and American I'm used to bigger portions.  In this case it was less being greedy and more of it tasted that good that I just wished there was more.  The upside was that I left feeling relatively full and not stuffed. All in all, I had a great meal and will keep this place in mind for a nice dinner and relaxing atmosphere, especially if on a date.
The bartender is extremely rude!!! A guy with brown hair and beard, I ordered two Mai Thai from him first and he repeated my order but after 10 mins he hasn't started making it. Then I checked with him about Mai Thai and my other friends wanted order more drinks, he said get your folks ready then talk to me. Then I got all the orders from my friends trying to talk to him again he said I already moved on because you didn't get all your orders ready.... so we ended up no drinks just took few pictures and left.... The WORSE and RUDEST bartender ever!!!
I was super hyped to check out Turntable Chicken after I've heard so much about it.  As another reviewer said, the chicken was good, not great.  The corn cheese was also good, not great, despite how delicious it looked.  The best part of the meal was the kimchi pancake which was nice and crisp.   The decor of the place is really awesome with records everywhere but man was it hot inside.  I thought they said the a/c was broken but then another hostess said that was just the way it was.   Glad I went, but probably wouldn't go back.  There are tastier places.
The fastest service ever with very nice servers. The only thing that was annoying was that they took plates when they were looking empty without asking. I actually had a bit more that I wanted to finish.  At the beginning the server looked irritated when I took two seconds to give him my order. That wasn't nice.  But the food was amazingly good!
Very unimpressed! OK service with OK food. They give you a pretty big portion with soba and rice bowl combo; note, you don't have to get a soba! If you order without it I think it was about three dollars cheaper. I came during lunch on a Friday. It was crowded but we were immediately seated. I ordered the Kaisen don and the plain soba. The soba was good but I could equally create the taste at home. I was so excited for the don but the portion of uni and the crab meat was scant. The uni was also not fresh so it smelled. Would not come back :(
If you're looking for the usual pad thai or pad kee mao, keep looking. But if you want a more authentic Thai experience and are willing to eat adventurously, I'd definitely recommend this place. RATCHABURI CRAB AND PORK DRY NOODLES. These are made with HOMEMADE egg noodles. This is a must try item. I love the noodles! The first time I ordered it, it was a bit salty, so for my second visit, I ordered it with the sauces on the side and that was perfect. PUMPKIN STICKY RICE. Skip the traditional mango sticky rice for this unexpected, mouthwatering combination of flavors. The sticky rice is topped with a pumpkin bread puree bathed in coconut milk. The dessert disappeared within seconds. (This dessert is on the specials menu, so it's not always there.) Since I went to Thailand on vacation a few years ago, I've been scouring the city for the best Thai restaurants. Pure Thai Cookhouse is definitely on the top of my list.
This is my first time at Soco and I have to say I LOVE IT! I will definitely come back.  The place is so nice inside and everyone is friendly and welcoming.   As soon as my friends and I walked in we were greeted and we didn't have to wait for a Friday night around 630p.  If you come a little later there might be a wait but it's worth it.  When we sat down we ordered Soco Island and the Mardi Gras ( Sooo Good).  We didn't order appetizers but everything sounded good. For entrees we ordered the chicken & waffles but since I'm not such a red velvet fan I was able to substitute the waffles for mash and collard greens which were amazing and my other friend had the salmon burger which was so good too.  We also got the Mac and cheese which was so delicious. - probably the best I've had.  The service was great.  Sasha was attentive and so friendly.  I will definitely come back here.
This place is horrible. Waiting for seats, waiting for drinks, waiting for food. I am falling asleep waiting; it has been 3 hours and I only ate 1 chicken wing with the worse sweet potato fries ever. Still waiting for our food to come as I write this. No one gave us any plates...basically eating on top of a napkin. Rude servers. Uncomfortable stool seats with no where to put your jacket. Do not come here!   You will be disappointed!!!
We did not have a good experience, service-wise, at Da Andrea. Our party was just missing one person and there was no chance of them seating us. This would have been totally fine and normal if it wasn't the beginning of a bad pattern of the party being treated rudely throughout the night.  We had with us two international students who did not speak English very well and had a lot of questions about the menu; in fact, they had never had any Italian food other than pizza. As such, they had a hard time recognizing and pronouncing the words on the menu. Which we helped them with, but the service again was somewhat lacking in offering their knowledge on the menu.  When it came time to order, the service was at its lowest point: the two international students were having trouble pronouncing the entire menu item and stopped to point at the entry on the menu, which earned them a stare from the service - 'It's restaurant policy that you can't take an order by pointing.' At which point the other members of our party chimed in, and reminded the waitress that they were international students, which got us all the same stare and admonition.  One possible solution to the 'pointing' problem: move around the table to the student to see what he is trying to show! This didn't happen- instead the server just stood in the same place and talked down to us all. Restaurant policy was also, apparently, not even at least guessing which item they were pointing at and trying to narrow it down. We could have just yelled our orders into the kitchen too! It was so confusing: we were all so excited to introduce our friends to Italian food, and had seen the outstanding reviews, and suddenly we were trying to explain why the service here was being so condescending to us all. Except we couldn't. Slow on the water refills, barely any check-in after the food was brought. Also - other tables got plates for their bread and olive oil. Us? None. Nobody in sight to ask about it, either.  Anyway, the food was still good - I got the whole wheat pasta with the sage sauce. But the idea of going back there is absolutely laughable right now.
Noodles noodles noodles noodles noodles.  This place isn't shy about letting you know that they make noodles.  The dough-smacking noodle maker is even closer to the dining area than the kitchen!   The dish to get here is definitely one of their noodle soups.  The broth is rather light and really lets the noodles shine, which you definitely get a bigger mound of than at a ramen or pho place.  They take way more chews than your average noodle to get through, and this lets you appreciate the soup's flavor a lot more.  I recommend throwing in some of the communal chili oil. Dumplings are also pretty decent and very cheap.   Unfortunately, this place seems more and more crowded each time I go because of the publicity it's gotten the past few years, leading to some negative experiences.  I think it lives up to the hype as long as you temper your expectations.  Although it won't change the way you look at food forever, it does serve some of the best no-bs, no-pretense Chinese classics in the area.
We cam where on a Sunday night and got fried calamari and chops with Sala and guacamole for appetizer and they were horrible.  Calamari was chewy and the chips were over fried and tasted nasty.  Guacamole was favor less compare to what I am usually used to.  We were hoping that the entree can save the day but the steak was horrible along with the lamb.  The only thing that was good was the tostada.  Would not come here again.
Love Glasserie and the vibe. Been a few times in the past, it's a reliable go-to for an impressive meal out if you like your company enough to share food. Felt compelled to review since some things were outstanding while some could have been better...  Split a bunch of things in a group of three, here's what netted out: - Griddle bread and labneh - could go just for this. It's siren call brings me back time and again. Flaky, buttery pastry-like bread and rich, tarty labneh is consistent win for brunch or dinner.  - Chanterelles and corn with egg- total favorite of the table, amazing flavor, recommend a spoon to get at that sauce. - Lamb skewer with tomatoes and okra- had a ratatouille veg thing going on, meat was cooked on a cinnamon stick and tender, flavors all worked, definite win.  - Chicken liver mousse- kind of overcrowded with a medley of vegetable garnish on top and not as flavorful as others I've had. Needed salt? Port? Some sharper flavor? Not sure but could have been better.  - Monkfish- waiter recommended and we were a little disappointed, large chunks of cucumber (why), the fish was battered, and the cooked tomatoes didn't take advantage of their heirloom pedigree. Was not what we expected from menu description.  - Service-wise, the plates came out in two waves, and in an unexpected way (chicken liver mousse came out mid-meal as opposed to the top) and might have been a touch faster, but fine, we're relaxing. Despite the misses, I'll go back, since the winners outpaced the disappointments, as did the drinks and the ambience.
Our server was knowledgeable and polite. Kept it real with us about the menu, which I appreciated.  The soup dumplings were absolutely delicious. They were filled with a hefty portion of meat, and the consistency of the dough was perfect. The oxtail ramen was pretty good. The meat was extremely tender. With no bones, you didn't have to work for your food, as is sometimes the case with oxtail. The broth could've been more flavorful, but overall good dish. The noodle dish we ordered was decent. Nothing special, but solid.  The prices were very reasonable, especially for quality of food. Will definitely be back!
It's just not the​ same as before. No need to make a reservation a week or so before since there's still openings a few days prior. They don't serve the bread with the strawberry butter anymore. If they did, they totally forgot about us. The salmon egg benedict tasted pretty good along with the home fries. The vanilla french toast tasted mediocre. They used to charge more for the strawberry and bananas, but now it's included in the dish. However, the bananas were not fresh and were actually bruised too. The waiter seems like he was rushing us and wanted us to leave.
Tried to eat there 3-11...... waited over an hour for the food, waitress kept telling us they were plating the food. When we got our order 98% of it was stone cold. The owner did try to heat it up and offer us food at another date. As someone who lived in Texas all I wanted was good BBQ and I didn't get it
This place was a big disappointment. Here's some backstory for those who need backstories (otherwise just skip down). Three of my friends and I were shopping at the Brooklyn Ikea and were planning to get those hyped up meat balls that they serve. However, we spent too much time sleeping on their beds and buying lamps that it's already 9pm and their cafeteria is closed. Well damn. So we searched yelp and within a mile radius was this place. We were convinced by their pictures. It made it look nice and cozy... Now onto the real review: We were confused when we arrived about the ordering  and seating process but the cook in the front was friendly enough to tell us the procedure. He said because the menu is so limited, everything is good. Yeah okayyyyyyy! We ordered the fish filet, fish taco, oyster thing, and the clam roll. They gave us a device which buzzed when our food is ready so that was pretty cool. While we waited, we went inside to check out the place.  Yelp reviews had said that they had a nice backyard... It was nice but there were so many fallen blueberries everywhere that we couldn't find a bench that wouldn't ruin our clothes so we headed back inside the bar. We found a nicely secluded and cozy, fake candlelit, table and waited a sufficiently long time for our food. We played games to surpass the time. When the thing buzzed, my friend went out to the front to get our tray... Wow, our food was small. Pretty much similar to sampler sizes. We waited a long time for so little food. We were so hungry! Worst part is, the food wasn't even good! None of us liked our respective orders. The food actually made two my friend's stomachs hurt. I'd rather eat fast food than pay for the overpriced food here. That way we could actually get full (true story we went to McDonald's after this place).  TL;DR:  would not go back. Nice atmosphere (that's what the one star is for), the cook was friendly, and the bartender was okay. But come on... Terrible and overpriced food for what you get. Trust me, I'm Asian.
Too bad I can't judge the food but the service is horrible. Maybe it's because we were too Spanish for them but that white waitress with the dark hair needs to get a job where she doesn't have to deal with customers. Never again back to that place.
"Its really hard to find good tacos. I really like authentic tacos. Authentic as it can be. I also like spicy tacos. My favorite is chorizo and I am usually very picky. I also have a mexican background so I really judge any restaurant that claims it sells ""mexican food"". I googled this place and saw the reviews and I thought it wasnt bad. I like the interior decoration. We sat down and what really threw me off was the fact that we had to order using a piece of paper. Next to the menu item we had to write the amount we wanted. This kinda disconnected the clients from creating a bond with the server. We ordered and another server picked up the paper. I had two chorizo tacos and my sister had carne asada tacos and two tacos de chorizo and jarritos. I really LOVE my chorizo spicy so it was very dissapointing when I took a bite of my taco. It was sweet. Too sweet. I still finished my taco. My sister liked her carne asada taco. We asked for the check because we werent really enjoying ourselves and my sister couldnt finish her tacos de chorizo that she ordered because they were too sweet for her. They did use real corn tortillas. We left really dissapointed."
The was such a tasty unexpected find in the neighborhood.  I was surprised with how nice and large the space was I really felt like I was not in nyc.  The food was so good.  The corn soup such good flavor, wanted two of these, it has a unique impression served in a jar.  The calamari had great flavor and was served on finally an adequate amount of greens and tomatoes.  The burger was great and had good seasoning.  Served was potato wedges that actually have been seasoned correctly and cooked through.  The manager Dan was professional and helpful.  The only reason it was not five stars was one burger did not come out with the other due to a glitch in the computer.  I will come back and glad it is a place in the neighborhood.  Great food and service.
This review is because they took an extra 25 minutes beyond the delivery time. I understand it is super cold but they should use a car to deliver not a bike delivery man. The food was extremely cold and not edible. Even after speaking with the customer service, a refund was not provided. We just paid 30 bucks for food that we couldn't eat. It only takes one bad experience!
"They have an amazing HH menu and I enjoyed my time here however...I am giving 1 star because one of their bar tenders swapped my credit card with someone else's. When I realized I had the wrong card, I was blocks away and had to turn around, cancel my plans, and walk back to the restaurant. Really inconvenient especially since this was on a Saturday night. When I returned the strangers credit card that I was given, the manager said she'd call me after her shift to let me know if my card was found. I never received a call. I had to call 3 times the next morning to see if they found it and of course they didn't. They refunded my $7 drink at the bar but didn't even offer to comp my meal for their terrible mistake! Instead the manager (who I finally got on the phone with) told me ""you can cancel your card we didn't find it"". I won't be returning."
Got the bulgogi with purple rice and tofu. Not bad but beef needed more liquid and tofu sauce was rather dull: oil and scallions and garlic. Rice was very good flavor and texture: cooked just right! More flavor and juice and they'd have a winner!
Yaso Tangbao was quite an interesting experience. It kind of reminded me of dimsum/yumcha but you order at the register first and they call you up when your food is ready.  My party was made of 6 people and we definitely over ordered! Lets see if I can remember everything we got.  Pork/ Crab & Pork / Spicy Pork Soup Dumplings: Okay... I personally thought the skin of the dumplings was too thick. It was hard to just bite into them to suck out the soup so it ended up spilling into my paper dish.  Vegetable Dumpling: Pretty flavorful but once again skin was too thick.  Cold Noodles (peanut sauce): Noodles were too thick and not al dente. There also wasn't enough sauce in my opinion.  Pork Meatball: Very flavorful, kinda fatty, and extremely greasy.  Sweet and Sour Ribs: Very good! The meat was seasoned very well. Highly recommend. Seasonal Garlic Fried Veggies: It was chinese broccoli for us. Very very garlicky and very very good! Definitely recommend.  Sweet Pumpkin Mochi w/ Coconut: Pretty good. Not a whole lot of pumpkin flavor if any. But the coconut was good. By the time I ate it it was cold so the mochi was pretty firm.  Chicken Curry Crispy Noodles: Chicken was very tender and well seasoned. Not a whole lot of curry flavor. Noodles were crispy tho.  Panfried Pork Bao: My sister loved this but I thought it was a little too oily.  Overall, pretty decent food. It's unique and is a good gateway to introduce traditional Chinese food to people who don't usually eat it. Service was quick though which is a plus. There was plenty of seating (community tables). And it is self service so place your trays and steamers near the trash after you're done. Don't forget to pour yourself some soy sauce and vinegar for your dumplings.
Food is just ok. Kinda yummy in a comfort food way but not cooked with love or care. Components were off, some things over salted, some under, some lacking acid, ingredients did not shine.  Fun atmosphere and an adorable concept but what was on the plate was not so good.
If you're going for the chicken and waffles don't waste your money. What I got was okay chicken and a pancake that was pressed in a waffle iron after it was made.  I had a craving for chicken and waffles. I was in the neighborhood so I went here because of other reviews. I wish I didn't. This was a complete waste of a cheat day. It took forever for our food to arrive even though there was only two other small groups when we walked in. When I went to the restroom I could smell that something had burned. This was perhaps the reason for the slow service.  When the food finally arrived I was extremely disappointed. The waffle looked a deflated ball and the chicken was eh.  I had some of my friends fries, they were really good. That's the reason for one of the two stars.  The server was nice. He was the only one working which was fine because it wasn't busy. Also he tried to be as attentive as possible. But he can't serve what isn't ready. He was the reason for the second star.  Sad to say, this place was a let down.
"Again, thanks Insider Food for this find!! This place blew up on Facebook for having their secret menu cheese shell tacos.  I freaking love this concept because I'm the kind of person who ""accidentally"" drops cheese on the pan when I'm cooking with cheese so I can eat all the cheese crisps on it's own (-:  This place incorporates the cheese crisps into the meal so you don't have to feel guilty about eating cheese on its own! I was surprised at the price of the taco for what seemed like an authentic Mexican taco shop, but I think the prices have to do with its location within Chelsea Market.  Each taco was about $5, but they're much larger than regular street tacos (if you get the cheese shell one).  I got the carne asada and pollo tacos as a snack and it was more than enough. I honestly expected the cheese shell to be somewhat soggy and soft but they did a great job of making sure the shell was crispy and just right.  Since it is cheese, the taco becomes a bit greasy and salty but you're really going for that unique concept!  Not only is the taco shell different, all their ingredients are very fresh and complimented the taco well.  The salsa is a little bit spicy , coming from someone who can't handle spice well."
It appears that Seafood is not served on Saturday or Sunday.   Without baked clams or mussels things become ordinary.  I wish I knew before we sat down.
Food was excellent and perfect serving amount! Wait staff was very courteous. Loved this place! We had the risotto, so yummy and my husband had the alfredo, perfect al dente on the noodles. we finished a bottle of rose sparkling wine and finished the night with a tiramisu!! Will be back again!
Came here because my friend and I were craving some good pub food and this place seems like a good fit. Boy, were we wrong! The food had no taste at all! I ordered bacon mac and cheese, I mean how can you go wrong with that? The texture was creamy but then had these huge chunks of cheese in it which didn't belong. Mac n cheese should be one texture thick or creamy, NOT BOTH. The mac n cheese barely had a taste to it, honestly a waste of calories! My friend ordered fish tacos, which seems delicious on the menu you but when they arrived , they were totally different! They were over fried and honestly had no taste other than tasting like a fryer! She had to send them back that's how bad they were! Only thing this place is good for is they're fries and their cider.
While visiting from LA, my boyfriend told me he found the best Italian restaurant in NYC and somehow landed us reservations. This restaurant went well above my expectations. Literally everything from the appetizers to the dessert was phenomenal. The service was great, and the waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the wine and the food. I can't wait to go back next time I'm in New York!
The first time I came here on a Sunday the bartender (male) was wonderful and very attentive. The pitcher we order was an entire bottle of champagne. We stayed longer than we intended because he was so awesome. The second time we came back (1/8/17) the bartender(female) was awful!!! Our pitcher of mimosa was a half bottle...I sat there and watched her pour half bottle pitchers for everyone people in the restaurant. She was completely aloof and didn't know any answers to the questions we asked about the menu. We ended up cashing out after the pitcher because she was so awful. I'd also like to mention it took her 15 mins to cash us at because she clearly lacks the skills to effectively manage a bar. Huge disappoint. I won't be returning.
NOT for a vegetarian. Had the vegetarian hot pot. bland, superrrr oily, flavorless. Not impressed. Maybe the other dishes with meat were better but, as a vegetarian, I would pass.
Somehow I never wrote a review when I lived around here 4 years ago, but we recently went back and the food has definitely gotten even better. (It was always good!) We had the jambalaya. I am no expert on this dish, but it was really delicious. We also got the fried chicken and red velvet waffle, so satisfying! The cornbread was good, but not my favorite in the city. The only thing I didn't love was the service. The waitress was a bit cold and absent. Never came to ask if we needed anything (until our food was almost gone).  This is also the type of place that has a manager walking around that clearly micromanages. Maybe I am overly sensitive to this since I've worked in restaurants in the past, but I hate when there is a weird uptight manager/maitre d' in everyone's business, especially in a place that is not fine dining. Always makes me wonder if the staff is miserable at work.
This was my second brunch of the day but I was still excited to try the food here! As soon as I walked in, I noticed that it was a small, tight and popular place and thought there would be a wait on a Friday afternoon, but we were seated right away. To get seated, the waitress pulled the table back for me to give me space to get into my seat. I loved the big paper menus with the cute designs that took up almost the whole table. We ordered the Rosewater waffle, Madame Freda, Green Shakshuka, which seemed to be some of most popular items on the menu. The Madame Freda was amazing and the waffle Green Shakshuka were good. I also ordered the orange juice which was also good. During the meal, I was feeling hot at some points because it was a small cozy restaurant but then felt cold because customers were constantly coming in and were opening the door.
Tried this out based on a local recommendation.  So many review so I had a good feeling.  We sat outside and the waitress was friendly. Burrata - fresh and good Pan seared cod-  smaller portion so if you are very hungry then keep that in mind.  Overall the dish was  ok.  The fish was good but the purée it sat on was not interesting at all.  The fish should be paired differently to make the dish come alive with flavor. Pork chop - a heartier meal.  The chop was ok.
They have done an amazing job with the space.  The drink menu was innovative and the drinks were strong, if small.  I was a glutton and had the french toast with nutella, which was delicious and my friend had a salad (which looked good).  Service was friendly and attentive.  This is a wonderful new addition to the neighborhood.
Quantity is good. Taste is mediocre. Not worth the wait to have very average food. Staff was very polite.
Well after a greeting from the meanest rudest hostess in a long time-- I was worried but no excellent breakfast just now with tasty bacon excellent hot home fries and solid eggs could have been a bit more moist. My waiter was great after the ice queen and definitely come back just to see if the Wednesday morning hostess has been trained that she is in the service business.
Food was great ! We went to celebrate my mothers early birthday and we all loved it ! They had a steak special that night so of course the birthday girl ordered that. Me and my little brother both had the chicken and waffles except he had his with fries.... mine was regular and both were hella tasty !! Then the pop oversssss omg we ordered one per person and ultimately had to order two additional orders!!!! Drinks were Ok of course everyone wanted to order a different cocktail but ultimately ordered the same drink, I forget the name now but it was the one with rum ! We all also ordered dessert and they were all good. No complaints here.
"So my husband and I decided to try something  new after a very long week and decided to come here, TERRIBLE MISTAKE DO NOT COMES HERE!! The waitress took about 20-30 minutes to even approach us, not sure how long because I lost track of time. She took FOREVER to take our orders and never followed up to see if we were ok. Waiting another 20-30 minutes for our food to come out, the pictures did no justice for the the way the food was presented and how it tasted First of all the ""burgers"" are rhe size of sliders, very small for $12 nothing on the side! Not worth it at all. Secondly the chicken fried pork tasted like something that I whipped  up at home in ten minutes after downing a bottle of wine to the face. I asked the waitress very politely for hot sauce and she NEVER brought it until after I was done she asked if I still wanted it...umm NO?! MY DINNER IS COLD NOW THANK YOU FOR NOTHING"
If you eat seafood you will fall in love with this place the ambiance, the food, the drinks are awesome. I can't believe it took me so long to try them out and since I did I've gone there about 4 times in the past 2 months. Remember this is a cash only establishment but it's well worth it.
Lovely dinner last night with friends, everyone was happy with their food choices.  Very competent service, taking off one star for the noise, we had to yell across the table to be heard.
This restaurant had great reviews that seemed really promising, but all the food was disappointing. We got queso for the table, which was just a pile of semi-melted cheese and definitely not worth $11. The flautas were not very crispy and the cheese inside was not melted. The chips were very greasy and not crispy. The server was rude and judgmental. I would not come back here.
Service is not up to par! Waited over 1hour for a table when they said it would be 30mins... When we got seated the table was for 6 when we had 10. Do Not order the sweet potatoe fries! Its $15 for shredded fried potatoe with a layer of sugar on top... Thats not sweet potatoe fries!
Horrible pizza paired with horrible service. If you call the store, expect to be hung up on.  Think greasy mediocre slices with poorly assembled toppings.  Think filthy tables and floors.  Think large, rude men covered in pizza grease.  The only thing they have going for them is the insane hours they are open until, so they really adhere to the drunk crowd. Sadly, they can't keep up with the people who live and work in the neighborhood or surrounding neighborhoods who aren't blackout drunk.
Loved the delicious, colorful and well portioned meals. The lunch special is a fantastic deal. Friendly and efficient staff make it a must. Also, there plenty of options for vegans.
Great place for dinner in DUMBO! After making a reservations we were seating right away once arriving.  We ordered mussels as an appetizers that were great, they came in a creamy white sauce that was good enough to lick out of the bowl! We also ordered the lobster pasta that was filling and tasty.  It was a great place for a date night and would return! Next time may plan to come for $1 oysters at the bar!
We finished our last night in New York at Suspenders.  Ideally located in walking distance to the 9/11 Memorial.  The Shepherd's Pie was real good.  Fair prices.  Can't beat it in the area.
Applewood smoked, then seared duck breast. Best duck breast I've ever had, PERIOD!! I'm not sure what the culinary equivalent of a mic drop is, but the chef that came up with this dish deserves to bust out every time this dish is served.
We were promptly sat at 7pm and the process of ordering took quite a while.  By 7:20 we had ordered drinks and our food.  It was pretty warm inside the new restaurant and warm outside for October so it wasn't a comfortable temperature.  The bread was bland (could've bought it anywhere) but the herbs and spices were blended well and tasted good with the olive oil.  The five of us had our dishes come individually.  Around 8:00 came the first two dishes. A while passed while three people sat without food and they came back to tell us (a lie) that our stuffed shells just went in to the oven.  8:30 came another, 8:45 a non-stuffed shell dish came and finally the last dish came at 9.  The manager/owner brought it to us and said they were out of stuffed shells at this point but that he would offer the gnocchi (which cost less).  The person most hungry, unfortunately, was the last one to eat.  She had originally (at 7:20) ordered a dish that was already 86ed for the night so the stuffed shells were the only other thing quasi appetizing to her. Then she gets the gnocchi instead.  Not good reviews of the puttanesca but then gnocchi was acceptable.  But cheese makes everything better, right?  Drinks were good but overpriced. The manager offered a round of drinks for our troubles but we had to request that one order of the stuffed shells be taken off the bill (duh).  I mean, you don't open a restaurant on Thur-Sun.  Everyone knows that. We wanted to be supportive but come on, folks.  We saw neighbors come in, sit for 30 min, and leave without ordering.  Unacceptable.  You're in NY. Get it together.
Despite attentive service and an amazing view, the food was meh and overpriced for what it was.   We had the salmon and the chicken salad.  I think my favorite part of the meal was the cranberry bread and butter they bring prior to your main course and the ambience.   It was fun to experience, but I don't think we'll be back soon.
"This is one of those places in New York that feels like a fantasy. When I was walking over, I was thinking, I am not even that hungry hope I can get something small??? Well that all changed, when I walked in, I was smacked with the strongest scent of butter and garlic, I am fairly sure my hair even smelled of the delicious scents. I met one of my girlfriend's and her son, she had gloves on and was shelling his crab into a bucket and mixing it with clams and rice in a bowl for him. Now that I was officially starving and staring at his food, thinking would it be wrong of me to try his. I swear NY has removed all social decency from my natural being. I thought it's time to get serious. I ordered the crab cake which was ALL crab and steamed clams in the spicy garlic butter sauce and it changed my life. My gf ordered the chicken wings as she doesn't like seafood, ""lift jaw from table"", and also the Brussels sprouts. They deep fry them, sauce them with Thai basil and fish sauce. Again this meal has changed my life! Cannot wait to go back :)"
I don't even know where to start. Me and my bestfriend came here for my birthday brunch and the service today was horrible. First, we approached the front hostess who's name is Alissa and she was EXTREMELY rude might I add) and we asked to be seated for 2 people, she informed us that the kitchen was ...closed? nowhere does it state that they close from 3:30-6 .... brunch is over at 4 I believe and they open again 2 and half hours later! So by default we had to wait longer than we expected. Okay, no problem, so we sat at the bar until they reopened. We specifically asked the hostess Alissa if we needed to give a name so at least we would be called as soon as they were ready, she assured us it was not necessary. As 6 o'clock approached we seen the front of the restaurant getting crowded with people waiting, not thinking much of it, we assumed we had already checked in at the front verbally at least since we know she never wrote our name down. Anyway, long story short she seats everyone that JUST came in before even approaching us to ask if we were ready to be seated. I also heard another group of girls saying how the Hostess Alissa was rude so we shared stories. After approaching her and ASKING to be seated AGAIN she rolled her eyes and placed the menus at the table and pointed to where we would be sitting (didn't even walk us to the table like she did everyone else) by this time I was so bothered I asked to speak to the manager who is a bald light complexion man who after being told I asked for him specifically, took an hour to approach my table as I watched him ignore the waiter. I think he even got upset at the waiter who told him I asked for him because I later seen him apologizing. After he approached me so long after I asked to speak with him I just told him forget it. So here I am. A long time customer, GONE. Real Management and hospitality in this place is nonexistent.
My friends and I have been drinking craft beer for a little over 6 years now and it is an ever changing and rapidly growing trade. Small breweries all over NY and the US are creating insane IPAs, Sours, stouts, pale ales etc and bonds are forming over amazing 5-10% beers. Craft Culture is changing the way hop lovers enjoy delicious beverages. I believe they will become an ever changing staple for local and traveling craft beer drinkers. Their concept of being one stop shop for all local NY breweries is fantastic. I'm not saying the days of standing in line for cans in the freezing or sweltering weather are long gone, but it's wonderful to have a centralized place to come too, and enjoy the ever changing beer selections. It's also great to be able to sit and grab a bite to eat. I look forward to seeing the impact Craft Culture has on queens and it's beer loving patrons.
Gloriously amazing dishes for brunch! We came by here for brunch at about 3pm (still serving). We got sat down quickly and was treated nicely. I ordered the pull pork benedict which I have been craving for a while. My first time here btw. The pull pork benedict was delicious in every way. The pork wasn't overly salty as the way i like it ans it was soft ans chewy. My husband ordered the burger which was extremely juicy and flavorable. Nice fries and their sauce compliment well with the food. Definitly coming back for more to try and highly recommended.   Atmosphere was relaxing, chilling, and comfortable.
I love their bar. It's a perfect joint for some drinks after work with friends. We were only there for beers but I've had great reviews on their cocktails as well. They have two kinds of seatings - bar and normal. It wasn't hard to find a place on a Friday night at the bar - the service is great! Definitely doing an office event there!
Good place for Malaysian food and Thai food! The price is acceptable for one main course plus an appetizer.
Oysters and lobster cocktail are fresh and tasty. The entree is ok and very mediocre. The atmosphere is loud and very noisy and hard to have conversations. The service is good.
Pretty basic soul food. I had something like honey fried chicken. It was pretty bland from what I remember. There was no seasoning. I also thought the portion was small, it was literally a chicken quarter.  The hospitality here is really nice though. Everyone was very sweet. The mac and cheese and collard greens were good though. Also the free cornbread was great. It was a pretty standard place in regards to soul food. I'll probably be back and try some other stuff on their menu.
This is an excellent rustic restaurant!! Went for brunch and I ended up having the chicken and waffles and they were beyond excellent, the chicken was so well flavored and moist. The skin was super crispy. I would advise anyone to go and try. This is a lower east side jewel
Came here to kill some time and had a great experience. I got the beef burger and it was unbelievable. Also make a great old fashion if you're into that.  If it's a nice day, they'll typically have the doors open. So even though you're inside, you have a nice breeze of fresh (NY) air coming in.  Overall- great atmosphere and food/drink
"I can't believe I never wrote a review for Woorijip... aka the ""drunken"" hangout after say 2AM...  No fuss, no thrills... not fancy, just Korean quick eats... and me & my friends used to looooove eating here: cheap, good food and soju.... but that all changed pretty quickly.  Don't get me wrong, Woorijip was a consistent hangout place... for the last 15 years.  After Reno, new layout, came with new price$$!  My favs included kimbaps, cold sprout salad, beef bulgogi, jeons, japchae and seasonal fishes.  Their package lunch boxes were also decent.   Now in 2017... a little wiser... should know better.  Couldn't help myself - went in for a quick bite.  Their food turned to sh*t quality, prices went 20% higher and I don't see how anyone would pay $12-13 for a crappy lunch box!?!  There's just better food than here... the dang food court has a better food game!  #goodbye20s #done"
Despite the dollar rating on Yelp, this is not a substantially cheaper or better than the other bars in the area. Our first set of drinks (a smoky whiskey drink - the working class hero, I think - and a slightly spicy tequila drink with hell in the name) were pretty good, although the tequila drink would have been improved by more heat. My second cocktail (a Willy Wonka) was a disappointment - it tasted more like a shot than a cocktail and none of the dessert flavors really came through. On the food front, the pork belly tostada was fantastic. The New York fries (poutine) were fine but unexceptional - the fries were crispy but the gravy flavor didn't work with the type of cheese and it never really came together as a dish. It gets busy and can get quite loud. At this price point, I can't help but think there are probably better options nearby, since nothing here wow'd me.
Came here for lunch with my husband and had the most enjoyable meal. I ordered the uni bibimbap and it was so good I'm still thinking about it. The reason I'm only giving the place 4 stars is my husband did not like his order as much as I loved mines. He had the noodle soup & said the ones from k-town are much better. The decor is really nice & service was great. The host & waiter was really friendly and the owner ( at least I think he was) asked us if we were enjoying the meal. Would definitely come back and try the other things on the menu or just order the uni bibimbap again.
Asian FUSION -- but not the typical Asian + some other random type of food (usually Mexican).. more like Asian 1 + Asian 2.  Asian food is all the same! SAID NO ONE EVER.  I was blown away by the Thai/Viet?/Filipino dishes here. Literally everything we ate was delicious and packed with flavor.  The 3 of us got three small plates and two bowls of coco rice. Way more than enough to share especially because the rice is filling. -pork belly adobo: one of my favorite filipino dishes! Sauce tasted just like home, and the pork belly they use is a little crisp on the outside, pretty fatty, and very tender. Kind of like the pork slices you get in pork buns. Also comes with a soft boiled egg -sizzling sisig: pork head served on a sizzling plate with egg on top and you mix it all together to finish the cooking process! more gingery in flavor than I like, but still good to try -khao soi: milky coconut red curry with tender and moist pieces of chicken, all on a bed of egg noodles! I think my favorite dish of the night. I love coconut based curry, so this hit the perfect spot -coconut rice: slight stickiness to it, but not enough to be dessert-like. The rice went great with ALL the dishes!! and the bowls are fillllled. We probably could have just shared one bowl between the 3 of us. Can't wait to try their brunch menu!
Solid lobster roll with good portion sizes. The lobster was a bit on the blander side and I wish they have given more lemon or sriracha or butter. But overall a really good meal and the chips were delicious! Love that they have pitchers of iced tea showing this place is ideal for groups. Hope to check out the backyard at some point, seems ideal for a weekend afternoon. The menu is huge and I'm excited to come back and try out some of the other entrees, including the crab cakes.
I had the lobster sandwich, to go.  Lobster meat was hard, not as tender as I've had at other places.  It was spicy too!  Not my taste when lobster is spiced up, which covers up its original lobster flavor.  The bread was extremely hard, not sure if it's old or over toasted.  The salad that came with it had rotten lettuce leaves, the rest was just soggy and oily.  I was just dissatisfied with the whole thing in the box, then I saw the receipt, Wow!  $33 for this below average, small lobster sandwich that is hard to chew, covered up in spicy sauce.  I could get 2 lobster rolls from Luke's lobster that tastes much better and tender and fresher.
"The only reason this got a star is because of the great space this horrible restaurant is situated in. Just kidding! It's because yelp won't let me give it NO STARS! But really, the decor and space itself beg the question ""why does this place suck so much?"" Saying the food is overpriced is a gross understatement. THIS IS THE WORST MEAL I've had in NYC... Literally. Price aside, the food was just awful. When I think about how much I paid it makes me want to track down the owner and ask for a refund! The employees, or ""customer service"" robots, that buzz around trying to do something useful need a lesson in not overdoing it. Someone comes to refill my water and before I have a sip another drone fills it up with more!  LIST OF WHAT I HAD AND HOW BAD IT WAS ON A SCALE OF 1-10: 10 being the BEST, 1 being the WORST... seared lamb skewer -2    fried calimari-1 blue moon draft beer-10    marinated salmon-1  chicken frittes-2  organic chicken skewer-NEGATIVE 7 bomba meatball-1 mashed potatoes-5    DO NOT EAT HERE. MAYBE CHECK IT OUT FOR A DRINK."
This restaurant has the most unique dishes it's simply Asian cuisine but prepared so deliciously. We have the curry noodles, fish, pork skin, coconut and Jasmine rice (to name a few) and we finished all the dishes.  As for the ambience I felt that they could have added additional restroom stalls and the music could have been more children friendly. I'm giving this a four stars because the food was delicious the staff was super friendly and I will recommend this to all my friends and family.
Avoid. The food has gone downhill and the staff is nice but simply not attentive (e.g., forgetting dishes we ordered, dirt and dust falling into our food).
Pretty solid spot! A lot of train stations nearby but it was a significantly long walk from Rockefeller Center. From the outside, the place looks smaller than I expected but there is actually 2 floors inside. Making reservations here was really easy and being the late person that I am (sorry!), they were very cooperative and helped push back our reservation for a party of 7.  Drinks were awesome! I got the Cucumber Batida and it was refreshing. My friend got the Flunk Flink and it had a sweet coconut-y taste. We also shared some appetizers but they weren't that memorable. The calamari could've had more flavor, the papaya salad is pretty sour so if you're into that, it might be good for you. Spring rolls were nothing special either. However, I got the Kui Teaw Laksa and it was definitely the best part of the meal. Pork belly in it was a little dry, but decent amount of shrimp and PERFECT coconut curry. I should've brought it home just so I can reuse the broth to make noodles in!
"I've been avoiding this place cause I didn't believe the hype that a chain restaurant would be ""that"" good. Especially for an Italian joint in NY, since family owned Italian restaurants are on every block. Anyway, my friends and I just popped in for dessert and it was great! Way more than I expected. It's a grocery store plus food court. They have a lot of imported Italian goods and produce to sell. I looked over at a few people's entrees and they looked pretty good.  I got a hazelnut-chocolate mousse dessert and it was like Nutella on crack. So so so good! I highly recommend it for anyone who loves Nutella. I also got to try some of my friend's gelato and pretty amazing as well. Prices are a little steep so I wouldn't be a regular. The vibes were pretty chaotic. We had to fight for seats and had people hovering over us while we were eating. It was kind of expected though.  TLDR - The hype is real. Whether it's dinner, dessert, or groceries, this place has it all."
Went here with a friend to grab a bite to eat for dinner on a Thursday night. A little to my surprise, it was actually not very crowded and we were able to get a table right away. After perusing the menu, I decided to go with the burger. A lot of the menu seems tasty, but I was really feeling like having a burger and it's pretty much the only item under $23 on the menu. The burger itself was decent--nothing to write home about and a bit overcooked, but not terrible. A bit more than I would have paid for it somewhere else, but I guess you pay for the space and ambiance as well. Overall, the service was friendly and the food came out within a reasonable amount of time, but if you're going to drop nearly $20 for a burger, you might be happier somewhere else.
I got the chance to try this popular Thai spot on a Monday for lunch. We got to try out the lunch special where you choose from 3 different categories: appetizer, soup, entree, and  beverage for a set price of $14.95.  We started off with the chicken & shrimp dumpling and the papaya salad. The dumplings were a little below average. It had a funny texture to it. The papaya salad was pretty refreshing but got a little too spicy for my taste.  For the soup, I got to try the cocounut chicken soup & the Tom Yum shrimp soup. Both were amazing. You could really taste the coconut and the curry in the soup. It blended pretty well together. The tom yum soup was also very good. The soup came with two shrimps in it.  Our main entree was the Red Curry with Rice & the drunken noodle with chicken. Both were excellent and very tasty. The noodles were cooked pretty well, which could make it or break with this dish. The red curry was delicious, especially with the bamboo and the chicken in it. Overall, fast service, great food, and excellent price for lunch. Highly recommended spot.
"Note: I called two hours prior to walking in, only to be told they don't take brunch reservations. We were seated at the bar by the window and told the tables behind us were reserved. LOL WHAT?!? Didn't the guy on the phone two hours ago tell me they don't take brunch reservations? That's why I came in an hour before my friends arrived to put my name down. Ok, fine. Knock one star down. (Oh and if you're gonna tell me it was a 4-top table so they can't seat three people, the people that seated who apparently ""reserved"" a table was a 3 party ""reservation."" )  I'm still bitter.  Service is crap.(Minus the female host.)  Onto the food.   Between the three of us, we shared Crispy Fried Bucket of Bird (Half Bird) $19, Buckwheat Cheddar Waffle $7 * (7 if ordered with chicken 8 as a side without chicken), Biscuits N Gravy $12, Bonuts $9, Macaroni & Cheese $9.  So allegedly the fried chicken here is SOOOO good. I had high expectations walking in and left feeling whatever. The chicken wasn't melt in your mouth worthy, nor was it finger lickin' good. In fact, one drumstick looked like it was OVER deep fried or just plain out OLD and REFRIED! The chicken was so dry and inedible, I took one bite. (Refer to photo.)  The Buckwheat Cheddar Waffle was too thick for my liking but at least it wasn't dry! And my friend seemed to kinda like it?  Biscuits and Gravy were pretty solid. The only dish all my friends agreed was TOO good!  Bonuts should not be a thing outside this restaurant because it's a heart attack and then some. Fried biscuit covered in sugar. IT LIVES. WAS IT GOOD? yeah! But was too full to even get past two bites and it's WAY too heavy for a meal like the one we devoured.  Overall not terrible yet not great. I wouldn't believe this to be the best for fried chicken. (Or service.)  Look elsewhere for a bomb fried chicken meal."
I wish I could rate this market properly but it was closed suddenly upon my arrival today without much forewarning. They only tweeted 2 hours in advance about the closure. So a 1.5 hour commute from the Bronx all for naught. Please let your customers know a day in advance of closures in the future! That left me with no time to find an alternative for dinner before our show. Especially since you're located so far out of the way! :(
Decided to try this today since it's Restaurant Week. For a party of 4 we only had 2 prix fixe and ordered the remainder from the regular menu. The Fluke was blah, for want of a better word. The kale, even it was not physically appealing, tasted really god. We mixed the two and it actually worked very well. Second course was a salmon dish, soft and buttery, and a pasta dish, drowning in olive oil. The other 2 dishes were a turkey sandwich, which was really good and a mushroom pizza, very nice as well. The deserts were good, but IMHO these dishes were not James Beard worthy. The service was extremely slow, we spent 2.5 hours just completing our meal
"Devilled eggs filled with egg shells. ""Crunch crunch crunch"" was all i could feel as i took a bite. Egg shell spoils the appetite so I couldn't eat after that. When I told the waiter that there were eggshells in the deviled eggs, he stared at me for a good 5 seconds then said ""so do you still want them?"" As if it was normal for them to have eggshells in them, I had to actually instruct him to take them back. And by the end of the night the fcker still charges me for the deviled eggs. Drinks were shite too. A lot of processed bottled cocktail mixes. NEVER come here. Go to Blue Smoke."
The scene was nice and the restaurant had a four star review so we decided to try. Our waiter was not polite and didn't seem to know much about the menu...didn't know how many wings came with the wing order.  Drinks were sub-par. Food was good but I wouldn't say great. Very expensive for a Tavern. I would say better for lunch than dinner.
Seeing this place on tv I had to try. Unfortunately this place does not stand up to the hype. Very expensive for the portion size. Living in NYC we have access to much better Italian options. Will not go back.
"I really, really don't want to write a bad review. As you can see more or less my reviews are all positive so when I have a poor experience, I really need to let it be known. I also wanted to provide some constructive feedback to the manager to help them with their new business but they failed to ask how everything was going. So, here it is on Yelp.  The food was excellent; back of the house is on point. However, why the low stars?It's because the front of the house needs a lot of work. To me food is everything but when the service is not what you expect at a ""$$$"" restaurant, then your overall experience is ruined.  My suggestions to management:  1) Provide a mandatory tasting of all your dishes to your servers/front of the house team. They MUST know what dishes they are selling. How can you run a restaurant when the server doesn't know if ""chips"" come with the fish and chips? They must know the drink and food menu inside and out. What if someone has an allergy?  2) For a restaurant that charges $25+ per entree, I do expect the servers to know who ordered what-no questions. This is NOT Applebee's. The ambiance and food are great, but training your staff and having them on the same level as management with communication and training should come FIRST.  3) The dessert came and we still had dirty food, forks and knives from our entree on our table. Please take them away and wipe down our table before dessert is served. Again, it's the price point that sets the tone.  4) We had THREE people come to tell us they were out of the dessert we wanted to order. Please communicate with each other or have only 1-2designated servers. 5) It should be mandatory to bring out coffee with cream (or whatever you request as a creamer) plus sugar. Don't just bring the cream without sugar. We shouldn't have to ask. Oh, and also please check if there's mugs to fill at the table before coming with the coffee. Better yet, for a more lux experience, please pour the coffee behind the bar and then bring it to us.  6) Our five servers were nice (like everyone served us) and we're trying their best, so kudos to them. But negative points to management for not training your staff properly! It all begins with you and the communication you have with your team. If they are trained on the food, best practices on serving, then you will see the $$ roll in. I also recommend the manager coming by each table to ask how everything is.  This may sound like a petty review but if I'm paying $25+ for an entree (just as an example) I better get the service that comes along with it. Make sure management is on the same page as the servers, and vice versa. Teamwork is everything."
I came here on a Sunday night and we were seated right away. This place has dive bar kind of feel and it's super casual. We were able to seat ourselves and pick the music from the jukebox (it already had money). The waiters were very attentive and friendly. Great service! Now for the food we ordered a dozen oysters ($1 each) and the crispy fried rice with shrimp. We also had 2 brooklyn lagers ($6 each). The oysters weren't that fresh. They were very generous by giving us 14 per order instead of 12 pieces. And while $12 seem like a great deal, I wouldn't reccomend them. They weren't clean and tasted a bit bland in my opinion. The crispy fried rice was delicious. It tasted like sesame oil which I love hahaha. The texture was very crispy similar to what you get from rice that's been sitting on the bottom of a hot stone pot.  I had a great time and would definetly stop by again.
They serve food really quick- less than 5 minutes. The curry tastes like it has vinegar inside. Waiters are friendly. $10 credit card minimum.
"We went here for brunch sunday afternoon. Two fritattas, both bland and greasy, one better looking than the other. A plate of farro, also bland but with a large hen of the woods mushroom thrown in. Overall uninteresting, average menu and average food. The service was bored and disinterested, at times ""I dont get paid enough"" rude. If you have a chance check out other places nearby. The only thing likable here were the choice of cotton stems in the flowers."
I live in Battery Park City and have numerous, excellent restaurant choices in the area.  However, my goto bar and grill is Suspenders (the old location, and now the new bar on Rector).  The new location is perfectly situated near Wall St, the Freedom Tower, subways, etc.  The food is amazing, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  The barstaff are extremely friendly, and service is ALWAYS quick!  Take it from a VERY picky eater, Suspenders is awesome!
Really unhappy with Bedouin Tent right now. I'm a loyal customer and come all the time for lunch. They have delicious food and lovely pita bread. I came in on a Thursday afternoon and had just eaten somewhere else but wanted my parents who were visiting from out of town to try their pita bread. They REFUSED to sell me just a pita, insisting I must buy a salad or soup with it. I offered them $3 for just the pita to which they said no. I'm sorry that's ridiculous. The salads start at $5.25 which I'm sorry I'm not paying that for just the pita. Bothersome because I'm raving about how lovely this place is and then they REFUSE to sell me just a pita bread. Poor customer service.
I'm a big fan of tapas and Japanese food so this place seemed perfect for me, the impressive sake selection and the numerous meat options got me pumped for an evening here! We were sat 30 minutes after our reservation time and it took our server way too long to greet us initially.There were 4 of us and we ordered at least a dozen dishes, sake flight and glasses of sake. Sake was good, I was not impressed with the food however. Most of the plates were underwhelming especially for the price. They were good but not 26$ a small plate good. I was expecting much more flavor for that much. The highlight of the night was definitely the black sesame creme brûlée, definitely amazing and unique. I may return for sake flights and desert but it wasn't good enough for me to return for a full blown dinner.
Beware, they charge you for tips without letting you know, with the excuse that the bill is higher than one hundred dollars. Not happy with the service.
Very surprised to see such high ratings for this restaurant. A 2.5 seems like a fair rating based on my experience. I really wasn't impressed by the food. The calamari came out chewy. The sauce for the ravioli almost tasted canned. The bread was really good. The service was good. I went during lunch so maybe they were having some off hours... I would try somewhere else next time. The interior need an update. It seemed cheep and felt depressing. I was visiting NYC from Philly and the overall experience and quality of food was a huge disappointment. It was so bad it was actually comical and good to look back and laugh at. Not quite what I was going for.
I found two pieces of bone in my pork bun and the bun itself was hard and slightly stale. The sliders are still awesome.
Drinks are good, food could use some work. Came in for lunch on a Tuesday during restaurant week. It was about 1:30pm, so the wait staff was very attentive (even more when I was about to tip/sign the check - no need to overdue it, folks. feels awkward ) For my eats, I chose.. Calamari salad- a very generous sized appetizer. Chef was too generous with the dressing/sauce tho- so my greens were a bit oily,  but the flavors were good. Crusted Flounder- light and pleasant, good flavors. Creme Brulee- Eeek! A major fail, unfortunately. They offer a trio of flavors: Red Bean, Classic, Green Tea. They were all served ice cold (CB should be cold and creamy with the top crispy and hot). The creme was badly curdled and I couldve seriously done without the Green Tea option. Highlight: The Peach Sangria- very refreshing! Prob won't return- nothing really stood out.  ...
The lobster roll was really good but their mac n cheese appetizer was fantastic. The menu was impressive and I will definitely be back for lunch again.
When you're in the mood for some bougie Asian food, Buddakan is a gorgeous spot to dine at on a date, with friends, or even with family. Their cocktails are deliciously indulgent - don't be afraid to ask your host or hostess for a recommendation. Table Favorites: Edamame Dumplings, Peking Duck Salad, Sizzling Short Rib, Spiced Eggplant and Tofu Least Loved Dish: Dungeness Sticky Rice - missing the dungeness and the sticky! Favorite Desserts: Chocolate Pistachio Cremoso, Coconut Ice Cream Everything else was pretty good, but not mind blowing: Oxtail Dumplings, Tea Smoked Spare Ribs, Foie Gras and Chicken Dumplings, Black Pepper Beef, Glazed Alaskan Black Cod, Crying Chocolate, Almond Bread Pudding Enjoy!
Had the avocado toast with poached eggs which looked delicious in the photos but not so yummy in real life because the lack of seasoning on the avocado. Portion could have been bigger too. The pastrami hash was also not very good, a little too salty imo. Coffee was watery. Couldn't even get coffee right. The ladies next to me got the fried chicken&waffles and pancakes which looked promising. I might give this place another try if there's no wait and I'm around the area.
"So much has changed. Literally. I used to frequent this cart every Friday night back in college and also after a long night of partying in the city (the old days, hehe). So sad to see how prices have gone up and quality of food as declined. The chicken over rice platter, so very delicious-at one point. But it's the white sauce which makes the food what it is. And you can pour that white sauce on any other halal cart platter and it will taste just as good. Reason for my 1 star and why I won't be buying ""Gyro"" from these guys anymore, simple...don't treat your loyal customers like shit. If someone who is traveling all the way from a different borough just to get your food is requesting ""extra"" white sauce and hot sauce, you don't give an attitude or charge them extra. That is ridiculous. If it wasn't for your loyal customers you wouldn't even be in business. I'm sure it does not hurt your pockets to give away an extra packet of your white sauce and hot sauce full of artificial flavours. After all, havent you guys made enough money that you were able to open up little restaurants all over the country/world?! But being so money hungry you still hike up the prices on your food. How dare you complain or over charge when a customer is asking if they can have extra sauce please! Absolutely embarrassing for you as a business and unacceptable. Never again! You can keep your boiled flavorless chicken that only has any taste if drenched in white sauce."
Excellent food! Bacon and brisket was top notch. Beans were just ok, but overall fantastic meal.
Incredibly rude staff. I called ahead to make a reservation and was hung up on 3 times after being told to check their website for hours of operation. I had no service and was told I must be the only person in new york without Internet instead of them just telling me when they were open. Good to know that this restaurant refuses to accommodate people if they can't get online when they could just choose to be helpful.
It's a good spot to catch up with friends and grab a drink. We sat in the back, which was nice because it was quiet enough to hold a conversation. The wait staff seemed slightly confused about the beer menu at times and weren't super on the ball about making recommendations. The calamari is decent and the hummus plate is kinda meh (hummus seemed rather flavorless and dry) and was way over priced. Would come back for the beer.
Their food is solid, cocktails are great and beer selection is light but well curated. Definitely recommend and coming back.
Great Hole in the Wall for Ramen in NYC fidi. Ordered Shoyu pork, Miso Pork Ramen and Tonkostu.  Food was great and hit the spot. Came after 1:30pm and there where plenty of seats available. Lunch runs around $10-14.
**UPDATED**  The menu is no longer your simple three option of burger, lobster roll, lobster. New menu consists of different types of burgers and lobster rolls with various toppings! A little harder on the brain, but better for your tummy :) My fav is still the original burger and the original lobster roll. Burger portion is out of control. Patty is very juicy, accompanied with bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomato etc. Lobster roll is one of the best in NYC. Even though it is a cold style roll, the mayo doesn't overpower the lobster meat. Love the crispy toasted bun.
Cute neighborhood italian spot with delicious food and great ambiance.  Ordered ravioli in creamy wild mushroom sauce. The dish comes with lots of mushrooms :) This place is usually very packed so make sure you rsvp or expect a  long wait.
So happy that the new Los Tacos No 1 is finally open in Times Square! The tacos are definitely worth braving the crowds of tourists nearby to get some quality tacos. There are four main options for tacos. The carne asada and chicken are both great, and the nopal (cactus) is something you don't find at most taco places in this area. But the adobada is my favorite. Sliced right off the spit and topped with pineapple, it's delicious. They also have quesadillas and mulas with the same toppings. There are a bunch of standing areas where you can eat all your taco treats, and it seems like more space than the one in Chelsea. Will definitely be back for more tacos!
I gave a 3 stars because the ambiance averaged out the disappointment with the meal. I had heard so much about this place, but wasn't so impressed-- the mushroom crostini was decent but a bit salty. The skate was very bland and the dessert- apricot cheesecake was just off. The waiter did recommend a great red wine, which made the experience much better. Overall, great ambiance and I would go back for drinks, but was disappointed about the food.
Overall 3.5. Not sure if it was totally worth the hype. Perhaps dinner options are better. We wanted lunch so we stumbled upon this. Note their brunch/lunch service closes at 3pm.   The good: - Service was wonderful. The guys were helpful and attentive.  - the truffle mac and cheese with the clams was amazing. I rarely like mac and cheese so it is saying something that I actually liked it.  - the plantain dish was very tasty but small for the price. The meh: -The lychee adult Caprisun drink wasn't impressive as it appeared. It is just the novelty of it. Maybe I would liked it with some grass jelly. -the popcorn chicken was okay. It was too much of a chore to finish for 2 people.
"Come here if you want a great burger and horrible service. The blonde server who ""lived in France for 2 years"" literally chased us down the sidewalk because we accidentally tipped her less than 20% (we left 15% due to an error on our part splitting the check between 2 cards and cash). Long story short, she walked away with over 30% due to her abrasiveness. Good for her, bad for this business."
"I went there on a last Saturday for early dinner at 5:30pm with my husband and daughter. I went there intentionally for the fresh sea urchin and fish (according the reviews and pictures). I ask for live sea urchin and Waygu beef, and the waitress said sold out due to the good business a night before and 4 items on the menu not available.   While I was eating I saw the chef showing to his friends a live unni, and I ask the waitress why can they have a unni and is supposedly ""sold out,""...waitress response : ""The customer is best friend w/ the chef and get special treatment."" First time in my life I saw and heard this! 1. New business, why don't you order more fish, and beef!!  2. Not going again to a Cantonese own sushi restaurant with bad service and lack of items in the small menu.  3. The roll we order was very small, & fish was fresh. I had better ones in Queens. My daughter had ramen with Chinese bbq pork (char siu) thinly slice...Cantonese char siu in a Japanese restaurant! Not professional!  4. Not going again!"
Service was over all good. We got complimentary Thai teas with check in ! The food was pretty yum, but I've been fortunate enough to never have bad Thai food, so I can't really compare it to anything else. It wasn't anything special, but also nothing bad.  I get the same thing I always get; call me a creature of habit. Drunken noodles with chicken ! The spice and seasoning were pretty delish.  However I can't give them 5 stars because I was a little turned off about how persistent the owner was to get me and my boyfriend to write a Yelp review. I just wanted to enjoy dinner with him... I totally understand entrepreneurship and wanting reviews, but talking to us throughout our whole dinner just isn't the way.  I'd say maybe next time take out would be a better option, or maybe don't act like a first timer, so we don't get bothered to write reviews.
Queens is having a moment & it's hard not to like a spot with this name. Super corner location an 8 minute walk from 71st St with cute kitschy touches, decor is on point. Friendly service and an extensive menu. Ate: Bully salad Smoked half chicken with cornbread slaw and rustic veggies Total: $28 The salad was the best dish of the meal, big, tangy with tomato slivers. The chicken was slathered with sticky sweet sauce which I had to wipe off before eating the no-name chicken. The cole slaw and corn bread were good, but the veggies were far from rustic rather a melange of frozen tasteless veggies in a mystery brown sauce- inedible. There is promise here, but foodwise, but it's not creative or cutting edge culinarily speaking, the two spots in Astoria like Butcher Bar and my favorite Salt and Bone make the Queens food cut! I realize that I was overcharged by $5- my bill should have been $22 plus tax!, I guess they are borough bullies!
I'd give Fort Defiance four stars just because they have the best Irish coffee I've ever had in my life, but their food is mostly just okay.  The biscuits are pretty good, fluffy, large, warm and savory, but most of the other brunch items are only average. I've been there probably thirty times and had most of them, but usually I get the veggie scramble, and I'm never that enthused about the food.   My wife often gets the egg sandwich and feels the same. Not bad, just average, but again the Irish coffee keeps us coming back even if it's a bit steep at $10. I haven't been for dinner, so maybe they rebound in the evenings?
"I'm a huge fan of Uva! I came here for the first time with some girlfriends while in town for a bachelorette weekend. It is a small, intimate restaurant that I'd love to visit again with my boyfriend and perhaps for brunch, as my first and only visit was for dinner. We had a reservation for 8:30 on a Friday, and I was a bit nervous when we were running late and I had to call to see if our reservation could be changed to 9. They were able to accommodate us, though, and we only had to wait a minute or two for our table to be ready once we got there. I would in no way use the word ""friendly"" to describe the gentleman that I spoke to or the lady at the hostess stand, but they were not rude either. I will say, however, that our server was excellent. He was very helpful with recommendations and was able to answer any questions about the menu! We ordered a couple of bottles of Lambrusco and some dishes to start. The bruschetta and calamari were good, but the prosciutto and mozzarella were favorites among the group. If I were to go back, I'd stick to the meats and cheese as the options were so extensive! The main dishes were all excellent. We all stuck to the pasta, and none of us were disappointed! We all especially loved the gnocchi, though. We also shared two desserts, one being tiramisu and the other a Nutella creation served with ice cream. I swear, I'd go back for the Nutella dessert alone!! It was delicious and paired well with our espresso and cappuccino. All in all, the atmosphere was beautiful, the food was great, and the service was pretty good! I can't wait to check it out again and explore other items on the menu."
I'm sorry to say I was a little disappointed in this place. I was rooting for a great BBQ place uptown! Our server was nice and pretty attentive. However, they were out of a few of the sides including the fufu pretty early in the night. I ended up ordering the mac and cheese to go with my brisket. It tasted like plain bechamel sauce on the mac and cheese, not cheesy at all. The brisket was rather tough and not that well seasoned. Bacon was alright though the texture of it was kind of like jerky. At least there was a decent beer selection and the rusty jalepeno cocktail was pretty good. Food was disappointing.
Chicken is super salty!!! Like after a few bites it dries out your mouth. I ordered the chicken shwarma platter and you get two sides.  I got the Greek salad and hummus. The salad was horrible.  It was obviously just sitting for a while because it had no crunch and it was soggy. I had two bites and gave up on the salad.
Some really great food here. I took a chance and had the octopus, a dish I wouldn't normally go for, and was through pleased. Well cooked, well seasoned. Ambiance suited the restaurant. Waiting staff was helpful in making suggestions which showed that they had a good knowledge of the menu and the combinations. Overall great experience.
12 dollars for a bottle of sparking water.   bill was maybe 40% too high.  we drank during happy hour.  this place is the biggest ripoff I have ever had.  the food was maybe 3 stars at best.  you guys deserve to go out of business.   if the owner reads this fire the manager hr doesn't deserve to work.  If you are the ones setting prices.  please quit the restaurant business.  you don't deserve to make money
The guy is so rude We have a reservation and he told us to wait outside when the restaurant is so empty. He said that we cannot be seated unless we are complete. My friend and I are hungry and ready to order. Very inconsiderate!
Was not impressed when I came to here to eat. It was way over priced. The food was just okay nothing special. I probably will not be going back here.
Fantastic Thai food. Everything is good. Service is quick and efficient.
"ALERT: Prepare for major embarrassment if you bring an out-of-town guest here for brunch. Total Fail. I truly question the palate of Yelp reviewers who gave Bijan's 3 or more stars for Brunch.  It was awful.  We went with the pre-fix brunch menu and asked the server for recommendations. We ordered the two dishes that we were told were ""amazing"": The Saffron-Semolina Pancakes and the Breakfast Pizza with Eggs Sunny Side Up. I also ordered the Bijan Mary.  1) Bijan-Mary: It tasted like Campbell's tomato juice mixed with a little vodka. Completely uneventful.  2) Saffron-Semolina Pancakes: They were not bad, they were disgusting. Imagine the smell of yeast and pancake batter with a hint of saffron. They *smelled* and tasted like that. Plus they were very dry, did I mention tasteless? I do not like wasting food, so I *tried* I really did. I got 3-4 bites in. In the end, we could not stomach them.  3) Flatbread Breakfast Pizza: It was like one of those flatbread pizzas, wtih cheap ingredients that you find around Times Square. Palatable, nothing new or special. The bread was not fresh ...  it reminded me of one of those frozen flatbread pizzas from Totino's that you may have had (unfortunately) in Middle School.  Also, after asking for a glass of water 2 times, I finally received it within the last 5 minutes of the meal... But my brunch guest did not receive hers. Never again."
This place sucks. The pizza is like an expensive totinos pizza!! They are also rude and didn't even give us bread, but they gave everyone else bread. Idk if it's because we don't look Italian or because we ordered a $14 12in pizza to share. We just wanted to try pizza in little Italy and this was a horrible experience!!!!!!!
It is PACKED here at night so remember to make a reservation! We were a party of two and I had laughed at a Yelp review saying that the portions are too big for two people. We saw the menu and looked around us--yup, the portions were HUGEEEE! I honestly don't recommend coming here unless you have a group; otherwise you'd be full after several bites.  For a place this popular, I thought that the food would be amazing, but it's really not. It's GOOD and very filling, but it lacks its own twist on Italian food. I don't blame them though--after all, this place is always busy.  For two people it's kind of pricey and I wish they just had regular sized portions, but I enjoyed the experience. Definitely coming in a group next time :)
The Carrot Cake Cheesecake and our waiter, Patrick, were outstanding - five stars to each!  However, the remainder of our food was very bad and we both ended up very sick from it. We split a simple cheese burger (cooked medium - I think this was our problem) and a side of fries.
Came here on a Friday afternoon for lunch and was fortunate enough to not have a long line waiting for me. First impression was that this place is definitely a Brooklyn BBQ joint. Long picnic benches indoors with a bar on the side. They also had outdoor seating with an awning over it, great for blocking hot sunny days.  My friend and I got 4 Pork Ribs and  1/2 a lb of brisket. The meal came out to be about $50. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious and the brisket had a nice layer of fat with it. We also got sides of Guss' half-sour kosher pickles and burnt end baked beans. Both were great sides to complement the meat. Our meal automatically came with potato rolls, and nothing can really go wrong with potato bread. We were definitely full by the end of the meal.  I can see why this place would typically have a long line waiting out the door. I would have given it 5 stars for the service, food and atmosphere but unfortunately there was no serving of mac and cheese which I find to be quite vital.  Still delicious! Try and find a time to go when it's not prime dinner/weekend lunch time.
Got the Luke's trio to give each a try. Each roll was outstanding, and it was very clear that the hype was well deserved. My favorite of the three was the lobster roll, but I went back and forth before reaching that conclusion. Prices are definitely high but worth it.
Kuu is my favorite ramen in Manhattan, I ate here a few times already but I usually had different experiences.  So one time I came here at about 1 pm something and it was so crowded. All the tables were full and there was a line too. After we ordered the food, we were really worried that there was still no table at all. They made the food very fast, I was seriously imagining we would eat while standing lol But thank god 2 people finished their food and left when one of us went to the counter to get the ramen. It's lunch time so no free water too. Another time I got the tonkotsu shio salt base but it was pretty salty to me. Most of the time the food here was good,  maybe it was a bad day lol. One last thing I would talk about the pork here.  We usually get the ramen with the same type of pork so we didn't really compare. This time I got the shoyu and my friend got the sapporo one. The pork in the sapporo was char siu, they gave 2 very thin pieces while the shoyu with kakuni pork had 3 big and thick pieces. So if you are a fat ass like me, get the ramen with kakuni pork. I was more satisfied with that one.
Do you enjoy spending lots of money for very little food? Food that is decent, but not mind-blowing by any stretch? Do disembodied horse heads give you that cozy, gemütlich feeling? Well then, this is the place.  I should note that the music was good, but that's not really enough to carry an entire meal.
If you're Chinese, don't bother with this place. I grew up in San Francisco and I now live in LA. I've been to lots of excellent dim sum places and this is not one of them.  The first warning sign is the number of non-Asian customers. Someone once told me that the best Asian restaurants are filled with Asian people. This wasn't.  We ordered several dishes to try, and only one was good.  The salt and pepper fried pork chop was too salty and didn't have enough spice (other than salt). The turnip cake arrived with a layer of oil sitting on top of it as well as a puddle of oil on the plate.  Two of the Xiao long bao were touching each other in the steamer, so naturally they broke and lost their juice when I picked them up. Also, they were clearly machine made, not hand-folded. The har gow filling had an odd consistency, and they also appeared to be machine made. The bean curd dumplings were falling apart on the plate.  The only good dish was the Chinese broccoli, which is almost impossible to mess up.  My recommendation- go spend your hard-earned dollars elsewhere. Leave this place to the tourists who don't know what good dim sum tastes like.
Wanted to love this place because I heard amazing things. Unfortunately, I liked it, but not loved it. Spacious restaurant in Harlem that is clean and colorful.  Waffle and fried chicken was great! Kinda got sick of it towards the end of the dish though. We requested to get the white meat for an extra dollar. Cooked perfectly, very tender and moist! Waffle was meh, could be better. We also got the Dr. Walter Delph - fried seafood platter with 2 sides. Fried catfish was tender and not too oily. Macaroni and cheese was good, but again nothing special.  Overall, I feel like Amy Ruth's is good, but not really worth all the hype.  Service was extremely slow. It was a full house when we went, but it took 20 minutes for us to order our food.
I often played baseball at Maurice Park in Queens when I was a kid. One time, I got hit the face with a line drive. It stung. Afterwards, the coach yelled at me for catching the ball with my face instead of the glove. I felt pretty empty after that. That is how the food and price make me feel at this restaurant. The people are nice tho.
Awful. Rude staff. Called to order pick up 30 minutes before close and they claimed the kitchen is closed. Just young, obnoxious hostesses that prefer to never do any work.
Delicious Thai food, great ambiance, convenient location. This is definitely a great find- authentic food and a wide variety of Thai choices.  We came early (6-630pm) on a Saturday night and were able to be seated for 2 without a problem, though it's recommended you make reservations. The ambiance is great- different and grand without being tacky. For appetizer we had the curry puffs, a standard menu item off of their 'classics' section- they were really great. For mains we had the Hor Mok Talay- which is a fish curry (shrimp, scallops, crab and more) in a coconut shell, and the Salmon- both serves with ginger rice. They were delicious and very flavorful- and priced accordingly at $26 per dish. This is a great place to come for delicious authentic Thai food in a $$-$$$ price range.
I made plans with a friend to meet at this restaurant for arepas. It was a Tuesday at 7pm. They were CLOSED. I would like to say that this place is good, but unfortunately I'll never know. You might want to call ahead before you make any plans to eat here.
"The outdoor space - 5 Food - 3 (Smoked turkey!) Self-proclaimed ""Clean"" bathrooms - Compared to a gas station, yes, but clean overall? Not really. So - 2 Music - Generally loud and a bit 80s cheese at times - 3 Service - Food counter 5; Bar 2 So I would say 3, overall"
So I decided to give this bar a chance tonight. After I asked for a voda soda my redhead bartender forgot my fruit (lemon or lime) which is okay because I was a bartender at some point so I understand. I asked her a few times and she chose to ignore me. Then rather than bother her I grabbed one myself. She caught me, made a big scene then proceeded to talk poorly of me to the couple of girls next to me. Once again this was the red head bartender, short hair, short height and pretty sure she was the manager. Treat all your customers with respect. I regret tipping you.
I have been wanting to try this place since they first opened. I finally go in place my order. I sit and wait for my order to go, I see a guy digging in his nose. He digs with one hand and licks his finger. Then he used his other hand and started digging in his nose. Then he placed the boggers on the table. I am here thinking he was a customer, then I see him go behind the counter. The other guy who attended to me comes out with my food. I honestly was so disgusted that I grabbed my food and threw it in the garbage.
Food porn galore at Jane. We came here for dinner as my coworker's roll off dinner (although I hear this place is even more amazing for brunch). God the appetizers were SO delicious; I think we ordered 3 rounds of them, albeit we had a lot of people. I got a scallop entree which was quite tasty, but the tuna tartare, burrata, and rosemary fries really stole the show. I actually took home the leftover fries because I was talking about how much I love tasty leftover fries. I ended up eating most of it after I came back from the bars...in my bed..with the lights off, half asleep. Truly a high point in my life.
"What a joke of an establishment. The only people who eat here are transplants who think it's cool to spill their money into garbage. Absolutely a ""for the name"" place. Yelp, you usually steer me in the right direction but this time you fell flat.  Came in and sat ourselves while the staff looked at us dumb founded. Sat at a wet table because there were no other options. The hosted then met us and said oh yeah cool where ever you want. She wiped our table with paper napkins that had been left from the previous patrons. She then threw us three sticky menus, for two people. Our server who looked like he didn't wanna work here at all came over and asked us what we wanted to drink. We ordered two cocktails off their list. Waited a bit for these and they arrived. Nothing special or interesting to be said about them. They were alright.  To start we split the black salt caesar. Awful. This tasted like romaine lettuce smothered in mustard topped with too much black salt. Please, for the sake of calling your salad a caesar, LAY OFF THE MUSTARD IN THE DRESSING!!!  I then ordered the chicken parm with spaghetti special. My boyfriend ordered the  tagliatelle bolognese. My chicken parm was good. The chicken was cut this how I like, good amount of sauce, and good amount of cheese. A tiny bit salty but bearable. My boyfriend ended up eating half my chicken parm with me because the bolognese was not doing it for him. He stated there was no flavor except for a weird after taste which left it inedible.  All the while we were here, ALL of their staff was on the phone. The chef who I watched cook our meal, did so while talking on his cell phone. The hostess sat at the bar looking down at her cell phone. Our server was at his station on his phone. Jeeze people.. you're at WORK! The decor is lacking. Typical ""lets throw this place together in the cheapest way possible"" kinda joint.  I have been wanting to come here for some time now, and I am SO upset I couldnt love it."
The soup dimpling here is probably one of the best on the east coast, definitely highly recommended.  As a seafood fan, the fish was fresh and well cooked.  Shanghai noodles, which is a very common Shanghai dish is also excellent.  However, the rice noodles didn't quite meet my expectations, hence the four star rating.
The place is pretty cute, but on a fairly mild day, the interior was way too hot, since they didn't have the overhead fans on. This cute stray cat  kept us company outside. The pork belly was not tender and too salty. The western style pork shoulder was seasoned well, but also on the chewy side. The apple mustard coleslaw was inedible as it was too acidic. We ordered the garlic cheesebread as a joke, but it was good, but again too salty. It's one of those places where the description of the meals sound better than the execution. I'm all for fusion style foods, this seemed to be NC meets Vietnamese food, as there is a large Vietnamese population in Greensboro (my bf is from there and made the connection for me). I won't be going back for bbq even tho the ribs looked promising.
"I had a mixed experience at Tavern 29. I can't complain about the service downstairs. The bartender was very attentive.  When my husband and I went upstairs, a waitress greeted us in this attitude. Her exact words were ""So what will you have?""  No smile, no ""Hello, my name is _____"", just the surly attitude.  My husband wanted to switch table. After we switched, nobody came to our table. It's too bad because we were hungry and would have kept ordering more food and drinks. My husband had to go get our check. That's how much the staff ignored us. We were courteous and were not rude. Maybe we should have asked permission to move? I did not appreciate being poorly treated like that. As for the mystery waitress, she was hardly ever there or asked us how we were doing. I don't think we will be coming back."
"After countless youtube videos, and articles/blogs online, I was finally able to pay a visit here! Make sure you make a reservation way ahead of time, don't even think about getting a table here without one. Peter Luger is just on the other side of Manhatten via the williamsburg bridge. I walked across the williamsburg bridge from east village and it was about a 20 minutes walk, not too bad. We arrived early and greeted the maitre d. They usually don't let you in ahead of the time you booked the table, so just go ahead and grab a drink at the bar. The register behind the bar looks like it was from the WW2 era, pretty cool. At the bar area, you would see all the awards they received from Zagat and Michelin. Oh yea.. It's a Michelin 1 star restaurant. When you get seated, they immediately serve you a basket of bread, some butter, and their famous steak sauce. We've ordered quite a lot of food, mostly base on the suggestion I read online and watched from youtube. We ordered the following: 1) Tomato and Onion slices, even though it sounds simple, they are extremely fresh and tasty. It goes pretty well with the sauce too 2) Bacon, a must order, it was thick, juicy, tender... I like Broil meat haha 3) A bottle of Cabinet Sauvignon by Peter Luger from Napa (Waterstone Vintners), I think Peter Luger asked this winery to make this one for them. This cab is typical napa cabinet sauvignon, big and bold tannin 4) Steak for 3 people (we had 4 in our group), it was more than enough, we couldn't finish it. The steak was really well aged. We ordered it medium rare. It was served with 1 big piece of porterhouse and 1 smaller piece. Very good steak 5) German hash potato, goes very well with the steak, and steaksauce 6) Cream spinach, one of my favorite. There were very little cream. The creaminess comes from the blended spinach. Overall it was a great meal and I checked off one of the many ""must visit"" in my life. It was worth it and the price wasn't too expensive. Less than $100 per person with wine, in a world famous Michelin 1 star restaurant too!"
I really regret not being able to eat more here as I was still too full from brunch. I only had the corn and a cup of Mexican hot chocolate but it was so delicious and I've been craving it almost every day since. My friend and I came around 3:00pm, and were able to grab a seat right away. The staff were all really friendly and the food came out pretty quickly. They even give you wet naps for the corn. I'll definitely try to come back the next time I'm in town, since the reviews on the other menu items seem to be great as well.  -Side note: the restroom is SUPER cramped; your face will be centimeters from the door while you're on the toilet lol. Actually, seating is pretty intimate while you're dining as well -- super close to neighboring tables. But when the food is good, who cares?
Best brunch place ever! We got here around 10:30am and were seated by 11am. It's definitely a long line if you're planning to come later than that. We ordered 4 different kinds of pickles served in mason jars (special sour, hot spicy, green beans, and carrots). All were delicious but we both picked the green beans to be our favorite. The carrots were interested too because it had a cinnamon rosemary taste to it. Jacob's Pickles served the best fried chicken with pancakes. Chicken had a great southern flavor and the pancakes were fluffy likes clouds. We also got the honey chicken with pickles and we substituted the cheese grits with fries. Unlimited coffee topped off a fun and exciting brunch. Will be back again! If you doggie bag anything to go, ask to take the maple syrup home too!
"Like another reviewer said before me, ""Two Hands, Two Stars."" Don't be fooled by the high-star rating...they only have 32 reviews after all.  In my case, things were going so well when my coworker and I first visited Two Hands. We were looking to just have ONE drink each ($15 a drink for context) to celebrate the end of the work week, so we sat at the bar and got Watermelon Margaritas (they were delicious!). Our bartender was quite friendly, so we decided to stay longer and order two more drinks (a Piña Colada and ""Ashes to Ashes,"" respectively). Of course, after a while, we both got hungry. She ordered the crispy potatoes and I ordered the seafood sliders. A few minutes later, her potatoes arrived! I thought to myself, ""I guess the sliders do take longer to make,"" so I sipped on my drink and waited patiently. 10-15 minutes later, she and I watched as order after order was brought out to tables who got there much later than we did. I didn't say anything, but when I finally did, the bartender assured us that we would be getting the sliders soon. 5 more minutes pass and nothing. At this point, my coworker had finished her potatoes and was wondering where my food was. Finally, the bartender and host said that they never received the order. This is absolutely ridiculous. How could you place an order for her food and ""forget"" about mine? Lackluster service, at least when it comes to the inept kitchen staff. What if I ""forgot"" to tip (I did tip, so don't worry)?  Strangely enough, when we asked for our check, the sliders miraculously appeared! Only took them 30 minutes! At this point, I just sent them back. We were literally about to walk out the door when the host brought them over and was surprised that we didn't want them.  Long story short, make sure your food order is placed as soon as you get there - IF you go there. Our bartender was apologetic, but the rest of the waitstaff was nonchalant. One star for the bartender and one star for the drinks.  Also, pro tip: If you're going to comp something for your mistake, don't pick the cheapest item on the check. A Michelin star restaurant Two Hands is definitely not."
My friends and I arrived around 6pm on a Wednesday and it was pretty empty. We were seated even though we were waiting for 1 person. We decided to order some drinks. I just had a glass of Malbec. I try not to order chicken when I'm out to dinner because I have it so often at home, but the Mushroom Crusted Virgin Chicken with sweet pea risotto, cippolini onions, and truffle broth caught my eye. It was absolutely divine. We also split the fries with gorgonzola fondue (just a dipping sauce), mac and cheese tart, and the roasted Brussel sprouts with pancetta and caramelized apples. They were all great. The dessert, the peanut butter brownie sundae with chocolate sauce, vanilla ice cream, peanut butter, and whipped cream, was terrible. It was stale, unimaginative, and very likely not even homemade. The brownie was hard and had no flavor. Friendly's offers a better sundae. The service was terrible. There was either no one coming to our table for a long time or multiple people coming over with the same questions.   No reservations.
In fairness, I didn't try the soup dumplings, but what I did order was not great. I ordered from the lunch special, and they do give you a ton of food - entree, rice, soup, and egg roll. While the portions are generous, it doesn't help when the food itself is not good. I found the soup flavorless and inedible, though, and the rest was too greasy.
The menu looks delicious but ultimately the food fell short. I ended up getting a five spice pork burrito with a couple of the toppings. To be short, none of the fillings in my burrito really stood out. The rice tasted old, the pork had hints of nice flavor but wasn't that tender, the corn and edamame topping felt frozen, and nothing really went together. I think they're new so they still absolutely have space to improve. But, I'll probably not go back to give it a second go around.
It's a cost spot good for dinner dates. The service is fast and friendly. Good ambience with soft music. Food is fairly decent, the spicy squid was a bit disappointing - not spicy and a bit over cooked.  The other dishes were above average. All meals come with complementary salad and side dishes - seaweed salad, kimchi and spinach. Probably will not return to this fine establishment again.
I visited Vic's with family a couple of nights ago because of a recommendation from a friendly passing stranger on the streets of NYC. We called ahead to try to get on the waitlist, but the person who answered said it is a 30-40 minute wait, and we can get on the list when we arrive. When we showed up 10 minutes later, there were easily 10 tables open and no waiting. Is this a common restaurant tactic? Anyway, we were seated quickly and served by a friendly, well-mannered waiter. A couple of my family members ordered the roasted chicken and I ordered the Pacherri Rigati, a pasta, ricotta and squash dish. The portion sizes were great, but my dish was not. The pasta was really undercooked, the noodles nearly still crunchy. We sent the dish back and the waiter was apologetic and quick to get me a menu to order something else. I ordered a tomato pizza that was delivered in about another 10-15 minutes. While it was more of what I expected, the quality was still not great. The dough was stretched unevenly so the center was very thin and the edges thick and burnt. The cheese was sparse but still tasty. My family members enjoyed their roasted chicken and the atmosphere. While our server was very friendly and doing his best, I was still soured by the quality of two different dishes and will not return.
This place is amazing. I have one lyrics ever ordered delivery to work from here. The food is fantastic. Spicy and salty and everything that you crave. The Kimchi fries will haunt you. They are so delicious. The sandwiches are authentic with as many version of project as you can imagine. The food is really heavy so come hungry and leave ready to take a nap!
"Holy balls is this place good and by good I mean EVERY DISH WE ORDER WAS INCREDIBLE. The adult caprese sun drinks are also incredible. My only grip with the place is that our waiter never gave us final call and we missed out on dessert- all we got was an insensitive ""sorry"". Definitely coming back so I can finally have my dessert.."
I been trying to call them like six times, emailed and Facebook -ed trying to inquire about a reservation for a party but no one ever answers the phone!!! And just when I get a guy who answered one of my many attempts, he hung up on me after saying hello..... Horrible way to run a business!!
Fantastic Italian place in Manhattan. Great service and nice surroundings! I love the homemade black squid ink pasta! The taste is like I had one in Italy!
The last time we went we had pizzas, cacio pepe, wagyu beef carpaccio, another pasta with simple red sauce, the squid and some salads. Everything was great as it always tends to be. I have been here multiple times and will continue to go back. Just go early.
Breakfast burrito was the weakest thing I've ever eaten. Like a sock with cleaning products inside.
Great food and decent prices. Be warned, CASH ONLY!  My friends and I shared 3 plates-we all left happy and full. I wish I remembered what we ordered. I think their Malaysian spare ribs, garlic chicken, and one of their recommended noodle dishes.  It was all pretty good, although I could skip on the Malaysian fried spare ribs. I plan to return and try more of their menu when I'm not restricted by friends' food allergies.
"If I could give this ZERO stars I would. We ended up leaving after 40 minutes of sitting here. This is going to be long, and I tend to ramble so here goes... My fiance and I have never been to Roosevelt Island and we decided to check it out this past saturday. We live in Hoboken.. so not that far away.  We were seated right away, but the table was filthy and there was an old pot of coffee sitting on our table. no one came by to clean it, whatever, fine. NO ONE came over to offer us water, give us silverware, take our order for atleast 10-12 minutes. Finally the bartender came over (the only person with manners in the place) and took our drink and food order. She told us she was the bartender and she would send our server right over. She must have seen us just sitting there. 5 minutes after that a larger brown haired girl comes over to give us our napkins and silverware.. SHE DID NOT SMILE OR SAY HI. I thought that was a little off putting. You are a freaking waitress- you smile and say hi. How these people work in the service industry is beyond me. the only word we spoke was when I thanked her for putting our forks down for us and she gave a quick ""you're welcome"". Guaranteed I would not have heard a peep from her if I hadn't said thank you first.  a few minutes later a waitress came over and asked if someone took our food order. We told her yes.  7 - 10 mins after that.. ANOTHER person came over to ask if someone took our food order.. seriously?? There is a SEVERE lack of professionalism and communication going on here. We sit and sit and sit- it happened for a 3rd time. We are about to just walk out. 3 people come in and sit at the table next to us. They also waited and waited and waited.. the girl at the table flagged down a busser to get a waitress over. My finance went to use the restroom and when he came back the food STILL wasn't here.. We have now been in the restaurant seated for a total 0f 45 minutes. The only communication we have had with any of the staff is the bartender, and the ""you're welcome"" silverware girl. NOT. OKAY. WE LEFT. We decided to just up and leave. I have no idea how much the soda was but I left $2 on the table for it and we left, went back to the city, ate at a similar place and had excellent service.  I have no idea if they even put in our order or not but I have NEVER had worse service then I did at this place. They were not understaffed, and there was a large party there when we got there but that is no excuse for not saying hi, not pouring our water on time, not coming back to check on us, not letting us know ""oh so sorry about the wait! your food will be out in about 5 minutes.. sorry again"" none of that.  The waitstaff looked less than thrilled to be there also.. It was apparent to the customers also. I saw one waitress who would just not smile, not talk, walk around like she hated the place, roll her eyes, and sigh. You are in the service industry. Put a smile on your face and act like you like your job even if you don't. Or get a new job. On the way out I pulled the hostess aside and I told her about our extremely poor service. I told her our service was extremely poor and they we were leaving. She mentioned to check on our food I said no, don't bother. This is the worst service I ave ever had. We were asked if our order was taken 3 times, and the only light in the place, the bartender, took our order FOR someone on the waitstaff. She will probably remember me speaking with her so if the manager is reading this, I'm sure you can talk to the hostess about when I came up to her. It was saturday April 11th sometime around noon.  If I ever go there again, which is highly unlikely, I will sit at the bar and eat from there. NO, I would absolutely not recommend this place. The service is horrible. We waited 40 minutes for food that never came. No one came to check on us. No one had a smile on their face.  Whoever manages this place needs to have a serious team meeting about proper ways to act when working in the service industry.  It's not hard- it's common sense."
So it's okay to pour a pint an inch shy of full? It's okay to wisecrack when asked to fill the pint all the way up? I consider my tip highly generous considering such incompetencies, which I tolerated because a friend likes this bar I had guided me there.
This place is great when they actually have food but I have now been here twice when they had to stop serving because they were out of sushi rice. This past time was just before 9pm when they aren't supposed to close until 10:30pm. I'm now going to call to make sure they still have rice left before I make the trip there and I suggest you do the same.
Absolutely shocking!! I was left waiting 45 minutes. And was made to feel like crap. Couldn't even get to the bar.  I ordered my food and was offered for a supplement of $75 dollars white truffle. I ordered just one dish. No oil. No oil drizzle no oil drenched veg. AND 5g of WHITE TRUFFLE. It came covered in oil. And the truffle had been pre shaved.  NOT AT THE TABLE NOT WEIGHED. ! I asked the waitress who made me apologize for being weird. It then came back on a cold plate . Truffle was awful dinner was awful. Trendy maybe ? Shockingly bad food and service certainly!   Avoid!
Cool place, very big, it's great for large crowds. There's food, beer, games, a smoking area, everything you need in an outdoor bar. Nowadays allows kids and dogs, if one or both aren't your steez, I suggest going somewhere else. There were too many kids running around for my liking so my friends and I left. Food & beer is a bit pricey.
The meal I had here was disappointing.  I had the karaage, which was ok but not great. I also had the Zurutto Ramen which has a chicken broth base.  I thought the base was unpleasantly thick and not particularly tasty.  Unlike others that have posted, I did not find it sweet so much as just unappealing. The only positive I have is that the wait staff was very attentive.  I can't imagine I would return here.  You're better off walking uptown to Jin Ramen in the 80's.
I love Ippudo ramen. Without a doubt, it is the absolute best spot for Ramen in the city. The akamaru modern is delicious and there is nothing better than a pork bun. However, be PREPARED to wait. You will wait. You will wait quite a long time. You will wait so long you will wonder if its worth it. It is always worth it. This location is definitely a bit nicer and brighter than the one downtown. The atmosphere is much less rushed and the food is equally delicious.
I don't write reviews often, but after having the best seafood of my life here, I feel compelled to do so. Frank is the MAN and took great care of us. We had the clam linguini which gave me a new perspective of life itself. I might travel back to NYC just to eat here again.
Not the best steak. Still prefer capital grille more-even tho its a chain. Spent $285 for 2 ppl and still didn't come out satisfied. Friend and I grabbed halal guys afterwards
I am Australian so naturally couldn't wait to try out this new location of Two Hands in my neighborhood, TriBeCa, but unfortunately I was pretty underwhelmed.  I have come a few times for brunch but have never been able to get a table, even on a weekday and as a party of one, but the bar is pretty comfortable so I was okay to be seated here.  However - a word of warning, brunch is crazy busy so come prepared to wait. For dinner, you can make a reservation on open table.  Now, to the food.  The brunch food is fine.  Just fine.  I don't really understand what the crazy line is for since the quality and taste of the food seems pretty average to me.  The coffee is good - very strong but small cups and they don't have skim milk so it can also be quite rich.   Dinner is also just fine.  Good for a quick and healthy-ish meal, but nothing I'd find myself craving again.  The ambience is nice and the staff are friendly, but nothing really stands out to me.  The one definite negative to me was the chocolate dessert, which I found to be pretty flavorless.  All in all, try it to try it, but it's not somewhere I think is worth the long brunch wait.
With all the talk about how difficult it is to get a reservation at Babbo, I immediately checked and booked a table via Opentable exactly a month in advance for the boyfriend and I's anniversary.  My boyfriend was running late, so I informed the host of this. He told me this wasn't a problem and to wait at the bar and inform him when my boyfriend arrived. However, when my boyfriend arrived 15 minutes later, the host said due to the lateness and timing, he gave our table away. I was absolutely flabbergasted...how do you tell your guests that you gave their table away when they made a reservation? Sure my boyfriend was late, but you accepted this fact in advance. Anyways, we were given a corner table by the bar instead, which felt so unwelcoming and so far away from the main dining table. This should have been my sign to just leave because if things couldn't have gone worse, EVERYTHING continued to go downhill from there. But I couldn't just leave due to having already arrived at Babbo and anticipated a great meal.  We were greeted with the amuse of the chickpea crostini while we waited for the famous beef cheek ravioli and the wild boar ragu pappardelle. Within minutes of ordering, our pasta dishes came out practically instantly. Instantly as in we didn't even really touch, let alone finish the chickpea crostini. In fact, the waiter took the crostini away from us without even asking. The quickness was portrayed in the pasta as they were both cold. However, we couldn't tell the waiter because he was nowhere to be found. At this point, I was super unimpressed with Babbo and wanted to leave instantly.  All in all, Babbo was so much excitement and anticipation wasted. From the service to the food, there are way better restaurants out there.
This place is awesome. I recently proposed to my girlfriend at Brooklyn Bridge Park and I decided to celebrate afterwards at a new restaurant. I choose Atrium Dumbo because of the location and the menu was unique. I made reservations for two over the phone and informed the hostess that I was proposing prior to my arrival and asked him if I can be seated upstairs because I heard it was a more romantic setting. He was upfront with me and told me he couldn't promise it would be available but he will try.              After celebrating my new engagement I actually arrived 25 minutes late of my reservation time AND informed the hostess i had another couple with us that obviously wasn't planned and asked if it would be a problem seeing that my reservation was only for two. The hostess handled it quickly and very professionally. He said it wasn't a problem and the four of us can be seated in 10 minutes and in my desired upstairs section. That dude saved the day for me.               Once we got seated the manager was notified of our special occasion and gave us a bottle of champagne on the house. The look on my fiancé face was so joyful because of the way the staff treated us like family. I couldn't ask for anything more from them. They exceeded all my expectations. Oh and by the way, that lobster Mac & Cheese is a bowl of heaven.                I can promise that we will be coming back here every year to celebrate our future anniversaries. ......and several times in between.
"Happy to be back in the neighborhood my partner and i googled brunch spots and Sweet Brooklyn got GREAT reviews. We were hype about trying them so we walked in what seemed to be a closed door and found it to be open. The four people stood and watched us hesitantly and not one person greeted or asked if they could help us. I proceeded to ask ""are you guys open?"". One of the staff says to us ""we will be at 11."" So we turned and walked out. My partner and i looked at our watches and it was 10:57.... REALLY????! Not even a come in sit down for a minute. No customer service.  We wont be back... We wont endorse you. SHAME ON YOU."
Very tiny place , food was good which is why I am giving it 2 stars. But the waiters were RUDE . They would constantly stand over you in a weird way almost so close , if I turned we would tap kiss. Asking if I wanted water..... uh ??? TF.. at one point our party of 12 , drinking having a good time. Waiter comes and throws the check on our table. Doesn't ask if we are done or anything. I felt beyond rushed & wasn't really a pleasant time... I wouldn't return due to this. But mac & cheese is CRACK it's so good.
Amazing rolls, I enjoyed the bread to seafood ratio, there wasn't too much bun and plenty of lobster. Ask for melted butter it's worth it! It was a bit packed around 1 pm but didn't have to wait long.
So overated   Waited for a table when im lookig at a whole barage of tables that arent being used. U guess that they want you to just keep ordering pricey drinks that arent plentiful to sat the least. Dont come thirsty otherwise Bring your cash bamk jf you do. Food was ok.  Nothing crazy, tasty to some degree but i would have liked a little more pizzazz for the location and price.
Great atmosphere at this place, they really try and make it an immersive experience in the ambiance. They have numerous TVs, but don't expect to find the game or a headline of Trump's latest blunders scrolling across the screen. Instead, you'll find old black and white Charlie Chapman type skits playing, or other historic pieces that really help to add to the ambiance. The flooring is wooden, as are the tables, and it helps to give it the ale house vibe I feel they're going for. I only came here for drinks, but the menu looked delicious, and I wish I hadn't already eaten dinner. I know the food would be good too, because our waitress told us this is a sister restaurant to the Three Monkey's, and for anyone in the know that place has some of the best food you'll find in Midtown. Anyways, I had a smoked whisky that had a very charming presentation. It came bottled and corked in an old glass jar, with the smoking whisping about on the interior. Certainly got top marks on that alone, but the taste was great as well. A very rich and smoke flavor to it, only the second time I've had a smoked cocktail before. All in all, this is a quaint spot to grab a drink, and what I assume would be good food too.
Great Moroccan food! I had the fish tagine, which was flavor but not over the top. The spicy broth was special but it wasn't that much. My friend liked her chicken tagine. I tried hers and thought the sauce was also very unique. First Moroccan food experience in New York.
"I've got to say, I had a great experience and the place lived up to the hype. My girlfriend and I came here tonight to celebrate our half anniversary and we had a great dining experience. The restaurant's sleek and sexy interior is hidden by a plain exterior, but the place really opens up once you step into the cozy and warm space. Make sure you get reservations, too. The restaurant was pretty full on a saturday evening at 6:15. The waiter recommended we each order 2-3 items and share them family style, so we got the orecchiette, linguine nero (squid ink pasta), branzino filet and olive oil cake. The orecchiette ($20) took a bit to get used to because it's initially very salty. The sausage and salami hit you hard, but the pasta helps to balance the dish. Still a bit saltier than I'd like it to be, but the dish was well composed, rich and hearty. Note that there was a bitter vegetable in the pasta, and every few bites I would get what tasted like burnt garlic. That was rather unpleasant. The linguine nero ($24) was much lighter in flavor. It comes with shrimp and breadcrumbs and its flavor is almost too nuanced. We warmed up to it pretty quickly, though, and my girlfriend said she liked it more than the orecchiette. The branzino filet ($22) was delicious. Cooked with honey and lemon, it tasted perfect and had a perfectly crispy skin. The price was a bit high for the portion size, but aside from that it was beautiful. Lastly, we finished off with the highly touted olive oil cake ($10). We were a bit hesitant because it doesn't sound good, but trust me -- it was delicious. Splendid. Fabulous. Sweet but not too sweet by any means, the cake was moist and the bursts of salt provided even deeper flavor profiles. I can't sing enough praises for this cake. The service was the cherry on top. Attentive but not overbearing, the knowledgeable staff guided us through a fantastic evening. Prices were to be expected, and while portion sizes seemed small, we left feeling full (but not the ""I'm going to die"" full). I will certainly come back here when another occasion permits."
I don't understand why people wait soo long for mediocre dim sum. I am from Hong Kong and managed to find a great Dim Sum place in Boston (Windsor) and was hoping to do the same in New York. However, the food didn't taste fresh and relied on being deep fried and/or salty to be perceived as tasty.   We ordered rice in lotus leaf, shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings, sweet sesame balls, pan friend dumplings and pork buns. The sticky rice was solid but very bland in taste. The dumpling fillings were ill proportioned and sometimes extremely salty. The sesame balls had barely any sesame in them. The pork buns were the only stable dish of the meal.  Very disappointing. Will not return but will continue searching.
Finally made it to this place, and it lived up to the hype! The decor was more modern than I had expected out of a French wine bar, but I liked it. I was trying to be healthy, so I ordered the Amelie salad. Wow, it was good! Would definitely order it again. The happy hour wine flights (available until 7pm) are a great deal. I loved all the wines I tried. Glad to have another nice but affordable spot to eat/drink in the Village.
-Outside seating  -Amazingly delicious BBQ shrimp and grits portion size.  -Spicy chicken sandwich was good but not amazing.  -Friendly staff.
"Had a very good experience here on a Tuesday night.  The wait was long, more than 30 minutes - it's popular!  The restaurant was 100% full until about 9pm.  The system is modern though and we were texted shortly before the table was ready. Portions were larger than expected for a tapas place.  We were satisfied with 4 dishes for 2 people. - Steak: amazing - beautifully cooked, well-seasoned.  Came with delicious feta grits and kale.  All unique tastes. - Sweet potato fries (flash fried): excellent.  As was the sriracha goat cheese on the side.  However, they're not a good combo - the goat cheese completely overpowers the sweet potato taste.  Eating these separate was fine, but in my opinion they don't belong in the same dish. - Octopus: subtle and nice - quite tasty, and the Riesling gel was new, if not totally remarkable.   - Mapo Tofu: the least interesting item.  Probably should not have ordered a Chinese dish at a Korean restaurant.  Authentic Chinese mapo tofu (all that I've had at least) has much more ma spice.  This dish tasted somewhat spicy and not much else.  Definitely skip this one, I hope they replace it with something more Korean-influenced and distinctively flavored. - Popcorn ice cream: excellent.  The popcorn is mixed in with the ice cream so you don't get that ""toppings are gone, now I just have plain ice cream left.""  Vanilla gelato and salted caramel sauce were perfect and well-balanced. Overall, a really nice night that could be improved with a couple menu tweaks."
No, you're getting the dessert menu because there are people waiting for you table. Sorry. Seriously? this is how you treat people these days? We were there for a little under an hour. We sat down basically the same time as the table next to us, while they gave us the bill, people next to us got the dessert menu. Of course we asked for the menu, that was the answer we got. You know, your apology is meaningless when you don't mean it. When you said you're sorry after you deliberately hurt somebody, you're the fine example of hypocrisy.
"Overpriced and mostly mediocre tacos.  Mostly friendly, but indifferent service (didn't even bother to offer us chips and dip like in other tables).  Cramped uncomfortable dining experience during the wintertime if you're seated on those raised-up cold metal benches by the outside window.   In other words, nothing is really worth it here.  The soup and tamale we ordered as starters was meh.  Likewise, the tacos.  Especially for the price.  In addition to the starters, my companion and I shared 6 tacos, including the vastly overpriced fish taco ($6!!!).  We ended up paying about $43 including tip and left feeling hungry.   The only saving grace?  The Al Pastor taco, as featured in Guy Fieri's TV show, is quite sublime.  If you do come here, I would suggest ordering the ""make your own taco"" for just Al Pastor.  Or just order individual Al Pastor tacos.  Everything else is no better than $1.50-2 tacos from anywhere else."
This place has clearly been reviewed by tons/ but I would definitely recommend getting the pork buns/ I'd never had them before which was a mistake/ this is the place for a cozy lunch date.
"Every time I walk by this place is bustling with a fun vibe. Finally got to try and wish the food was the same.  ""For the table"" appetizers are more for 2, grilled octopus is 2 tentacles but will say cooked to perfection with good accompaniments. Fried calamari - batter fell off but calamari was tender. Dipping sauce is good with a spicy kick, fried green beans good also.  Brown butter gnocchi was over cooked, I preferred the lamb ragu. Other pastas were cooked al dente. Ribeye was a perfect rare, veal milanase was seasoned well and crispy.  The restaurant has more of an industrial feel which is diff for the area but I'd prefer more a traditional feel."
It's been difficult to review Italian places because I've found myself relegated to mostly the salad and fish parts of the menu. Lately, I'm becoming less interested in animal meat (with the exception of a bite of my boyfriend's burger) and, though I am still an avid pasta-eater, I've come to realize that the effects of a massive plate of carbs (because I will finish the whole thing AND some of the complimentary bread) outweigh the initial burst of euphoria. (cue the boos)  But what usually ends up happening is I'll have a relatively virtuous entree and then go HAM on whatever dessert one of my tablemates ends up ordering. The salmon with some kind of mango and veggie slivers was cooked well but the dish was a whole was extremely oily. I'm not one to shy away from olive oil or butter - this had me wiping off my mouth at every bite.  I did like everything else about the meal, however: (1) the nutty, seed-studded house bread provided before the meal (bread is definitely something that will have to be pried out of my cold, dead hands); (2) the Nutella cheesecake with the giant swath of caramel syrup along the side; (3) the biscotti they gave on the side that I almost broke my teeth on but were still so, so good; and (4) I liked the broccoli rabe much more than the veggies with the salmon.  I feel like I always end up raving about the side dishes/desserts more so than the main course. Such is the life of a chocolate-holic.
Pretty good tacos, nothing that really made them stand out but they were enjoyable. The taco platter was a trio of tacos (of your choosing.) The grilled steak, spicy pork, and tempura fish were all good. Each one seemed to be topped with the same things, chopped tomato salsa and cheese sauce. The morsels were gone quickly. The bacon jalapeño hotdog was pretty good, also topped with cheese sauce, tomato salsa, and a bit of green onion. I would have liked there to have been more of a snap to the hotdog and the bun was a bit too small. The mint lemonade was pretty good, very mild, rather light on lemon flavor and not very sweet. There was a lot of mint leaves in it even though the mint flavor wasn't strong. There were some lemon wedges too. The place has the look and feel of a fast food bar. Not too clean, a bit messy, only a few high shared tablespoon stools. It's better as a place for takeout or to pop in for a quick bite.
"What an experience. I tend to like spicy, unique flavored drinks and ""smoke"" hit that spot. It even had bacon flavored salt to go with the smoke taste. Such a unique drink. We then feasted on our servers recommendation of the oxtail dim sum- amazing. I was sad it was gone so fast!  We also had the shrimp toast... good but the oxtail ruined me for anything else. Our meals were the ribeye and the cod. Both absolutely amazing. The ribeye was in a sauce that was so tangy and we ordered the lobster fried rice on the side with some charred broccoli. I have nothing negative to say about my meal. The best part... dessert. This is the type of place where you must save room for dessert.  It was a culinary experience all on its own... and I normally don't like dessert. We ordered the crying chocolate and the bread pudding. The ice creams were even delicious.   We spent a pretty penny but we knew this going in. Hey, you live once!  Only downfall- which was a minor one- when we asked to bag our food they put everything together when we said separate.  That did upset me because the food was so good we wanted our left overs so badly but, we worked it out! (I was not leaving without my food!)"
Great clean and well appropriate classy little pasta place. Service was exquisite and the parts clean in flavor.  I'll definitely try this place again as I was in a hurry cause I arrived 20mins b4 closing.
If you're looking for super delicious inexpensive lobster roll, this is certainly the place! The lobster roll is packed with chunks of lobster meat  mixed with mayo and topped with some paprika and scallions. The price was only $17, but 2 dollars extra for the BLT one. Besides for the tasty lobster roll, the appetizers were decent. The fried pickles were a little different than what I expected. It was actually bigger chunks of pickles fried. I expected the thin sliced one and I do prefer them more. The lobster bisque was a tad bit too salty and the lobster cheese fries were a little burnt. Overall, I gave this place 4 stars because the waitress was very friendly and the lobster rolls were awesome.
"The atmosphere of the place was decent...nothing stellar, but the the bartender (guy, late 30s) was a jovial spirit.  He got me started with a beer that worked perfectly for what I was craving at the time. The main point to my review is the food.  It was amazing.  I came for the poutine that I'd been craving but the menu has recently changed due to a new chef or some nonsense to that matter.  Instead of leaving, seeing as I was already enjoying a great craft brew, I opted to go all out and order the Steak-Frites ($23).  When the plate came to me with an already cut into strips steak with a nice garnish or carmelized onions and shallots (I believe) draped ever so delicately with a healthy serving of fries to adorn the presentation, I thought, ""look at this sh*t,"" sarcastically.  Nevertheless I dove into the first strip and was immediately sent into culinary ecstasy.  The steak was the best that I've had in quite a long while.  It was just juicy and tender and cooked to a perfect medium well as I requested.  The fries were nicely seasoned and a mixture regular and sweet potato fries. Additionally, my companion had the Burger with pimento cheese and some other fixings.  It was well-cooked and pretty decent, but the flavor was lacking a bit.  I expected more seeing as the steak was so amazing. Overall, good visit and I'd stop in again for another happy hour."
The only sucky part is the wait ..but as you're waiting you always get complementary wine as you wait :) ..the food is always up to par and so is the service. They are always attentive and very friendly ..if I don't mind waiting and the weather is nice this is my go to Greek :)
Very polite staff and great vibes classy trendy decor. Pineapple fried rice is really good and drinks aren't expensive at all. Love it!
Didfn't have a reservation but got there right when they opened on a Friday night and there was already a line, I knew this place was going to be good.  We had soft, fluffy, lemony ricotta with buttermilk crackers with sea salt, truffle cheese to start.  I had a cavatelli pasta with sausage, roasted tomatoes, and other veggies, it was delicious.   My partner had bucatini which was delicious.  The waiter selected a great bottle of wine from southern Italy.  Service was impeccable.  We even got to sit at the chef's counter, which is my absolutely favorite thing to do. Great place to eat!
The brunch menu is very limited. We had the Brussels sprouts which was nice and the CV burger which was okay. The $21 huevos divorciados was a disaster and took the time it took for my fellow diner to receive his food and finish it and wait another 10 minutes before mine arrived, not cooked to my specifications. Overpriced and not worth a visit in my opinion. This place is non descript from the outside. It looks like a store about to close down but the inside is surprise back garden and a quaint but sparsely decorated interior.
Friendly attentive bar service that's well worth visiting to hear the Brazilian accent.   I love the huge screen TV (of course on a sports channel).
My wife and son brought me to Maialino to celebrate my birthday. The space is handsomely designed: stylish, inviting and comfortable. We were seated promptly and service started. The staff were all personable but we had four or five different people attend to our table before one introduced herself as our waitress. Although she was nice, as the restaurant filled, we were forgotten.  Wine we ordered to have with our dinner came after the food was eaten. Coffee went cold waiting for the milk we ordered for it. The leftover scaloppine we asked to take home never came back from the kitchen. The staff grew increasingly scarce as the meal progressed. Our food, and in particular the pastas, may have been good but they were salted so heavily it was hard to get a true sense of the flavors, so maybe it was a stroke of luck that the take home never materialized.  While the service was disappointing by 'harried waitstaff at a mall chain-restaurant' standards, it was even more so for a Danny Meyer restaurant. Maialino managed to deliver a very un-Danny Meyer like experience: I left not wanting to come back.
"I had the baby yellowtail sushi special, live Uni and Chirashi, which also came with Miso Soup. My guest tried to order the Beef Yakitori, and they ran out of it. Then, she tried to order the live scallops, and they were also out of that. So she ordered the Salmon skin hand roll. The miso soup arrived, and there was no complaints about that. The baby yellowtail sushi special was delicious. It came on a bed of lettuce, avocado slices and sprouts. It had a light dressing on it and did not need any additional sauces. All the flavored worked really well together. With that being said, they kept the lettuce as one big piece, which made it really inconvenient to eat. We had to request for a knife to cut through the large chunk of lettuce and then the entire dish fell apart. It would have been much better if the lettuce was already sliced or shredded. We tried to recommend that to the owner, but he didn't seem to care. The live Uni came, and that was presentation at its best!  They had the Uni meat positioned over a green leafy vegetable on top of the Uni shell. This was my first experience with live Uni, but I really enjoyed it!  My guests have had it before elsewhere and said that it was definitely the largest slivers of Uni that they have ever seen!  So at a price of $22 for this large Uni, they were very pleased. I did enjoy the Chirashi sushi entree. It's a great value, as you get a nice sized bowl of rice topped with three different pickled vegetables, ginger, and 3 pieces of salmon, 3 pieces of yellowtail, 2 pieces of tuna and 2 pieces of cooked octopus... All for $15!  It was very filling! Then they brought out the salmon skin sushi roll for my guest... Did you catch that mistake?  She ordered the hand roll and now had to wait another 15 minutes for the correct salmon skin hand roll to arrive. Another guest had ordered the hibachi salmon with fried rice, and they brought her meal out with steamed rice. Then we tried to order the Green Tea Crepe Cake and were really excited about it because we were told by the waiter that it was from Lady M's Confections. Only to discover a few minutes later that they had run out of it. Overall, the food was actually really good here. But the service and lack of ""inventory"" was sub-par this time around."
Be warned: this place automatically puts tofu in their Pad Thai. I was like what are these nasty chunks? I called and they let me know this is their standard. Gross. Who would want tofu and chicken. Anyways I could get over this and just be specific in a later order, BUT the pad Thai was dry and lacked spices or flavor. So no thanks. I won't return.   I'm throwing this whole $17.42 meal in the garbage. Where it belongs.
This place was great! Hearty, flavorful food that was clearly very fresh and special. Our server Amanda was fantastic--very helpful and friendly. The Root of all Evil was definitely the best cocktail so don't miss that. The herbal notes go great with the carrot juice and gin. While all the food was great, everything was a little salty and rich.
"TBH, I avoided Ayada for a while since my last review (before it started going through what I refer to as ""Sripraphai-ism"" - you know, when you buy the up half of the block and expand? I really doubted that expansion could have done anything good for this place. Unfortunately, I was right.  I gave the place another try, not because I wanted to, but because I was with a friend and Khao Kang didn't take plastic. So, we ended up here. And I was disappointed.  The decor was great but you could tell that the food was not going to be. How could a Thai restaurant positioned in Queens' main Thai neighborhood not have any Thai diners inside it except for me? After seating ourselves and waiting for one of the two waitresses to gossiping with one another by the bar to come to us, I found out. Over the years, the food went from amazing to ok. to meh. The food wasn't Thai anymore. (Sorry, folks, Thai people don't eat pad thai, let alone vegetarian pad thai). And then there was the tom yum soup was way too sweet and it came luke warm. But since they waitresses were busy chatting with their backs turned to the entire dining room, we just made do. Yep, that service was beyond disappointing. 8 minutes for someone to get us a spoon, 14 minutes for a check. I'm glad we weren't in a rush. You're out, Ayada. I miss the old days. So sad."
This place is cool to check out once for the experience, but it's touristy and pricey.  I had brunch here with my wife and friends. We got the pastry basket to share, the burger, and norwegian benedict.  The burger was just ok, nothing special. The benedict was tasty but very average. The pastry basket had a lot of options. But I was a bit disappointed with some of the pastries being a bit stale. This place is known for their baked goods, so would have wanted fresher items. Note: this place is popular so be prepared to wait.
I really wanted to like this place because of their niku - uni but I find this place to be overhyped and overpriced. I was still hungry after I left and for two people our bill was 140 bucks..  We had niku uni, beef tartare, beef tongue sampler, matcha maekolli, nakokochi kalbi and fish bone dumpling with bone marrow.  The uni and beef was fighting with eachother because both are great things on its own, it was overwhelming in flavor. The beef tartar I liked surprisingly even though it was raw beef. They mix it with a quail egg. Matcha maekolli was a rip off for a cup it was 12 bucks and there was no matcha flavor.. Neither was there much alcohol.  The kalbi and tongue sampler was okay, small portions though...  The fish bone dumpling was almost a hazard, I nearly choked on a bone... I wanted to keep the bone marrow and doggy bag it but the server said they need it?!?! And he refused to give it to me... I didn't know they reused bones for future dishes.. And I thought I paid for the bone since its in my dish ???  Overall, I'm not interested in coming back not only are you not allowed to make reservations ( unless it's a party of four or more ) you have to go in person to put your name down, the wait is usually 45 mins up to 2 hours..  Overpriced, overhyped, disappointed.
I can only review my experience visiting this spot one time on a Thurs night. Eh. I ordered the tagliata (steak) and it wasn't good. A poor cut of meat, tough with gristle. It's always touchy to send something back and it would've kept me in the restaurant longer than I wanted. My view is that steak should never have gotten to the table in the first place. Waste of money. Waitress was very good.
I did not expect much but this tavern was a lot of fun and they have some good food.  The tavern is also a lot bigger than it looks.  Some good beers on tap and the appetizers were great.  We had an order of the Lamb Lollipops and then got a second one it was so good.  Good burgers and good salads.  Good staff too. One other plus is the decor is mostly wood on the inside.  Almost an old fashioned wood.  Looking forward to going back.
This place is overrated. You order fresh squeezed juice and you get tropicana orange juice. You order steak & scramble and you get canned meat. Brunch here is just a complete joke. Maybe drinks could be good if you eat small dishes after being drunk.  If you look for brunch, try Ltauha Restaurant instead. You will get quality local food.
"I had a disappointing experience here. My boss made a reservation for our team holiday lunch, and when we showed up there was no table available. My boss showed our confirmation email, and the waiter/hostess/ owner (?) agreed that we did indeed have a reservation, and told us that a table would be open in ""10-15 minutes""...and pointed to a small table where they had just gotten their food. We hung around for a few more minutes and were given no further explanation so we decided to leave and eat elsewhere. As we were leaving we passed another group of 4 who also had a reservation (at the same time as us), and no available table. We watched as the same man told them it would be ""10-15 minutes,"" and they looked around confused (as we were) because all of the tables were full and no where near done. Perhaps there was some kind of error with their online reservation system, but we were never given a reason, and this was a big inconvenience."
Came here for lunch during the week. Their lunch special items are pretty decent. The portions were too small but the overall balance of what was on the plate was alright. I had the salmon avocado lunch meal.  It seems like a bento box: a piece of salmon with sweet tangy sauce that tasted like teriyaki sauce, avocado tempura, wild rice, boiled squash, soup and field greens and some dressing. It seems like a lot but again the portions are teeny weeny.  The interiors are rustic, and the color palette is welcoming. I just dont get the messy service station in the middle. The clientele are midtown corporate people while the staff are Asians. It's pretty busy for lunch even if they are cash only.
Had a party of 12 people here: Terrible service - over an hour wait for main course to come out, disorganized waiters, 1 waiter per 5-6 tables. Slow, unfriendly. Summer day - AC barely working. Everyone was sweating (including the waiters), but they kept saying the AC is on and they cannot do anything about it Food - was average. Absolutely nothing special and with all of the great restaurants on Coney Island... This place won't last much longer. PS they didn't even ask to bring out water for the table.... Pros - very cheap (but you pay for what you get - terrible service, uncomfortable environment and average food). Try something else instead!
We decided to give this place a try since there were many reviews about it. First time going there on a Wednesday night around 6:30 and was told that the wait for 1 hour. The three of us decided to wait at the entrance of the restaurant. After one hour of waiting, we went back to ask the hostess who said our names were crossed out because one of us requested for it, literally we were standing outside the entrance and our name wasn't called. This was very disorganized. We decided to leave.  Second attempt, we came on Sunday night around 6pm and there was no wait. But we were seated right in front of the entrance. It was really cold that day. People keep coming in and out. All the customers were squished in and you can literally hear the entire conversation of the people next to you. The waiters keep passing by me and knocking my jacket and purse here and there.  Monkfish: tasted like solid chicken liver. No flavor.  Yaki Soba Omelette : noodles with ketchup egg wrap. Can't describe much for this. Basically taste like chow mien with eggs and lots of ketchup.  Another Special with mix food: clams were undercook. Beef was dried. Don't get this dish. I feel like it's a mix of left over.  Salmon: Your salmon with teriyaki sauce, no wow factor.  Water was never refilled and no attentions from the waiters.
So after having a great time at a indoor golf establishment, we decided to get a quick bite to eat. So we helped and this place can up. When we got there, the place had a great Decor with stickers all over the place. We thought that was kinda cool. We was told to sit anywhere we liked but had to order at the bar which was fine with us. There was only the bartender no sever. They have a wide variety of beers which was great. When our food came it wasn't what we had expected. The portion was way smaller then what other yelpers had posted. That was pretty odd so I thought. So we finished up and asked for the check. Since we were on a budget, we ordered to fit our budget. The bill was right at our price range but here's the kicker....CASH ONLY!!!! Wow..there was no signs anywhere or that was visible that said that. I had to overdraft my account to pay for a bill...smh!!! Shame on you to this establishment, your new customers should be aware it cash only. Please put up signs....disappointment and overdraft
Have eaten here multiple times. Nice service quick meal. Pleasant atmosphere. Good bear selection. Lots of TV,s all over the place.
It's an embarrassment to pasta. Brought some friends here since I was told it was a good spot and the reviews on Yelp looked solid and when everyone at the table made clear they were not happy with their food, I was mortified. I also did not like my salad or dish of fettuccine with carbonara sauce. There's no way to describe it except bad, like almost Olive Garden bad. The service was also terrible, we had to ask for water, olive oil, small plates, etc. Atmosphere was tourist / B&T / non-natives on a Thursday night around 7pm. To add insult to injury, this cost me $34. It's actual value lies in to-go pasta for $8, at most. Strongly advise against this place.
The lure and location of the place is fantastic. You walk in and feel like you're getting something unique. The food doesn't match the setting though. They are advertised as a Gastropub, but you definitely don't get that vibe from the menu. Their beer and cocktails selection is a missed opportunity given their atmosphere. A couple cool signature cocktails, or even a cocktail menu, would really put this place on the map. The food is pretty decent, again though, doesn't match the place. Honestly though, it's nothing to write home about. Check out Bill's Westside Bar if you want the vibe that should go with a place with the name of Suspenders.
OMG. I wish I was able to take pictures of the food but.. I was too hungry.  First off, my parents recommended to go to this Malaysian restaurant because they've been there before and said the food is good. So I went with my family of 6.5 (a baby for the half hahaa) during dinner time about 7pm. We were seated soon. The menu was great for the kids and the adults as it contains English, Chinese and pictures of the dishes.  Cutting to the chase, the food was delicious. We ordered the young chow fried rice, shrimp with lady fingers Malaysian style, shrimp with string beans Malaysian style and curried beef.  The fried rice was good, it wasn't overly flavored. The veggies were yummy and the curried beef wasn't too spicy because sometimes I just suck with spice, but my goodness, it was good! Also, the beef were perfectly tender. Yumm! I would definitely go back again next time with family and/ or friends and next time, I'll get photos!
The food was decent. It's really fried though. The original egg roll was so bad. The turnip patty was soppy in fried oil, I couldn't taste the cake itself. The stuffed eggplant was ok. The fried crab claw was pretty neat and tasty. House dumpling and soup dumpling were good. There was a wait to sit at a table, which is fine, we sat at the bar stool area. 3 tables opened up at the same time and we asked if we could move to one of them and they weren't accommodating or polite about it. The bathroom isn't nice. It stinks like fried food on the restaurant. Honestly it's kind of dirty. It's not worth the headache that is Chinatown.
I like the inviting vibe of Smith with a good variety of choices for food. The restaurant has a lot of open space with a bright clean feel to it. If you are here for a business lunch/dinner, it can get quite loud with background music sometimes yet a great spot for family gathering and friends hang-out.  One of the great things about the Smith is that they serve both still water and sparkling water to its customers. I normally order their salmon dish (forgive me for forgetting the name); it's so tender and juicy!  The Smith is also a great spot for Sunday brunch!
Where can I start with this review ? Well to be quite honest they have teenage girls working the counter and they are extremely rude and unconcerned . I am not sure id it is because I travelled here on a late night close to the time where they were about to leave however ; I was disgusted . They continued to cuss and carry on for about 5 minutes and I had to interrupt their conversation to even ask for a receipt ... okay ? Not the best first experience but whatever . So my order was completely wrong once I got home and checked the bag and that was a bit of heartbreak for the 88 dollars I spent there . Husband and kids said the food was tasty however they were expecting the shrimp to actually be spicy as opposed to just scarcely dipped in a spicy sauce . The decor of the restaurant is very cute and I get the idea in which they were trying to go for however , I think it's a NO for me . I can't get over the immaturity of the employees and that alone sets aside a perfect business from a shabby one .
Fellow Brooklynites rave about this place, and I don't get it.  I've dined here many times, mainly because a) Brooklyn Heights has a dearth of good restaurants, b) its cheap, and c) I keep thinking I'm missing something so I try and try again.   Noodle Pudding is really popular, so make sure you are willing to wait on weekends and prime dinner hours.  Service is never great, maybe because they are so busy or maybe because its more authentic with a gruff edge - who knows?  Room is a little bit of a mishmash, nice woodsy warm coupled with a rotating selection of kitchy artwork.  As for the food, I've gone through a fair amount of the pastas on the menu, and I've found all of them to be acceptable but not deserving of the raves of other red sauce pasta shops.   Sigh!  I guess I am missing something...  However, the food is very affordable and the wine is even more so, so three stars overall, but Noodle Pudding.. like its name... is a real head scratcher for me. Cash ONLY, so make sure you hit the ATM before hand.
My wife, kid and me went to get some good Italian experience. Maybe We choose the wrong time or place. The appetizers were not available and the waiters where a little over the top. Some waiter stepped over a dropt dirty plates over me. Too many waiters for that little space. We ordered bolognese fettuccine and stuffed shells: both pretty standard and quite plane. Maybe not that Italian, more a kind of bland commercial microwave ready food.
Chef selection is good for first time. Every dish offers a great combination, melting in the mouse and lingering.
We were seated and did not get waited on for quite some time. It would appear our waitress was new. She wound up leaving abruptly during our stay.
They tried to trick us by serving salmon instead of the trout we'd ordered, and expected us not to notice. Disturbing and overrated.
Awesome place for lunch! I came here during my lunch break and I got the breakroom burger, 3 tacos (skirt steak, chipotle chicken, and tempura fish), and a mint lemonade. The burger was great but a little messy so make sure to grab a lot of napkins. Each type of taco was delicious, I think my favorite was the fish taco. The mint lemonade was very refreshing and certainly not something you come across by everyday. I still need to try their breakroom fries which are suppose to be crack.  This place is a little small so it's a little hard to notice it but it was packed inside. They also have a great selection of hot sauce.  Can't wait to come back when the weather clears up
This was easily one of the best Italian meals I've had in New York. The simple pasta dish is just as good as everyone else here writes. Came her with my boyfriend for an anniversary dinner, they had a card on the table for us saying happy anniversary and also gave us a complimentary dessert. Besides the Spaghetti, we split the chicken. The chicken skin was perfectly crispy and the the meat was juicy. Also, the bread basket at the beginning comes WARM!  Decor is modern but rustic, with mirrors everywhere and dark leather seats. There are wooden beams along the ceiling and potted plants along the wall.  Not too loud so come with a group or family, or for a delicious meal for a special occasion!
I had a work dinner here last night. Between the five of us, we tried: - syrian cheese with beets, studded with cumin and sesame - stewed favas and chickpeas - rolls of chard/tzatziki - asparagus, smoked seeds and Bulgarian feta - harissa rabbit leg rutabaga taco - chicken, kohlrabi, garlic scapes and dukka - hanger steak, marrow, charred pickled cabbage - lavendar chocolate mousse - rosewater custard with pistachio, peach, and rhubarb - labneh parfait with fennel/olive oil crisps - flatbread - zweigelt wine Standouts were the rolls of chard (they looked like grape leaves and were stuffed with rice with this delicious feta and sauce combination and I think maybe pickled radish? STELLAR), the asparagus (I almost licked the plate of all the delicious green sauce. I would have if it wasn't a business dinner), the rabbit tacos, and the steak. But EVERYTHING was incredible. From the dessert, I LOVED the labneh parfait - in fact, I ignored my table in a very unprofessional way to just basically down that dessert.  Although I had favorites, I have to emphasize that here, more so than most places, my favorites were determined solely by flavors that I prefer, not the inherent goodness of the dishes. My whole table walked away with different favorites because we preferred different kinds of tastes and textures, not because any of the dishes were less than sublime. The flavor combinations, the uses of different spices and herbs, the focus on textures... this food was fascinating AND delicious. There was always a surprise that elevated every single dish. Others' favorites were the steak and the stewed favas. I would so happily eat every single thing that we ordered again. We had some minor service glitches - not enough water, slow to bring the wine out - but these were more than offset by the sweetness and helpfulness of our server. She actually steered us away from ordering too much and helped us make sure our meal was balanced. That kind of honest helpfulness is rare in restaurants - normally they try to get you to over-order. I think any glitches came from the restaurant just being very busy, which makes sense - the food blew me away.  Interesting wine list! I can't comment on the prices or relative values, but I was very excited to see some Croatian wines on the menu - the sommelier must be quite adventurous. The wine we ordered unfortunately didn't pair very well with our food, so I don't think I got the best impression of it, but I'd be happy to try again and maybe taste some of their bottles and explore the range of offerings they have - it's certainly diverse. TL;DR - this place deserves to be packed every night. One of my favorite meals in NYC thus far. Go.
Amazing.  First, I would like to take this moment to thank God for blessing me with such an amazing friend who suggested this place to me. [YOU DA REAL MVP MIKE D.!] #too #ble$$ed #way #up Now onto the review!  My foodie buddy and I ordered a Pork Belly Burger, Breakroom Fries, and $10 for 3tacos(Grilled Steak, Cheese Steak, & Fish Tempura). Everything, like I stated before, was amazing. Regardless of whether you're drunk, high, or neither, a fulfilling in-house eating experience is guaranteed. The food came out pretty fast, btw. The Pork Belly Burger was juicy, and flavorful. The ingredients went very well with each other. Loved the vibrant yellow color of the runny egg yolk. The juices of the burger did not drip with a sudden rush, but steadily. Uplifting.  Decided to take the recommendation of fellow Yelpers and ordered the well liked Breakroom Fries! Share this with your friend! For ~$7, you get a sexy aluminum tray of fries, and tater tots topped with a runny egg, drizzled with chipotle sauce, and garnished with Jalapeños. This, my friends, is what I like to call a work of art. Lmao what am I saying. #tryingtosoundlikeanartist #i #use #too #many #hashtags  Tacos($10 for 3):  Got the Fish Tempura, Cheese Steak, & Pork Belly. All were delicious and each were well worth the $10/3, which comes out to... I'm not even going to calculate it. Just no. I highly, highly recommend the Fish Tempura Taco(fish filet deep tried in batter topped with an avocado) no matter what. I promise that I'm not doing you wrong and you're doing your foodie self a favor. (;  Don't forget to buy yourself a drink, or else you'll get thirsty. My foodie buddy took ages to finish her Pork Belly Burger because she was thirsty as hell from all the overwhelming goodness. Breakroom does give free water, so just ask.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Prices are pretty decent and affordable, especially during Happy Hour($2 select tacos, $3 select beer--f*ck yeah!). Foodgasm guaranteed!
The matre d gave away our table for full party arriving a little late , so as punishment we get a corner table made for 2, however we were 3 people Food good , waitress good Bathroom was gross, disquesting!!!!
Really love the hand pulled noodles at Xi'an Famous Foods. The spinach dumplings were also really good. I asked for spicy but it wasn't that spicy, which is probably good anyway. It was just the right amount of flavor and spice. The only thing I will say is that the spicy lamb with cumin does not have a lot of lamb in it. I read the reviews about it and a lot of people said the same thing but I had to try it anyway.
They try hard, but the food falls pretty flat.  The poke bowl is quite small and the rice over cooked and mushy.  The short rib bowl also used the less than great rice.   I guess the was weirdly old people like.  The texture was super soft food with bland flavor.  Too bad.  I love new ideas. The waiter was great though.
I think this place is overhyped -- but it may just be this location, as I haven't tried the one in Chinatown.  We ordered both the pork and the crab soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, pan fried pork dumplings, and crispy spicy beef.  Pork soup dumplings: 3/5 The wraps for the xiao long baos were thick and quite dry, but the flavor was good. Crab soup dumplings: 2/5 The wraps were also very thick and dry, and the flavor wasn't great. I think it might be the mixture of the meats. Scallion pancakes: 1/5 The scallion pancakes didn't have scallions in them, which defeats the purpose of a scallion pancake in my opinion. It was also slightly overcooked. Pan fried pork dumplings: 3/5 Your average fried dumpling -- nothing special. Crispy spicy beef: 4/5 I think this was probably the best tasting dish out of everything we ordered. It's not very spicy, but the sauce is good.
Super super oily... Have to throw all the vegetable away. Because they are soaked in oil. Not healthy at all..
Um - so when I google 'quiet place to have a cocktail near Penn Station' and this place keeps yelping itself all over the place -- I take the chance.  Deafening, my friends, deafening.  I give it credit for being popular.  Good for you, Juniper. However, whomever thinks that a DJ spinning at top volume through a speaker right above our heads is quiet needs to sit down and listen to those decibels klang through their ears. What did I have to eat? What did I have to drink? In all honesty I couldn't remember if you showed me the menu again.  It was so loud, so stressful, and, so embarrassing to have booked this table with two colleagues whom I hadn't seen in months.  It simply wasn't our scene. It won't matter to the restaurant in any way, shape, or form because they will happily fill the table with mad happy-hour young 'uns in the vicinity and not miss me one bit.  I tried to post a video of the noise level but was unable to do so.
We were really excited to go to this place! The drinks we ordered were tasteless and both chicken dishes were very dry. We also ordered a salad that we did not like at all. We took one bite and called the waiter to request a replacement but he said we already ate some (how else would you try a dish?!) and charged us for it. In conclusion- just meh.....
Place was nice, but the service was a little slow and food was not the greatest. My food was dry and not too flavorful. I also felt not as attended to even as there were not a lot of people in the reataurant.
I've been to a lot of straight up legit tapas spots in my life. This place isn't one of them.  I always find that if you take an average place and create a brunch spot with liquor, with a bottomless mimosa/bloody mary situation you will have some inordinate number of New Yorkers 4 star yelp a joint.  I guess if you live in the area and this is your go to brunch spot/place to get hammered on a lazy Sunday afternoon then knock yourself out.  But generally speaking you do not want to be visiting uptown to get tapas, especially from this spot.
"What has two thumbs and no tastebuds? The Halal Guys, evidently.  I am actually ashamed that I wasted stomach space, while in Manhattan, on this. One star because it didn't make me sick, the cart smells amazing (which is obviously a misleading lie learned from the Gingerbread Hag in Hansel and Gretel) and did fill me up - technically meeting my basic human needs. But I'm not happy about it!  I ordered the chicken and beef gyro combo. I  am not a picky eater - ok maybe a little particular. But will try anything once and generally if there is at least flavour, I'm good to go. It angers me that these Halal Guy carts do so well and have garnered such a reputation because there is zero flavour in the meat. Shockingly so. Fairly certain a person who has never even stepped foot into a kitchen would know to flavour the food more than Halal Guys. The sauce, is basically ranch. But not even good ranch with peppercorn. More like a no name brand, basic bitch ranch used as a vehicle to moisten the flavourless meat because btw it's dry af. The bread (na'an) was alright, I guess. Nothing to write home about. As a whole, boring. The most vanilla, missionary of street meat.  In reading other reviews of Halal Guys, I've noticed people keep saying ""good halal"" - this makes me sad. Good halal exists but it is definitely not found at Halal Guys. If you're looking for good halal in the eastern North America area, visit Toronto, Montreal or Ottawa. I'm sure New York has a ton of quality spots, but not in the form of a food cart chain in one of the most touristic areas.  To the person that requested this to my friend prompting us to eat dinner here over a literal million other places, I feel sad that you have clearly never enjoyed a quality meal."
The food was amazing but the service gets a zero.. orders taken at the cash register, half of my order was handed to me (no tray)!! food items on the menu couldn't be swapped or changed (Lobster sandwich with a side) couldn't order an extra single sandwich had to be a meal.. no one checks if the food was good/bad, had to get out of my place to place extra order at the cashier.. finished my meal left and no one noticed me leaving...
I've been here twice and tried many dishes and all I can say is that the food isn't impressive. The greeting staff at the front desk gets 4/5, bar staff by waiting area receives 5/5 and our waiter receives a 4/5.  From my experience both times, make a reservation for sure and also don't go too early, you will still have to wait close to your reserved time ( I went an hour early both times and had to wait until my reserved time) For high end Asian food, I still prefer to go to TAO or Mr. Chows. Don't let me review deter you from going. I believe you should always try everyone restaurant twice (for the most part).
We came on a Friday night and it was full house. Peak hour is between 7pm to 730pm when wait time was about 1.5 hours. We arrived a little earlier so the wait was 50 minutes till we were seated. Food is pretty good! We ordered steak, mac n cheese and popcorn chicken. The first two taste very good, and the chicken is okay. I saw other people order their drinks in a zip-lock-like bag with light - pretty unique looking! Service is very friendly too. One star away from five star is because of the super long wait and the chicken did't wow us. I would recommend the restaurant for people want to try out new things with their friends!
The food is very spicy!!!  I asked for a cup of tap water and they refused! Pretty good food though.  There's a line and no room to sit. Luckily by the time we ordered our food we scavenged three seats for the party. There's relatively loud music but a generally ok atmosphere.  Overall, a good place ONLY for take out.
If you are looking for an amazing spit with live music, good food, and great beer selection; this is the place to go. The staff are courteous and thr owners are always around to make sure you have a great time. This is very little if anything downtown that compares to the quality of service, food, and atmosphere than suspenders.
I love this place for dinner. Food is different and interesting, staff are friendly, and prices are fair. The edamame dumplings (4pieces for $11) are always great but this time I was blown away by the eel taco  ($11 for 3 small tacos). So flavorful and surprising how eel guacamole cabbage just WORKS. I definitely recommend ordering it.  The gnocchi ($10) is also amazing but spicy for those who are sensitive. I want to try everything on the menu because nothing disappointed!  They are famous here for their glow in the dark Capri sun drinks which I didn't think were all too impressive. But the food is  come here for a casual but delicious weeknight dinner.
Another great cocktail bar in the Midtown West area. The decor is old-school elegant, the drinks are creative and the food is tasty. We started off at the bar and got a couple drinks. We then moved along to a table to order some finger food and cocktails. To eat we got the Pork Belly Tostadas, which were decidedly delicious, and the Thai Deviled Eggs, which were quite good as well. To drink we had the Astaire Sipper, Smoking Reverend, Hell is a Mild Climate and the Kinky Boots. All the drinks were well made and strong. A couple of minor gripes with the place - the service was a bit aloof and we needed to flag down our server every time we needed something. Also the vibe was on the quieter side with no music playing in the background. Good place overall to have a couple of cocktails and hang about.
"My boyfriend decided to surprise me with a reservation for Sunday brunch at The Smith, which I've wanted to try since I first started yelping and read about their famous mac & cheese! Never got a chance to bc 1. Price 2. Distance needed to travel (I'm lazy sorry). However, my experience here makes me want to eat here every single week! We had a reservation for 2 pm. It was a rainy gloomy day, so we expected the restaurant to be quite empty. Wow I was wrong; it was PACKED. People were even waiting outside in the rain. We arrived a bit early, so we had to wait 10 mins or so, but that's nothing compared to the other reviews that said they waited 40-60 mins. My first impression was that it was 1. Loud 2. Huge. We were led into the back area that you can't even see from the front, with a sky light and everything. We got good seats where the lighting was superb and didn't feel like we were talking over the table next to us. The service was impeccable; the waiter served us sparkling and distilled water right away, and recommended to us his favorite dish! We ordered: Prime burger- a fantastic burger that came with super crispy fries. My very picky and particular boyfriend described this as ""the fall of the Roman Empire"". If you're the type to get a burger at brunch, you won't be disappointed. Breakfast Pot Pie- a very delicious pot pie with two eggs on top. The yolk oozes, and the inside is steaming hot gravy with sausage, bacon, potatoes, peas and carrots. My boyfriend bet I wouldn't finish it. He lost the bet. This is really really REALLY delicious. It also comes with a free drink. I got the Bellini, which was just okay. But the cocktail did make the $18 price tag worth it (besides the amazing quality and taste of the food ofc) Mac and Cheese- tasted the way it looks- beautiful. This was the only thing that we didn't finish, so I took it home for breakfast the next day. It tastes even better than the day before! Mango cashew milk- my boyfriend loves mangoes so he decided to try this. Acquired taste, but def not bad once you get used to it. 5/5 would come again."
Great pasta! Black squid ink spaghetti was the best out of the 4 we tried. Pork trotter appetizer was prepared like a schnitzel and easy to eat.
2 eggs, hangar steak, homefries was $15. We did brunch here with a group because there wasn't a wait. Mimosas were weak and full of pulp, I was not a fan. For $12 I expected a little more. Home fries were good, steak needed SERIOUS seasoning and the eggs were just okay. The table would have greatly benefited from salt and pepper. With a table of six, we sat outside. The spacing between the tables is really awkward here. There was barely any space for the waitress to squeeze in between to get to other tables. She kept forgetting items from our order so this kind of prevented her from coming back in a timely matter. They didn't seem too busy so I don't really know what the holdup was. I will not be returning. With tip, eggs + small piece of steak and homefries + one mimosa was $32. Definitely not worth the stomachache it gave me. The only thing I appreciated was their patience regarding splitting the bill.
I absolutely die for Los Tacos. Those things are fucking amazing!! Needless to say, I was super excited to try Los Mariscos.  The interior is super cute and there was a much shorter line than for Los Tacos. Actually, there was no line at all! The spot is casual and very laid back.  We ordered the fish tacos and chips + guac. The fish tacos were surprisingly not crispy. How you gonna make a fish taco not crispy! IDK if it was an off day, if limp fish (sorry, ew) is their style or what but they lacked crisp. The guy at front also told me they weren't spicy at all but they definitely had a kick to them. Overall they were fine but not as good as what I would expect from the food legends behind Los Tacos.
I have not been here for awhile but found the prices went up & you get less food. I was totally disappointed.
Use to be a regular and now I'm really disappointed in their service team. The host sat us down quickly but then the waitress never came over. Waited about 15 min. She acknowledged the couple next to us twice and took their order but us not even once. We even waved her down but she went to the couple next to us again. Wasn't even busy at the time. Food is good but not worth being ignored.
So sad, I wanted to like this place so much. Came for the mac and cheese waffle and the NC BBQ, left hungry and unsatisfied.  Lexington style pork was alright but the East Carolina style pulled pork was not so great. Yes, Eastern style BBQ is supposed to be vinegary but it tasted like they just doused it in vinegar. the Mac and cheese waffle was dry and lukewarm. The only reason this place called 2 stars and not 1 was for the apple slaw. Arrogant swine has great outdoor seatings and beer selection. However, they are very lacking in the food. There is really no reason to trek all the way to Arrogant swine when there's so many delicious BBQ places in NYC now.
The experience here was truly bad. We went here for the first and last time last weekend because it looked like a great spot--intimate, filled with people, and homey. The service here was horrendous. The server showed an utter disregard for every customer. We were seated at a dirty table. It took 10 minutes for someone to come over with menus. I asked for regular coffee 3 times before I got it. The kicker was that, once presented with the mediocre and overpriced food, we asked the server 3 separate times over a period of 10 minutes for CUTLERY. That's right, we sat staring as our crappy food got cold because we couldn't even eat it due to a lack of utensils. We almost walked out.  We have also spoken with the manager which showed not care and on top of that was very condescending  It was evident from grumbling and frustrated sighs from other tables that everyone was a victim of poor service.  Don't waste your time
Made a reservation for lunch for four on Saturday September 9th at least a month in advance. Have been here many times before and always had a great experience and wonderful food. Unfortunately the young girl at reception desk was so rude and offputting that it actually ruined our entire experience. We had told our guests that we love this place and we're excited about them having a great time. I was upset that we were treated so badly by someone 1/2 my age being so condescending. She made us wait to be seated even though there were seven or eight empty tables, for no other reason that we could tell except to show us that since we were 15 min. late that she was going to give us a little punishment.  Our husbands were there on time but, she would not sit them until we were all there...hey I'm ok with that but, when we did arrive she rolled her eyes at us and said that they needed to settle up their bar bill before she would seat us...when we told her that we did she turned her back on us and said we would have to wait. Dear Lure...this girl does your establishment absolutely no service what so ever. There is no way people should spend money in an establishment when the first person that they see when they come in treats you so rudely....too many other restaurants where the service is better.
Don't order the bacon cheeseburger: the bun is stale and the texture of it feels like they pulled it out of the dumpster with the rest of the expired bread. Also, they gave me the burnt fries and less than half of what the people next to me got (who got fresh ones and an abundant amount). Overall, 2 stars because the service was cordial.
Just had a family dinner reunion there.  I had to bus my whole table because there wassn't a bus boy in sight,  Talked to woman in charge she just shrugged me off.  Caesar tasted like mayonnaise.  The only good thing was the dessert and cappuccino. There were almost 20 of us there.  Not worth the trip.  Iggy's pizza on 1st avenue in Manhattan serves a better Sicilian with cheese just rolling of your tongue. Not worth the money.  My husband agrees he's a chef!
"Came here around noon over the weekend with a group of 3. Had no issues getting a seat. Hostess was friendly and we sat at one of the picnic tables setup. We shared the table with another party of 3. One of the waiters was kind enough to bring my friend a chair so he didn't have to sit at the edge of the bench.  I decided to come here because NY Eater highly recommended their burger in addition to their lobster roll. I am a big fan of Luke's lobster so I felt obligated to try one of their competitors. For starters, we ordered the lobster mac and cheese. Nothing to write home about the mac and cheese. Nothing special with the cheese used. The top layer of the cheese wasn't a little crispy. The dish was basically just lobster thrown into the bottom and mac and cheese on top. I thought it would have been something different. Some parts of the dish still felt a little ""grainy"" (not from the lobster, but from the cheese). There bits and pieces of lobster in it but a dish as a whole, it wasn't impressive and I would not recommend it. For main course, we ordered the Hook Burger, Connecticut Lobster Roll, and Maine Lobster Roll. I actually liked the hook burger. It was seasoned well and used nice small pieces of pepper. You can actually taste a difference. Parts of the burger did come medium rare but about a 1/3 of the burger was medium. I may be wrong about this, the burger was juicy but it seemed there was some water content in it. It didn't taste like fat, but maybe I wasn't paying close enough attention. The buns were toasted but the side that was in contact with the tomato and lettuce, it was soggy. I would recommend them just putting it on the side and the customers can add it in. The fries were good. The pickle seemed a little strange to me. It was a little ""soggy"". It didn't have that nice crunch to it. Not sure if it's the style of this particular manufacturing company but it wasn't as appetizing. Both lobsters roll were excellent. I will just discuss the connecticut one because it is similar to Luke's lobster roll. In terms of freshness of the lobster meat, I would have to give it to Red Hook. In terms of correct ratio of amount of butter on it, I would give it to Luke's lobster. In my opinion, the Red Hook roll had too much butter on it and it detracted your taste buds from the meat itself. Both places gave similar amount of meat. Both places make great rolls, I just prefer Luke's. Actually, I prefer Red Eats in Maine, but that's too far away =D For drinks, we ordered the maine root beer.  I did not get a chance to ask which company root beer they use but I liked it a lot. It isn't as sweet as Bargs. I'm not sure what ingredients to use but I'm assuming they used some wintergreen and anise, amongst other ingredients. Nice balance to it and had a nice strong ""root"" taste. Overall, I would rate this place a solid 3.5 stars. Giving it 4 because you can't do 0.5 on yelp. Service was excellent. Our waiter was friendly and helpful. There was a mistake with how much each credit card was supposed to get charged but the issue was quickly resolved and our waiter was extremely polite and professional about it. I would recommend coming here. The motivation to come to this place was because I read an article about their burger on a reputable food website. I think their burger was good, but not excellent. When I come here again, I will stick with the lobster rolls."
One of the best steaks I've had. Ordered a Steak for Two medium rare and it was so beautiful.  The restaurant is kind of old so nothing spectacular about the ambiance. I'm not sure if this place is touristy or just for locals, but I'm glad our server was friendly since we were obviously visiting. I made a reservation about two weeks in advance and did not have any issues. I took the subway from Manhattan and was able to walk from the station to Peter Luger. They do not accept major credit cards. They only accept cash and their own Peter Luger credit card.
"Sorry, not authentic Italian. Way overpriced and not worth the pricing. Don't get fouled by white table clothes. Part of a discount hotel, that should have been the first sign to turn away. Service was very nice. Specials were many but please ask for pricing or get ready to overpay. We ordered one of the specials and was most expensive entree we paid for. Also the ""Chicken"" was frozen/pre made and as another Yelp review mentioned (and I agree) seemed from a dollar store (tasted like McDonald's) Watch for bottled water charges, not listed! We were charged $9 per bottle of Panna and we had 3, no wonder they were quick on the pour! Forgot, automatic service charge!?!?!? Sorry....only positive note, manager reversed service charge and I was allowed to tip accordingly. Not as special as many Yelp reviews claim it is or else they have never had real Italian meals."
"We didn't have a reservation (It was a Saturday afternoon) but they were able to seat us at the bar. Bartender was there, but not very attentive. The food was good- I had the baked eggs and my friend had the benedict with the pesto hollandaise. We also shared the nutella french toast, which had to be taken to go since we definitely over ordered. The really disappointing part was how long it took for our food to come. Not just food, but cappuccinos!! It must have taken at least 30 minutes for two CAPPUCCINOS. (meaning it took almost an hour for food) We kindly told the bartender that we were still waiting and ...""I know. It's coming"". Ten minutes later they arrive.  The restaurant was mildly busy, but coffee shouldn't take that long. And if it's that busy or you're short staffed, just check in with your customers! We can be understanding. And we were the only ones sitting at the bar at the time! Even though we enjoyed the food (though not sure if it was because we were starving when we got it), we were pretty annoyed that it took that long with no apologies or check ins. Probably will not be coming back."
Huge portion! We ordered lemon chicken, spaghettini with garlic, and clams in garlic were delicious! The two order was enough for five of us (adults). My brother is a very picky eater and ended up ordered another clams in garlic.  The ambience is very family oriented. Price is not that bad and the server was great.  If you craving Italian, this is not a bad place to go!
A must go! After 3 weeks of waiting for a reservation, I can say that L'Artusi did not disappoint. However, I'm not giving this restaurant 5 stars because I think the portions could've been a bit bigger, but I understand for the price and quality, portion sizes will not always be as generous as other Italian restaurants. I would recommend two pasta dishes to share and another appetizer if you're going with one other person. Here's what my friend and I got: Spaghetti The way they make the parmesan was crunchy and so delicious, a style I haven't tried before. While this dish was great, it felt a bit simple to me - which is fine since it is a classic but I wanted something that was more powerful and slightly richer.  Garganelli Probably my favorite dish of the two. The mushroom Ragu was tender and fragrant and complemented the dish extremely well - felt like it was melting in my mouth. The ricotta cheese on top was delightful but not too heavy. If you're a big fan of ragu and mushroom like I am, this is the dish to try! Book reservations early and enjoy!!!
I order the lobster roll and it was okay. Was expecting it to be phenomenal but it wasn't.   The fries and salad was good.  Doubt I'll go back
There are some interesting places here but the severe lack of seating is a major issue. Its also super crowded. Even standing spots were taken. I couldn't tell if the food was good because mine was cold by the time I ate it.  It's still under construction but it doesn't look like much seating. I'll update if I ever get a chance to come back.
Pro tip - don't order their ramen online. You get charged an extra $2 because apparently Yelp charges them a fee to have online ordering. You're better off calling them or just going in person to order. The ramen itself was not exceptional. The soup base was actually pretty tasty, although very salty, but the noodles were kind of hard and chewy (but not the good kind of chewy). It will do the job for a quick ramen fix-up because of its proximity to my office, but definitely would not seek it out if I had other ramen options. Disclaimer - I did have their ramen to-go, so it might be better if you eat in.
Food: 2.5 Drinks: 3 Service: 1 Ambiance: 3 Came here for dinner on a Sunday, as a group of 6.  We were seated at a table in the very back. We got the Spinach Salad, which was pretty good (vinaigrette, shallots, almonds, bleu cheese) but at $12 was way overpriced for a salad that didn't have any proteins in it.  The Pastrami Reuben was decent - flavorful and packed with lots of pastrami.  The accompanying kettle chips felt a bit like a throw away though.  Got an Old Fashioned for a drink, and it was decent. Others in our party had the fried artichokes (said they were good), the meatballs (looked like there were 3 meatballs in a lot of sauce, came with bread), the mussels (good sized portion), and one of the burgers. Service was not good.  One of our party ordered wine and it never came. He had to order it a second time before it was brought.  There was only one bottle of tap water for a table of 6 and we had to call someone over to get refills of our waters. Would not come back.
This is not a reflection of the waitress as she was ok. This is totally based on the food. It was horrible. First of all, the cutlery was dirty and the cutlery we than took from another table was equally dirty. We ordered a sandwich and the Cobb salad. The chicken in the salad was was gizzardy I couldn't eat it. It didn't even look like chicken. I tasted one piece and almost threw up. I get they are trying to be new age but I wanted a nice basic Cobb salad. Everyone single one of the ingredients in that salad was horrible. I would definitely never recommend this place and suggest they change the chef!
Had the Viet Wings, Fire chicken, 1/2 rack of jerk ribs, and Mac and Cheese. My favorite item was the wings and 1/2 rack of jerk ribs. Half rack of ribs is about 6 pieces. The sauce on the wings is very tasty. Overall the food is tasty but on bit expensive side. We had to wait  in line for 45 mins. Will come back to try the Bacon and Beef Ribs next time.  This place is 10 min walk from Steve's keylime pie and Valentino Park.
Asian Fusion is one of my favorite cuisines. This place did not disappoint! For lunch, we got: 1) Omurice with truffle fries (special item): Like a burrito, but wrapped in a perfectly fluffy egg. Inside, fried rice with with Asian flavors. You know those Korean food trucks that sell burritos? Omurice gives you the same satisfaction without the tortilla carb guilt.   2) Bulgogi tacos with truffle fries (yusss love them truffle fries): These were pretty good, but the sour cream was a little too heavy on the tacos and made them a bit soggy. Otherwise, the flavors in the bulgogi were great.  Clearly, we love our truffle fries (over the option of side salad). Perfectly crunchy with the right amount of truffle flavor.  I've also been to the Barn Joo at Union Square, but just for happy hour drinks. They have flavorful soju cocktails. The vibe at Union Square has more a HH, bumpin' vibe. This one was quieter - probably good for catching up and having a real lunch/dinner experience.
"update:  after speaking with someone from cecconis, i came back for a second chance and had an entirely different experience.  the food has improved ten fold, didn't try the calamari again but i venture to say it's much better. the front desk seemed to be running much more smoothly. i'm happy to say that they seem to have worked out the initial struggles and it shows in every aspect of what they're doing. would go back. would recommend. ----- oh lordy, where to begin.... i made my reservation for 9:45 for 6 people, we ended up being 2 (i guess i have no friends?) and got there around 8. we asked if there was any way they could accommodate us earlier, they kindly said they could seat us in ten minutes. fast forward, they did not seat us. every time we checked in they said ""oh sorry! one minute"" but  it wasn't until 9:50 we were seated.  To be clear, if they had said they couldn't accommodate us till our reservation time, that would have been FINE. but they did not say that.  once seated, we received one of the worst plates of calamari i have ever tried. like really terribly bad. i wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy bad. the waitress said she would remove it from the bill. the food besides that was totally decent. when the bill came, we asked for the under 27 discount we receive as soho members. they said it was applied but no itemized bill was included. when we got the bill it turns out they had not comped the calamari and had also added a cocktail by accident. not a good look to mess up the bill and not include the itemized receipt. all in all i will not be heading back anytime soon. the view is great but not worth 3 hours of annoyance. side note: all the servers were very friendly and courteous."
Nothing wrong with the food here! But expect to shiver and potentially develop hypothermia as management is adamant this place stays frosty. Your pleas for warmth will go unnoticed and, if you're lucky, outright ignored. I would advise walking out rather than dealing with the cavalier manager who has the insensitivity of a sociopath.
April 23, 2017 12:00 PM 4 Guests Maybe an off night? But, the worst Michelin star restaurant I have ever been to.  This is unfortunate, because I was visiting from LA, and we chose one 3 star restaurant after much research, we chose EMP. I wish I had tried per se instead. Super disappointed.  We did the tasting menu of their 12-or-14-whatever best items.  Some facts: Food was not served at appropriate temperatures consistently. Luke warm chicken, almost cold center? Bad chicken, regardless. (Substitute for a red meat dish for half of the table)  Needed a substitute for foie gras due to one of our diner's being pregnant. Substitute was uninspired beets cut into small squares. Beets vs foie gras...different playing field. If it were truffle something, or just something interesting and inspired, I would have appreciated the inclusion.  None of us thoroughly enjoyed a single tasting menu item! All of us were extremely disappointed and quite frankly hugely surprised.  So sad!!!! Really had high expectations for the best restaurant in the world. We keep telling ourselves: It must have been an off night?!
[500] I'm so glad this is my 500th review because we LOVED this place.  Found it via yelp reviews and it was close to our hotel.   So close to Broadway shows. We made reservations a few weeks in advance and glad we did because this place gets busy quick. The place is nicely decorated with plenty of room between tables. We never felted squished which we do at certain NYC restaurants. Carlos was our server and he was amazing.  He helped us with so many menu items (changing /splitting specials).   He was very friendly towards my son.  Answered tons of questions. Kid had chicken fingers and French fries.  It was so tasty.  You can see the chicken fingers were freshly made and no frozen crap. We had a caprese appetizer split in half and it was amazing.  You can taste the freshness in the cheese. We also had a dinner special split to have as an appetizer.  Saffron fettuccine.  Shrimp crab meat and cherry tomatoes. Loved it. Hubby's half had broccoli rabe.  You can taste the freshness of the pasta.  I ate every bite. I had jumbo shrimp w/ risotto in a wine sauce.  The shrimp were HUGE!!  I love every bite. I saved half for the hotel and ate it the same evening. We didn't have dessert since we were full. This is definitely our new NYC restaurant.     Hopefully they will join OpenTable one day :)  We will definitely be back.
Bigoted Staff/Environment. I don't want to give any stars. The pizza was okay, nothing special.  The meatballs were good. However, it was the service that turned me off.  I was there with non-white people, including my self, and quickly realized we were the ONLY non-white people. Okay, no biggie, but then the staff, including a woman of color, proceeded to treat my friends and I as an inconvenience from the moment they sat us.  Not to sound like a nut but one of my guests and I noticed the waitress instructing the bus boy about our table and from that point f was all rushed rude service.  I watched other tables be allowed to take the time while our table was repetitively asked if we wanted anything else while we were eating.   The whole experience left me feeling down, angry and like I had just paid people to treat me bad.
Cute decor, friendly staff.  Takes reservations which was great.  Saw all the good reviews and came by.  Food was tasty. Very small portions! Im not a big portions person, was shocked with the amount of pasta you received with each dish considering the price.  Hence three stars.
"These spots are opening up like mushrooms all over the city. Here's my opinion. Spinach dumplings: tasty, and huge; no need to put so much oil, though. Pork burger: tasty, but nothing to rave about. Pork noodles: the best dish I got; I found them to be delicious. Lamb: not bad, even though be aware that it WILL be greasy. A lot. Oxtail: I know there's not much meat around the bones, but this oxtail is really stingy; won't order it again. Overall, I think they have decent dishes for the price they charge (some pretty good), but I'm not in love with the place like everybody else. I find confusing that they tell you everywhere NOT to take out their food bc it ""loses flavor"", yet they don't make ANY effort to add decent seating in their locations. Come on, people, really?!"
Man, I really wanted to like this place... Having just come back from Japan a couple of weeks ago, I was having some really strong ramen cravings.  Unfortunately they were out of tonkatsu (pork) broth when I went at 8pm. All they had was chicken broth. I was a little skeptical because chicken ramen is harder to get right and I've not had a good bowl of chicken ramen in the US, ever. It's usually less flavourful, less umami, less rich unless you do it really well. But what the heck, I gave the miso broth a try. Sigh, I was right. Like many of the reviewers have said, the chicken broth did not have much flavor, was too salty and pretty thin even for chicken. The noodles reminded me of instant noodles out of a packet.. Luckily, boyfriend had the Kuu Chili, which added somewhat more flavor to the noodles.  All in all, quite disappointed. I will be back one last time to give the pork broth a try. I guess I'm not that surprised, chicken in the US in general sucks. How are you expected to get flavor out of meat that has no flavor? Edit: The crispy squid legs were pretty nice, but the pieces were varying in freshness.
We tried stopping by one Friday evening and were super turned off by the quoted three hour wait time. Thankfully, the next time we returned on a Monday right around opening time, our party of two was able to be quickly seated.  Their menu is simple and concise, but will definitely have something for everyone in the group! We were recommended 2-3 tapas per person, but we decided to split three between the two of us. It was plenty! We ordered the seafood paella, the kimchi gnocchi, and the steak with grits and kale. Of course, we also had to order their 'special', the adult Capri Sun. Everything was fantastic!  My favorite was the kimchi gnocchi. This dish screams Korean fusion, and represents it well. I loved the sauce so much I ended up eating it over the rice that came with the seafood paella. Next time, I'll remember order a side of rice or something to sop up all of that delicious sauce with! The seafood paella is less of a 'fried rice' with a more porridgy base. If you are okay with that, I think you will really enjoy the flavors of the paella. It is definitely not paella in the traditional sense, but is constructed similarly. Finally, the steak was also a star. It was cooked medium rare and bursting with the flavors of their special steak sauce. It went well with the kale and grit sides which helped to tone down the flavors a tad bit. I'd say everything was a bit on the saltier side, but nothing inedibly so. In terms of price, they are comparable to the typical tapas place. Cocktails and other alcoholic beverages are also reasonably priced for NYC standards. I think our entire meal probably cost around 60 for two including tax and tip. Service is friendly and the staff was very good with recommendations! I wish they would figure out a way to accommodate all of their customers, or perhaps establish a protocol for reservations/waitlists that is less chaotic.
Great food with a nice atmosphere. I went here the first time I visited the city and came again my second time. I'll probably come during each visit! MMMMMmmmMmm
It would be a five star if it wasn't for a simple mistake. I like the look the feel and the vibe. You walk in your brought back in time to the gold on Jazz days! The people and the waiter was super! She was supper friendly and a nice company to be served by. Being a restaurant week I the city.. (Not Staten Island) it was nice they had a pre-fixed menu.. I was gonna do something other but kept it easy with the budget and it grabbed me to order. The drinks are great.. You must try their cocktails! I orders a Cesar salad.. And their soup.. The salad came with bacon.. People who know me know I stopped with pork ages ago, I asked them if it's possible to get it with out bacon.. She said sure.. Came back with another Salad.. And it literally looked and felt like they pulled out the bacon and reserved it.. I knew and confirmed that when i found the bits in the salad. I'm sorry I didn't know there was bacon.. But you should be sorry to reserve that to me after that.. I realized customizing isn't an option here. I did change any order and only ordered by their many! The entree wet superb.. The desert was amazingly delightful! Will come back of course.. But I will make sure I read and order correctly and make sure I don't customize any dishes. Hopefully you would consider that tip also! Happy eatings!
The bargain lunch is no longer a great bargain, as some of the entrees cost as much as $13, but it is still a good deal on many dishes, such as the bun and pho.
The hype is untrustworthy. To me, Momofuku should be the best marketing business not the best ramen restaurant. I really feel I wasted my money here. The ONLY thing I enjoyed was the water that they constantly refilled for me. Everything was soooo salty that covered any other flavor. Of course, you may feel I couldn't take a little bit salt, but when my friends and I all said that, I believe I'm not the problem.  Pork bun is good though, but $12 for 2 pieces, plus other unsatisfied dishes, I really regret to give a try today.  To sum up, I WON'T come back and recommend anyone to try, either.
Top notch hole-in-the-wall Chinese food. The hand-pulled noodles are perfectly springy and chewy and the dumplings are juicy and flavorful! This tiny restaurant only has a few stools and 2 large round tables for seating, so go during off-peak times or be prepared to wait a little. Luckily they serve the food super quickly and people seem to eat and go relatively quickly... not a ton of lingering or lounging here. At the rear, you can see workers hand-making pork dumplings (which you can order pan-fried or boiled). Douse the dumplings in Lam Zhou's hot chili oil if you like spice, and you're good to go. Prices are pretty reasonable.  This is a must-stop for noodle lovers who want an affordable, fast, and delicious meal!
This is my very first post EVER on YELP.  I've been a closet reader for years, but never have taken the time to actually review. However, after the experience we encountered at PURE BIRD in Park Slope, we felt it would be a major disservice to others not to inform others of this establishment. These folks are the lowest of the LOW!  The folks at Pure Bird outright discriminated against my wife and I. And to make matters worse, they failed to issue a credit to our credit card after we rejected the food and called them out on it. Let me repeat that... we were DISCRIMINATED against... AND they took our money. After this incident happened, we made several attempts to contact the owner, CHRISTINA L, and she has failed to contact us back which says A LOT about the business owner she is. We ended up contacting the BBB and the ACLU to report them. EFREN and ANDY two of the flamboyant cashiers are as nasty, rude and inconsiderate as can be. It truly baffles me that folks can get away with this. WHO does this? WHO treats customers in this manner in 2015? PURE BIRD does. Stay FAR, FAR away from this place at all cost.
Came here for lunch on a rainy weekday and the place was only half-filled. Perhaps it was the rain that deterred the crowd, or because we had a late lunch around 1.30pm. The menu is fairly simple - there are only three rolls to choose from (lobster/crab/shrimp) or you can opt for the Luke's trio where you get  1/2 each of the lobster, crab and shrimp rolls. You can also add 2 sides to a roll for $3. We each had a lobster roll and shared the slaw and chips. The first time I tried Luke's Lobster was at the Theater District and I thought it was just ok. I have a better impression of the lobster rolls at this FiDi location. The bun was buttered and toasted perfectly, there was a generous amount of fresh lobster and there was just the right amount of seasoning on the lobster. However, I'd say skip the combo and just have the lobster roll, then go elsewhere for desserts ;)
Food was great, but service was just okay. The terrible manager came back to us demanding that we pay a higher tip. That really messed up the whole evening and great food. Like seriously !!!! TIPS Are a Reward for great service not an ENTITELMENT.
"Well, this is a really tough review for me. Tough because I cannot decide between a 4 and a 5. I just kept energizer bunny'ing this place (eating and eating and eating). If someone doesn't get that reference feel free to stop reading anything I write you might be too young. I would do my normal breakdown by each individual item, but this place has produced the best single bite of any place in new york and here is a replay on how that all went down: Quarter piece of the cheddar waffle, fried chicken, spicy sauce, bourbon syrup, mac n cheese and a little bit of ribs. O to the M to the G this place took my taste buds on a journey any tongue would be jealous of.  Waffle isn't too dense with delicious cheddar on top for sweet and savory delight. Chicken is so juicy and has all the essential spices (and essential oils I guess). Mac N cheese is well baked, with just enough ooey gooey cheese the make you feel at home. The ribs added a little back country flare. And last but not least the spicy sauce gave it an awesome kick and the syrup cooled your mouth down right after. Each part alone was delicious each part together, unstoppable. Also, had some cole slaw which had a great amount of ginger to take you far east, and some desserts; key lime pie, which was the right color and the right tartness. Donuts and coffee... which is a misnomer... donuts and coffee ice cream. Tasted like a churro with a little more fluff. The perfect end to a perfect first day. THE VERDICT: I still don't know what to give it!! I haven't given a five star in a while because they are so sacred and feel like people have higher expectations of places I give five stars. (That's my ego talking). However, I can get around the ""as good as it gets"" because it might just be as good as it gets for a combination bite. Best bite I may have ever had in my vida. Alright... I am pulling this trigger on this one... going 5. Although you already know that because it says it up above.. Spoiler alert. Trust me writing this end was way more exciting than reading it. But seriously, I loved this place and it deserves its place in the sun."
The green curry was good but not good. It is not traditional Thai. There was too much fish sauce in everything I tried. I can't blame this place but I got sick after eating it. Hopefully I can try this place again.
What a great experience! We went there with 4 more couple and ordered almost the entire menu and everything was just delicious
It was a decent meal.  Great service and wine, but the food was good, not great.  Note, we came for dinner.
I always get my food to-go and I love it every, single time. I am partial to the Jim Cade Burger with sweet potato fries & the bacon potato salad. I mysteriously got a piece of cake included in my bag...and gladly ate it. Filling and good size portions; I can't complain.  Suggestion: Make sure your check is the right amount, it gets crowded/busy in there so it can get chaotic...I did have to get money back from the server that was closing out my check because she calculated wrong.
This is one of my favorite places to go to for happy hour with the girls! The $12 wine flights are amazing! Plus there are at least six different variations of flights that you can get, so they never get old. And you're usually allowed to do some mixing with your choices to. They are $16 at regular price, which is still a good deal. I have only ever had food here once (last night), and it was pretty good! We just stuck to some lighter snacks, but everything we had was good.  This could be a good date spot (I definitely stood next to a first date as I was leaving... those conversations are recognizable anywhere). Pro tips: #1 Make reservations or get there early for happy hour. They get very packed. Especially when NYU students are feeling fancy.  #2 Happy hour is on Saturdays too.
"Not just your boring, everyday ""Mr."" Smith for breakfast! * GET - Any of their lattes = yum! * GET - Avocado Toasts with Poached Egg = perfectly melty-poached egg, atop plenty of tasty avocado and choice of bread * YES - Warm interiors: L-shaped restaurant, tile walls, minimal modern décor, bench or table seating * YES - Large extensive menu * YES - Friendly service * YES - Plenty of seating for breakfast hours * FYI - Accepts reservations * FYI - Accepts credit card Recommend~"
Poor service, rude personnel and misleading wait lines.  This is NYC, you have many other options rather than waiting for this mediocre fake ' Greek ' place.
Maybe I'm biased because the space immediately appealed to me due to its high ceilings & sophisticated interior design but I was definitely floored upon entering this chic Asian Fusion eatery. And not to mention, I celebrated my unforgettable 28th birthday here. The server seemed like an actor in a funny play, so he was certainly entertaining and adept at memorizing orders. In other words, excellent service. I think aside from all this, I was very impressed by the food. My goodness! They offered everything from land and sea. Our crab fried rice was served in a crab shell! That was one of my favorite dishes next to the fish and the shrimp dumplings. I don't think you can go wrong with anything. As long as you don't have any dietary restrictions, I would encourage trying a little bit of everything. This place is great for large groups considering it is family style dining. In the end, I was surprised to have a birthday tart oozing with chocolatey goodness. Couldn't have asked for a better place to celebrate my birthday :)
If you want to wait over an hour for a burger for lunch when they're only half full come here! There's just no reason for it. Plain and simple.
On Wednesdays the happy hour is all night at the bar. The also have $7 mussels and sausage that are great (A happy hour deal). You can't come here and not get mac and cheese, so don't miss out. The chicken and waffle are delicious too. The waiters and bar tenders are attentive and friendly. The hostess, not so much.
We went to Mom's this week for their opening day, and it was quite good despite some opening-day snafus. But, that, of course, was to be expected since we were hitting up this spot on their first day of business. SERVICE: The VERY best I've had in some time! The young man who handled our table was fun, on the ball, and very attentive! I forget his name now, but when I return, I'll be sure to ask and add it to my review. DRINKS: They have some big ass drinks, and they are cheap! The margarita was a bit sweet to me, but everything else was spot on... and, did I say HUGE!! FOOD: Mom's features southern cuisine, and everything we tried was great. We had a table of 6 and were able to try quite a bit of the menu. We had the wings, cheese curds, mushrooms, fried chicken sandwich, shrimp and grits, pork benedict, chicken and waffles, and mac & cheese pancakes. All were super tasty! Some of the food came out lukewarm, but we understood that the chefs were still working out the kinks, so we were forgiving (and everything was tasty, which made up for it).
"The interior has cute, rustic feel to it and the food was just generic brunch taste that most brunch places have in NYC. (I have yet to find a good brunch place, a place that can show me why people are so into brunches.) Now, why a two. Originally I thought of 3, but thinking of the service, I saw that 3 star means okay--and I was definitely not okay with the service. I mean.. everything aside, I just have one thing to say: if you almost drop a knife near my body, the least you can say is sorry. I mean, I think that is not service but a basic human to human thing, whether you know the person or not at a table. The knife did not drop on my lap but near the edge of the table, right in front of me as the person was gettig a plate that was across me. I sat there, of course surprised, but the person just picked up the knife and left. As if nothing happened. I was not angry then but was baffled that someone just dropped a knife, of course by accident but still--I would have apologized if a freakin' knife dropped near me, right in front me, near my lap or wherever.. Anyway.. yeah, not coming back.  Still alot people, so if people who want to go, note that there are a lot of people and may be a long line. Brunch is the same, nothing outstanding compared to other places in NY, and design or atmosphere is cool. But I wouldn't expect great service here. Too busy and the staff are too ""casual"", very loosely speaking."
Cute, intimate restaurant on the upper east side. Food never disappoints and has a great wine selection. The pappardelle pasta dish was one of the best I've ever had.
Try it if you are craving hotpot and in the area. Pros: host was really nice, staff was friendly too.  The atmosphere was pretty good with classy decorations.   Cons: limited selections of food.  Ingredients aren't the freshest.  Doesn't have beer license yet.  Usually a waitlist after 6pm. Not the best nor the worst all you can eat hot pot, with 22 pp price tag, worth a try if you are in the area, hungry and craving hot pot. A
They kept me waiting for half an hour for my food and then they said there was a mix up in the kitchen because of shift change. after another 10 minutes they asked if I have had my taco which I never got. Then they said they actually don't have what I ordered. It was just ridiculous.
I have been making udon all my life and here is my review: No offense to the chefs, investors, or owner of this restaurant, but when you put certain food on the menu or make changes to a dish, you should consider the dire consequences of this change. The shrimp tempura did not represent what I saw on the menu. Overall, the shrimp tempura udon looked and tasted like a dish with reckless decisions-- if you're replacing small shrimps for long shrimp as the shrimp tempura, tell your customers so they are aware. If you're battering and frying a crumble of sliced onions and green peppers and calling them vegetable tempura , tell your customers. Because Japanese shrimp tempura is not what Udon West served and it's a disgrace to the country's cultural noodle soup. Let's be honest, no one likes spending money on food that costs 5x the amount it takes for them to make at home, and more disgustingly not when eating the shrimp Udon prepared by Udon West. The quality was unacceptable. (Not to mention that the fish cake was extremely salty)
My expectations were too high. I've heard such great things about this place and have been wanting to go for a long time so I went in expecting the best thai food I've ever had. I don't know if it was the rainy night outside or the smell of cleaning product when we walked in or the crowded space or the shit I saw in the toilet that someone forgot to flush when I went to the bathroom that made me feel like this place was not the cleanest. But I lost my appetite and excitement to try this food right away.  In any case, we ordered crispy calamari, fried crab/chicken dumplings, curry puffs, and Tom Kha Gai soup to start. Best thing was the calamari and everything else was just ok. I longed for the curry puffs from our neighborhood thai place instead of these overly doughy not flavorful ones. Husband got the cornish hen platter, which can be served bone in or boneless. It was pretty good and came with coconut sticky rice and some veggie slaw. I ordered the pad see yew with chicken and it was on par with my lunch special place in the city - good but not spectacular.  Glad we finally made the drive over to try this place but I probably won't be back.  Note: Cash Only
Their padthai is for Americans not for people from Asian. The only thing I could taste with their padthai is SWEET which is totally not authentic Thai at all. Not recommended their food if u are from Asian countries. But the service was really good and restaurant decoration was very pleasing.
Now they've started taking reservations designated for outdoors it seems to actually be less efficient. When we first went you couldn't reserve the outdoors and we got seated in 20 minutes. We arrived early for a reservation this time and was seated 45 minutes after our reservation time outside. Learned that they do not monitor the 90 minute limit for parties of two. I think the issue is if they would have told us when we checked in it would've been 45 minutes we might have made a different decision. They told us 20 minutes so we had a drink and a bite at the bar.   Other than the long wait the service was excellent and we really enjoyed the food particularly the salmon. Out of the special veal dish by 730 which we would've had.  Special mention to Nigel who explained what was going on. Big place. Small kitchen. Nice evening with people lingering. Seemed he cared and tried to make it up to us.
Waited for 1 hour for a table for a party of 4, to only then been told that because one person was missing from our party when we first get there, we were back at the back of the line.  Went to Barnes Joo on the other side of Broadway and in 5 minutes the found a place for us, and had some great food and cocktails. Also, 14 $ for a glass of site done at the bar is ridiculous, even for Manhattan.
I'd rather eat in a dumpster than deal with the hostess here. Thanks for ruining my birthday dinner. Or lack of a dinner.
Wow, you get bang for your buck here. The hot pot is a massive portion of food. Watermelon soju was great altho seems a lil weak? being the alcohol lover that I am, we ordered a bottle of soju and poured that into our second watermelon of the night. Also had the clam & leek pancake which was deeeeelicious. 2 gripes which dropped my rating a bit. 1) They were out of the live octopus. I mean dubya tee eff, the sole reason I came here was to overcome my gag reflex and eat some squiggly octopus. We were there early in the evening too. We had them call their other location because we were gonna head over there and guess what, they were out of it too. Fail. 2) They leave the hot pot on the super lava molten magma setting. Meaning if you don't eat everything in the first 2 minutes of it being cooked, it gets overcooked (which is particularly an issue when it comes to seafood!). Literally by the end of the meal there was a slight burning smell coming from our pot. Obviously I'd have them do something about this in the future, but as a first timer it didn't occur to me and they should realize that boiling your food nonstop isn't a good cooking practice.  Think I'd stick to normal chinese hot pot over this, but as mentioned, I came for the live octopus.   Good place for a big group and they have a lil buzzer on your table to ring your server too which is handy.   Was looking forward to but did not get to try the fried rice made in the hot pot leftovers which sounds awesome, we were too stuffed (came with 7 people and still a ton of food).  Then again would only have done it if the remaining portion wasn't super overcooked.
This place looks nice but the drink and food selection is by far sub par. This street has way too many other places with better food. It's like they are specifically trying to not have Korean menu items.
Disappointed tonight. Egg custard is no longer included in a set menu. Miso soup and tea is not hot. I can put my fingers and stay. Too much veggies comparing to the amount of dressing I get. I saw some garbage bags and disorganized storage space with a microwave between bathrooms and a drink counter. The stuff yell each other in the kitchen in front of a counter which is really annoying. I went there on a sunny warm late Saturday night but empty... I still like this place but this place needs lots of improvement to keep business going and repeaters coming back. I have been a repeater but they can improve the menu too.  I wanna eat something else.
For all their farm to table nonsense, you'd at least hope for some consistency or follow through. Using PAM for the pancakes and other dishes is unacceptable.
Cash only, $3.50 for tea no refills, small pizza is $21.50 and a LOCAL BEER IS $8 a pint LOCAL!!? and the waitress over charged us $16 on drinks but we caught before we paid.
My family and i went to eat and our bill came out to around 300$, the waitress forgot to bring some of our food and we had to wait to eat and also messed up our orders they never came to check on us and ignored us when we asked for service, even tho it wasnt busy we paid and didnt care much for the service or food we just tried to have a good night but what was awful was that at the end of the night the waitress asked us if the food and service was good and we all said yes to not make a big deal out of it but later she complained about how much money we left for tips and asked us to leave i dont recommend this restaurant and will never go back the service is horrible and i recommend going to Tacos el Bronco on 43 St and 4 Ave
Mediocre burger, mediocre pizza, and mediocre service. I was so excited to try this place, but it was a let down. The burger was super soggy and could not enjoy it and poorly proportioned-- too much meat and toppings for the bread to hold. The pizza was also incredible bland and very cold when it came to us. Ironically, the only thing I enjoyed was their brussel sprout salad (which is why I am giving it 2 stars and not 1)--but it was not wow at all. Our server was also not helpful or knowledgeable when it came to the menu and providing suggestions.
We dined here on Sunday night for my brother's birthday.  It's not always easy snagging a reservation places for a party of 7, but The Smith was able to accommodate us the same day.  I've previously dined at the Lincoln Square location, but this was my first time here.  The setup and decor is basically identical to the other location with the exception of the layout.  There are small round tables with rounded chairs for your dining convenience.  Not the most comfortable, but it served the purpose.  I feel that they kind of pack you in like a can of sardines, the other tables are right on top of you, not much room to move around. The service was very good.  Our waiter was attentive, continuously refilling the bottles of regular and sparkling water on the table, and provided us with more bread and butter.  The prices are a bit high, but it is in the heart of NYC, so that's to be expected.  The portion sizes are what I would consider small.  Both my mother and I finished our meals, and we never do that!  So, that just goes to show that it is a smaller portion.  But it was enough for me to eat.  Don't dine here with the expectation of having leftovers, because you won't have any.  The food was flavorful and presented nicely.  All of our meals were good with the exception of my father's Pork Chop.  It was overcooked.  Our waiter took it back and made him a new one, which was cooked perfectly.  The other problem was that everyone else was already done eating by the time his food came. I would go back if I'm in the area again.
Came for Father's Day. They don't make reservations for parties smaller than 8- so we came EARLY to avoid waiting. CASH ONLY. My Dad wanted Malaysian for Father's Day- which is surprisingly scarce in NYC. We ordered 6 or 7 dishes, all of which were delicious. I'm not well versed on Malay food so I didn't have any expectations. But everything was satisfying, generously portioned, and appropriately priced. Thumbs up!
I had the BBQ meatloaf with Mac & cheese with collard greens. Majority of my plate was collard greens with one small scoop of mac & cheese with a big chunk of meatloaf. The meatloaf is absolutely disgusting!! It was just a big pile of mush with too much peppers and onions, where's the flavor? It was the consistency of baby food. Yuck. My boyfriend had the southern chicken with mashed potatoes and Mac & cheese. The mashed potatoes were gross as well. The potatoes tasted weird, it was like mashed potatoes with cinnamon and garlic. I'm giving two stars because the Mac & cheese and collard greens were good. - the restaurant had guests who were obnoxiously loud, & they were not told to lower their tone. I couldn't even hear what my boyfriend was saying across the table.
My husband and I went in for lunch today. We had kimchi, pork veg. steamed dumplings and #2 House Special Noodle soup. We split it all. The food was really fresh and delicious! When we walked in we were seated right away and the food came very quickly.  The tea served was very good as well.  The only downside is that the place is small so our table was small and could barely fit our food and drinks.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant!
I came here with a very large group for a business dinner.  We had a ton of food and pretty much everything was good.  Our waitress really took care of us even though the place was busy.  We did wait about 20 minutes for a table when we had a reservation but they took care of us as quickly as they could. They serve family style dishes so we tried a bunch of different items.  Everything was delicious.  Not one bad thing. Carmine's Salad Hot Antipasto Chicken Marsala Veal Saltimbocca Shrimp Fra Diavolo Eggplant Parmigiana Meatballs Tiramisu You definitely want to make a reservation or you may wait for a long time as the place was packed.  Good service, good food.  Old school Italian family style.
They are actually closed for the middle of the day so it would be great if the yelp page was updated to reflect that. Just walked all the way there to find it was closed. Bummer!
I hate to say negative things about this spot but I wasn't impressed. The server (as sweet as he was) got our order wrong, took forever and never bought out our drinks! I was so disappointed. The food was ok. I've had better but it wasn't bad. It would have nice to get what we actually ordered though.
The service was kind of terrible - I wasn't asked if I had a reservation and the table right by the main door? Not the best seat in the house. Actually, if your chair is in front of the wooden counter, expect to sit uncomfortably the entire time, because the wooden counter sticks out just enough to hit your neck, when you attempt to lean backwards. Do not sit there.  The pasta though? GOODNESS. I got the beet papperdelle and it was just amazing with the rabbit ragu. I almost forgot about the wooden shelf hitting my neck while I ate my main course. The beets though (as an app) are a skip dish - there's literally nothing to it, just plain old beets. However, I'd definitely order the marinated mushrooms and avocado artichoke toast again.  Unfortunately when I was there, they hadn't secured their alcohol license. The bathroom upstairs is nice, the one downstairs is kind of a dump.  Don't bother making a reservation, as it doesn't seem to matter. If I had to rate the meal by itself, I'd give the food (sans the beets) a 4-star rating.
Loved all the food we got! They came in huge servings so we ended up taking half of our orders home. Value for money was ! The place was packed despite getting in there at 130pm. Servers were really cool and checked up on us each time.  Ps. Cuban sandwich was the best we've had ever! Make sure to grab one when you get your chance
"Good but not memorable.  Server became noticeably disappointed when we decided on apps, no entrees. The BBQ is fine, but I've had better at numerous spots in Brooklyn.  The ""meat candy"" should be relabeled ""brisket in sugar sauce.""  It's good but nothing out of the ordinary."
Not the most economical sandwich, but well worth the price.  Perfect sized portions of absolutely amazing seafood.   Some will lament that the sandwiches are small, but they are rich and tasty.  In my opinion, a marvelous lunch.
I would probably give this place one star but the customer service was excellent. As far as the pizza is concerned, i felt it was average at best and paying 30 dollars a pie is insane. I don't know how this place has such great reviews. I usually don't take the time to write reviews but i feel that i should be doing a disservice to the people in pursuit of great pizza.
I gave in to the hype. This udon restaurant is conveniently located in Union Square. When I arrived for my Friday 7PM reservation I heard the wait was already 1.5 hours. I am glad I was able to make reservations through the Resy app because I do not think this restaurant warrants such a long wait. Their udon bowls come in two sizes - regular or large for the same price, the difference is the amount of noodles you receive. The fat kid in us opted for the large bowl. Between the two of us we ordered the salmon garlic appetizer, two bowls of udon - the sukiyaki and curry deluxe and two Kirin's. My favorite udon spot of all time is Marugame Monzo in LA where you can taste the bounce of freshness in each strand of noodle. In NY, I recommend Raku's udon noodles over Tsurutonton. Overall 3 stars, I have had much better meals for $120.   I highly recommend ordering 1 large bowl of udon to share between two people and sharing a bunch of apps.
"Large family-style portions, friendly service, open kitchen, casual yet modern, are a few ways to describe Momofuku Ssam Bar. This Asian fusion restaurant hits every spot to entice a millennial foodie like me to come here.  I came here with three friends for the Duck Ssam, which we made a reservation for beforehand. Shortly after we sat down, the staff brought out the duck for us to take pictures before it gets sliced up. This is very commonly done in Chinese restaurants when you order Peking Duck. The staff will also describe to you how the duck is prepped and cooked. It's stuffed with a duck and pork sausage and served with some herbs, lettuce and rice. It also comes with duck confit legs, chive pancakes and a variety of sauces including a duck-fat ginger scallion sauce, Korean-style barbecue sauce, and hoi sin sauce. You also have a choice of two seasonal sides - we went with the broccoli salad and pickles.  Ssam in Korean means ""wrapped"" so you would eat the duck pieces wrapped in lettuce with the herbs and the sauces they give you. It's basically a Chinese and Korean meal combined into one! My favorite combination to eat the duck ssam is with hoisin and korean barbecue sauce, and some watercress and herbs. However, I felt that the overall course could be more refined. Duck has a very distinct taste but it didn't really shine through in the dish. The pork and duck sausage was flavorful but I felt that it overpowered the taste of the duck. The best part about duck is the skin when it's flavorful and crispy, but I felt that the skin of the rotisserie duck could be a little more crispier, which takes skill to create as I've seen my dad make rotisserie duck at home. Overall, even though I had higher expectations, I still had a pretty fun dining experience. I was stuffed and content by the end of the meal and I'd definitely come back and try the other Ssam meals!"
Relatively new spot on 8ave that a lot of my friends have been going here to try out since it's suppose to be the local fresh sushi and food spot. So PROS: Good service- they were really nice and our server did a good job at just going ahead explaining thoroughly about the specials and recommending what's good. Food- I actually really love their yakitoris! My boyfriend loved how the lamb&pork belly tasted as I thought the bacon enoki was grilled perfectly... We may actually think it's better than the ones in St.Marks and all of 8ave skewer spots, but go when they have it for $1(mon&tues) cause it's normally $5 here! CONS: They ran out on one of my fave sashimis, sweet shrimp & live uni. So we ought to get the regular uni from Cali and Japanese uni, which of course the Japanese one is more expensive and tastes sweeter but their regular uni did not melt in your mouth whatsoever, also leaving the briney taste on your tongue... That is not fresh uni. The next crazy thing, we asked for was two piece of toro(tuna fatty belly) and they brought it to us seared... Who on earth ever sears such great delicate Kobe piece of the sea? Toro must be eaten raw. So we sent that back, few minutes later he said they're all out on toro, automatically we knew they had to do a bogus move by searing it because the toro didn't look or tasted fresh at all. Then the live scallop, it wasn't decent sized chunk of scallops but very thinly sliced which is actually not the way I prefer it. Also their pricing is priced pretty weird and off, really expensive for certain things. I love white tuna, which didn't fail nor did their foie gras. Everything else was pretty good or ok, nothing to really run home about. Maybe their sashimi wasn't fresh because I did go on an off day(Monday) for dinner and I'm still actually willing to give this spot a second chance for their sushi but I'd defiantly would come by on their $1 special yakitori just to dine in and have that haha!
One of the tastiest and most unique ramen places I've been to in NYC, but also the priciest. I think overall its worth the try. Not an everyday casual ramen shop though. The restaurant is small, with a big communal table in the middle and a handful of seats at the bar. Expect a wait at prime meal times.  Service was very attentive and they made sure to explain their dishes/specialties/what they were most popular for.  There were several things I wanted to try but it was too pricey to get everything. I ended up getting the mu ramen and my friend and I split the foie gras stuffed chicken. The mu ramen is bone marrow and oxtail broth based, topped with corned beef. Very rich and creamy. Not the best choice if you want something light. But I thought this was the most unique ramen broth I've ever had. The portion was on the smaller side but still filling enough. The foie gras chicken came out freshly deep fried, with a light dusting of flour on the outside, which formed a nice light crust. The chicken was extremely moist and juicy. The foie gras on the inside added to the richness. A bit of it seemed undercooked/just slightly cooked so I didn't eat that part and would definitely point it out next time if it happened again.  Overall very indulgent meal and I walked away satisfied. I would go back to try the uni and their other more traditional ramen.
Not sure why Momo has so many high reviews, the food was average at best.  Uni Pasta: Good, but after a few bites extremely heavy and unbearable to finish it. Sushi: Not super fresh or high quality.  Chicken Karage: The exterior was a bit too crunchy. I've had chicken karage at some places that was more moist and juicy.
Food was ok but I was disappointed. Didn't seem to have enough flavor. The fried plantains were really good though they were probably the best thing we had. I was disappointed by the squid ink paella I've definitely had better at other places. The service was very good and the waiter was really accommodating.
I just ordered delivery and from this place for the first time and I have to say that not only was the delivery prompt but the food was tasty. I ordered their tuna sashimi, beef stick and a salmon cucumber roll. All yummy, fresh and satisfying. Well done Asea!
"Came here late night with a bunch of friends, and the bartender was exceptionally rude. Come to find out, he was rude to three other of my friends that night as well. When he asked me and my two other girlfriends what we would like to drink, (and we responded with water for now) he said ""why are you even here."" Not in a fun, silly manor, he was completely serious. He didn't come by, or look at us for the rest of the night. I found it extremely odd, and unprofessional. I will NOT be coming back here. Even if its a great place, I don't want to run the chance of him being my bartender again."
I treated out of town corporate guests to this eatery. The waiters were simply wonderful. Very attentive and ultra fabulous. My guests enjoyed their cuisine. I liked mine, but the only downer was that my pasta was stuck together in a mound. I only had a few free pieces of pasta to go with the fabulous seafood mix of shrimp and scallops.  I didn't want to complain in front of my guests and make the meal a downer. They could have done better with the pasta. I couldn't eat it. It was stuck together and would not come apart.  I'd go back, but I'd make sure that the pasta is correct next time. It is an Italian restaurant. If anything, the pasta should be on point.
"Decided to take an out of town guest out for a nice Italian meal, but that is certainly NOT what we got.  Our server, Morgan, was little more than a zombie with an apron on as she refused eye contact or even a smile.  Our food arrived, and the food runner placed the dishes in front of us...and that was the last we saw of anyone from Cent'Anni.  We all desperately wanted more parmesan for our tasteless pasta, but no one ever came to check on us.  We decided to make our way through the bland meals we were given, but my friends mom had to CUT her rigatoni with a knife.  Al dente is one thing, but these were not that.  We finally caught our servers (Morgan) attention, and politely explained that this dish was not really up to par, and she said back to us, 'let me speak to the chef about it.'  Moments later the manager comes over and says, ""I heard you didn't like your dinner - just so you know we cook the pasta al dente""  I let her know that I understood that, but the dish had no flavor whatsoever, and the pasta was well beyond al dente.   She then argued with us about boxing it up to go, and i told her repeatedly that too much time and lapsed and we needed to leave.   There was never an apology.  Never an attempt to retain us as guests.  When we paid for the other 2 dishes and our wine no one said thank you.  We passed Morgan on the way out and she was too involved with her cell phone to even thank us as we passed.   Don't waste your time.  They are NOT taking time out for their guests....so pick one of the many other delicious options on Franklin Ave that truly appreciates the business they are getting.  Also, Morgan:  A smile goes a long way."
The food was below average and over priced. The menu was not what is presented on the website. We had the fish at $30 a plate. The fish tasted frozen, the seasoning was bland, the the small portion of fish with three potatoes looked lost on the giant plate.  We had the apple crumble for desert with cinnamon ice cream. The apples were not cooked, no sauce, and that was definitely not cinanimon ice cream.
I have no words. Ippudo is HEAVEN and worth the wait. I've been here a few times now and would bathe in their ramen broth. Recommend the pork buns and the spicy ramen (karakamen). Go now, go often...
I came here with some friends to grab a bite to eat. A friend who has been here before recommended the place. The drink selection is great, I had some type of cider beer, with something in it,I don't drink beer so I couldn't tell you what is was, but it was good, my friend gave me a sample of her ginger beer, wasn't crazy about that, but like I said not really a beer drinker, thought I would try a beer since it is a bar, usually don't go to those either. Anyway they brought me a sample of the beer I wanted before I brought it so that was nice, then gave us free popcorn as a welcome gift I guess. It was good. We wanted to originally sit outside but they were closing up that area when we came so we went inside. It was pretty loud, but not crazy loud. A real low key sitting area is where we sat at. Then the food came. I order chicken and waffle sandwich, with garlic and parmesan fries, they were cold, the waffle was dry, the chicken was not crispy it was more a big dry patty of some sort, I had better at a diner. My friends order sliders, they said those were good, but could of been cook longer. (They forgot to tell them well done.) Their  fries was also cold or lukewarm, just ok. My friend who has been there before said the chicken wings she order was off, so they gave her a new batch that was better to her taste. Overall if needed be I would go back for the different varieties of their beer drinks, my food choice would be the sliders maybe try their onion rings instead. The service was good, the waiter was very attentive. The manager was pleasant to my friend about the chicken, but I think it's not a place I would want to return to. Like I said I'm not a beer drinker and I could get cocktails from another place that serves way better food, so I would pass if the choice is left up to me.
I hate....hate hate... to leave this review but... my Fiance & I were so underwhelmed.. we are seafood lovers...and found this spot on yelp while riding around in Bk.... Maybe our expecatations and bar was set too high??? The portions are small, the prices are high and the taste is just....OK... not bad.. but just OK.. The location is perfect for 'changing' BK the establishment is clean with a great vibe... I just wish the food was better.....:-(
Atrium is a great place for brunch! The chicken and waffles was some of the best I have ever had. Tip: MAKE A RESERVATION! It gets really crowded and you pretty much need a reservation to eat here for brunch. I was lucky enough last time I came to grab a seat at the counter downstairs; however, I would suggest making a reservation to be safe! The staff was very friendly, constantly checked in with us to make sure everything was okay, and were very attentive in refilling our waters and coffees.
Pretty solid food and reasonable prices. Best Malaysian restaurant!!...A must go-to place if you are ever in the Chinatown area! This was my 2nd time eating here. Came here around dinnertime with a friend and we ordered a roti canai (comes with curry dipping sauce), fried pearl noodles, and a pork dish. The Roti canal was soft and pretty crispy...reminds me of a tortilla and the sauce was a rich & creamy consistency. Quite delicious! I suggest getting that to start out! Felt like eating some kind of noodle dish and the fried pearl noodles were perfect..quite chewy! All of the dishes were quite tasty....we finished all our food and were content. Decided to order a coconut pudding at the end. I'm not a huge fan of just coconut alone, so I just had one bite to try it out and my friend ate the rest...said it was a nice dessert to end the meal.
My second time here and the food and service continue to be excellent.  Our waitress was wonderful and the maitre'd was warm and welcoming. My only complaint is about all the candles.  I don't remember all these candles the first time I came but if they are trying to create ambience, they've overdone it.  I certainly didn't appreciate the scent either. All I want to smell in a restaurant is good food.  Not candles.  I hope they rethink this idea as it really is unnecessary and actually detracts from the overall dining experience instead of enhancing it, in my opinion.  Except for this, we were very satisfied with everything.
Terrible. This was worse birthday dinner experience in NYC. I could deal with such a loud atmosphere and being unable to hear my husband. We were seated at upstairs small row. Setting was nice however service was just truly awful. First given salsa verde in a cup with ketchup all over. Never checked back and then said would do something. They did NOTHING and acted like we were the problem. We ordered 3 items and 40 minutes later NO ONE OUNCE OF FOOD!!! SERIOUSLY?? Then they said they would offer 10 percent off and didnt do that correctly. DONT DINE HERE!! Manager could not care less and was so insincere it was ridiculous!! Go to other location. Wasted my time and made my birthday dinner a mess!!!!
I had a birthday dinner reservation here last night, and my two friends and I arrived early. We decided to grab drinks at the bar while we waited for a table.  Five minutes till when we were supposed to sit down we saw some crazy activity in the kitchen! Something had triggered the sprinkler system to go off!! The cooks ran out of the kitchen, and I believe all the food that was being prepped was ruined. They said that they couldn't service us, which is pretty disappointing since it was a Friday night in New York City and we'd have the reservation for a while. No fault of the restaurants I don't think, but it was still a bummer. Overall, the restaurant was really cute. We had ordered some drinks at the bar and they were delicious. Hoping I can experience the food at Galli sometime soon and update this!!
From the time that we walked in the door, our experience was not what I expected.  It was loud and hard to hear and the hostess seemed super annoyed when asked pleasantly to repeat her directions. And so the evening began. Our waitress had zero personality or patience: she seemed almost annoyed when we asked questions about the menu. She told my friend that she couldn't bring us bread until we ordered. I wondered if she thought we would take the bread and run. Although she was very quick to see if we were ready to order dinner and dessert, she never checked to see how our meal was and if we needed anything. We had to bother the bus boys several times for things. When we asked for a second dessert menu, she told us that she couldn't spare it. She brought the check before we were done eating but she ignored us when we tried to pay....  The restaurant itself is nice although loud making it tough for good conversation. The garden is the best place to sit but reservations are only taken in advance for inside. The bathroom wasn't the cleanest and got worse as the evening progressed.   The food was good but not great. Some other little things bothered me as well. My friend got a glass of seltzer (fountain not bottled) and when she asked for a refill, the waitress told her she'd have to charge her again. We were surprised but recognized that it wasn't her fault. The glass however was absolutely tiny with almost all ice and they charged my friend $7. It wasn't about the money - we just thought it was ridiculous.    My advice: Go somewhere else.
We arrived on a busy Thursday night without reservations. The manager was able to fit us in between reservations but mentioned that the service would be quick since we only had an hour before the reserved guests would arrive. That was fine since we were in a hurry anyway. The waitress was pleasant and overall service was efficient.  The best part of the meal was the bread and olive oil dip which included lentils. I could have had that alone for dinner. The entrees were both dry.The orechiete pasta with broccoli rabe needed more olive oil. The cavatelli with wild boar ragu needed more sauce. There were chunks of meat but not enough sauce and I generally do not like pasta's drowning in sauce so this was definitely on the dry side. The restaurant is small and it's a tight crowded fit and could get noisy depending on the loudness of other groups.  Wines by the glass were very good. Overall I would like to go back and try other menu items. Prices are reasonable
At Cafe Habana, we had to wait for an hour before we were seated for a late lunch & we expected a lot from the place since it came with rave reviews. However, we were dismayed to find that the food was just so-so & the servers were unfriendly. We had the #CubanSandwich #SteakSalad #FrozenMargarita. The food was definitely not worth waiting outside for 1 hour & then being rushed out of there while we were eating. There were plenty of tourists at the cafe that day so the food might have become a victim of their own popularity. Not recommended.
More critical health violations as of 08/09/2017. This is absolutely unbelievable and criminal. How is this place allowed to be open after so many violations that should of gotten it shut down weeks ago. Stay away if you care about what you put in you or families stomach.
This ramen is not going to disappoint you. But like any good ramen place, be ready to pay for a lot for little portion and wait for a long time.  I don't know why but I think Saturday night 7:30pm seems to be a not so busy time. Friday nights are usually crazier. Try to go by yourself helps.  If you are eating by yourself, you will be seated in a long table. And because it is dark and loud, sometimes the service will be a bit slow.
Pies n Thighs has reaffirmed my love for Brooklyn.  Even though my tum tum was not well prepared for a Southern brunch, I couldn't resist this place.  We got here pretty early, about 10ish, and there was no wait at all.  The service was great, nice and quick with our food.  We shared the Chicken and Waffles (strawberries on the side)...and to help tame my grumpy stomach, a Renegade.   The food was delish and half a meal was just the right portion for me.  The chicken biscuit and mac n cheese looked fantastic, I would def wanna try those next time.
We've been wanting to brunch here for a couple of years but always decided last minute and couldn't successfully find a reservation during Sunday brunch. Until last week!  And now we totally understand the hype! It all starts off with a warm basket of muffins and bread with butter. Which are all delicious, especially the chocolate chip muffins :) The brunch menu has great options and something for everyone whether you're looking for something sweet or savory. And the sangria list is awesome, with tons of red and white flavors.  I had the pollo ranchero and my bf got the vaca frita. We both enjoyed our dishes!  Definitely a fun brunch and so worth it!
Hands down one of the best restaurants in FiDi! With its warm romantic ambiance coupled with friendly service and comfy seats, Felice takes the cake!  This place is what every other FiDi joint should strive for. We all know that this area is no man's land for partying and/or fun dining- It's simply a tourist pull and no bars or restaurants get much foot traffic on weekends, as all the working bees step up their game and up the streets.  Well, on Monday night, I decided to go greet my SO. He wasn't quite finished with work so we ended up getting to Felice around 6:30. It's on the corner across from Harry's Italian, and a part of a hotel. The restaurant has an open wall, and all that separates it from the hotel lobby is the difference in flooring. I loved the very cute and chic decor of this place- a wall of wine bottles and dimly lit tables, made for an excellent date night. I couldn't stop giggling- all the warmth that filled me from the friendly staff to the glowing candlelight, what could go wrong? We started out with a bottle of red. It's a wine bar so, just as expected, they had an extensive list of vini and specials were listed on the wall near the bar. For appetizer, we ordered formaggi - 3 cheeses, came with olives, dry toast, and honey. It complimented our wine quite well but the price wasn't justified. I ordered the mista salad. Great presentation and it hit the spot but it wasn't out of the ordinary. I will say that the buffalo mozzarella was exquisite! The mustard vinaigrette wasn't overpowering- loved it. My SO's chicken milanese was just grilled chicken with baby arugula+roasted tomatoes on top with a bit of balsamic glazing for a hint of flavor. The chicken was very good- perfect temperature that worked in colorful harmony with the bed of cold salad on top. While it wasn't mind blowing, for FiDi, I was heavily impressed. Let's suffice it to say, we left VERY SATISFIED and full! I'd love to come back here every now and then for an after hours glass of wine.
"We came here with a friend, a bona-fide barbecue aficionado and more or less meatatarian, who ordered the burnt ends, or ""meat candy"". He was totally impressed, noting that outside of Texas, this is about as good as BBQ gets. I wouldn't quite go that far, but I did enjoy my meal. My options were somewhat limited, as I generally don't eat red meat and they were out of the ribs, but the menu here is robust enough that I still had options. I chose the pulled pork sandwich. It was nice and tender, but I was hoping for a smokier flavor. Although the house-made BBQ sauce was excellent, adding an extra infusion of smoky flavor, I felt like I had to keep piling it on to really enjoy each bite. We also ordered two sides (one of which was free thanks to the check-in deal, yay!): The cornbread with the honey butter and the mac n cheese. The cornbread was good, and the honey butter was a different if super sweet addition to the bread. The mac n cheese was creamy and plenty edible, but it also was a bit bland. I also had the opportunity to try a beer I hadn't heard of before: the Moo Thunder Stout, a good, not overly sweet Porter from upstate NY. Our server was notable: attentive but not overbearing, and kind. And the bathrooms were clean! Butcher Bar has certainly earned some cred from BBQ fans (and not just my friend). I'll give it 3.5 stars, but because my experience didn't quite live up to the hype, gotta round down."
I really liked the ambiance and decor, and the service was also great. Unfortunately, the food was not so great.  Whenever I try a new Thai restaurant, I always order pad Thai. It's classic and yet, everybody makes it differently. It's my barometer on the food quality. It might be unfair to judge the entire restaurant based on one food item, but my pad Thai was quite...unusual. Pad Thai blends flavours of sweet, sour, salty, and spicy. Pad Thai at this place overwhelmingly has a strong sweet flavour. I guess some people still probably like this, but the balance was off for me.
BTW I just felt like updating b/c this place deserves all the credit. I went for dinner here not too long ago and let me just say it was one of the BEST dinners ever! Seriously try everything, everything is so scrumptious.
"Birthday 2017 calls for Shanghainese soup dumplings as comfort food with family.  Shanghai Asian Manor has been on my Yelp bookmark for an eternity and a celebratory event calls for a visit for brunch.   Tuesday morning no wait for a table, no rush to eat, no bill dumped onto your table to usher you out the door, and surely no sticky reside on the table upon being seated.

Har Gow 蝦餃 (haa1 gaau2) - 4 pcs; $4.50 Fresh and large shrimp embedded and the skin was not too thick. Shredded Pork Pickled Veggie Noodle Soup 雪菜肉絲麵 wo1 daan2 min5 ci4 ngau4 juk6 (xuě cài ròu sī miàn) $6 Shared among two which there were too much seaweed and insufficient vegetables.  The flat noodles was solid and the broth was not too induced to MSG.  A soup ladle is provided which signify an upscale restaurant setting as a serving spoon.

Nice place and ambiance but service is all right. No suggestions at all and my friend meal was not good he actually threw up in the restroom
This is a 3-in-1 place - taqueria（order and get food by the counter), a cafe with outside seatings and a hidden bar/brasserie.  To enter the hidden restaurant at the basement level, you would need to check in with the suit-clad host standing by a door next to the taqueria ordering counter.  After he checks that your name is on the list (through making a reservation), you will then go through another suit-clad guy who would open the door to the stairs going to the basement level restaurant.  You would then walk past a kitchen to get to the restaurant.  A hostess/host would greet you and someone would take you to the table.   The underground restaurant is really small, but it has a lounge/bar area.  Music is blasting at this place, so if you're taking someone on a date, that's probably not a good idea, as you literally have to yell at each other in order to be able to hear each other.   They have an extensive cocktail list, along with a wine and beer menu.   Cocktails are priced $13-$20.  Their food is on the more expensive side (which you would expect at a hidden restaurant/speakeasy kind of place) compared to the order-by-the counter taqueria upstairs.  We ordered the fish and pork tacos, they're both $12 and each order comes with 2 tacos.  Please note that the tacos are very small, if you're hungry, that's definitely not enough for an entree.  One more thing is that this place does not serve guacamole!!   There were 2 big groups dining at the basement restaurant that night, they seemed to be having fun celebrating special occasions.  So, if you wanted to go to a place where music is blasting and it's exclusive access for a big group to celebrate your birthday, this place would be fun.  Other than that, the food is mediocre.  After our meal, we were still hungry, so we ordered beef taco, pork taco and a corn on the cob upstairs.  The tacos upstairs seemed a little bit bigger than the tacos served by the underground restaurant and they're priced less.  However, I don't think they are that good. If I wanted good tacos, I would go to Los Tacos No. 1 in the Chelsea market where they have freshly made pico de gallo for you to top your tacos with, and the taco stuffing is flavorful.  Their Mexican corn on the cob was ok, but I had better ones I got at street fairs.   So overall, this place is overrated, the food is mediocre and the selection is limited.  The music played at the underground restaurant is too loud, so you can barely talk with people in your party unless you sit next to each other.  Their service is also not good at all.  The hostess greeting us that day (Saturday around 8pm) also had an attitude, maybe she was having a bad day.  If you wanted good Mexican food and good music, there're way more places NYC has to offer.  If you just wanted a hidden restaurant experience, you could get that from so many other hidden restaurants/ speakeasies in the city.
We order duck and shellfish, everything was delicious, but the best  was the service, the waiters and waitresses are so attentive and their recommendations are the best. Definitely, we are coming back.
The greatest impression left on me by Toloache was regarding its size, or lack of it. Yep, very small, very crowded, very loud.  We arrived 15 minutes early and were not seated, despite asking, despite the free tables, despite the bar area being so busy it was game of human Tetris just to stand there. We were encouraged to drink $15 margaritas while being shuffled back and forward to let others get by. Frustrating start.  Tables are very close together. Like, close enough to pick off your neighbors plate. I thought we were done with the cramming elbow to elbow thing? The guacamole gave this place its extra star - 3 types available, and the classic is guac at its creamy and tasty best.  Steak and queso tacos came with no queso and were just okay. Nothing to remember. The miso glazed black cod didn't taste of miso at all, and the fish was tragically over cooked.  In summary, unimpressive and uncomfortable. Pass.

We make use of the dataset provided by ``SemEval-2016 Task 4 on Sentiment Analysis on Twitter`` (http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task4/). We focus on the subtask A which is coined as **message polarity classification task**. In this task, given a tweet, we need to predict whether the tweet is of **positive, negative or neutral sentiment**. We have 6,000, 1,999 and 20,632 tweets in train set, validation set and test set respectively. We have already preprocessed (tokenization, removing URLs, mentions, hashtags and so on) the tweets and placed it under ``data/sentiment-twitter-2016-task4`` folder in three files as ``train.tsv``, ``dev.tsv`` and ``test.tsv``."

    "### Feature Extractor\n",
    "The training example is a **tweet**, which contains an ordered list of terms (e.g., words). We need to **vectorize** the tweet, that is, convert the tweet to a fixed-length vector to be fed as input to a ML model. We also call this vector as a **feature vector**. In this tutorial, we will utilize simple features based on **term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf)** to represent a tweet. In our case a *document* is a *tweet* and a *word* is a *term*. There are two functions:\n",
    "- tf: A function for **'term frequency'** (basically counts, i.e., how many times the term occurred in our document) \n",
    "- idf:  A function for **'inverse document frequency'** (the total number of documents divided by the number of documents in which the term occurred).\n",
    "\n",
    "Tf-idf of a tweet $d$ is a $|V|$ dimensional feature vector, where each component corresponds to a term $t$ in the vocabulary V whose size is $|V|$. Tf-idf is formulated as,\n",
    "\n",
    "tf-idf(d,t) $ = (1 + \\log f_{d,t}) * \\log(1 + \\frac{N}{n_t})$\n",
    "\n",
    "where,\n",
    "- $f_{d,t}$ corresponds to the raw frequency of the term $t$ in tweet $d$\n",
    "- $N$ corresponds to the number of tweets in train set\n",
    "- $n_t$ corresponds to the number of tweets in train set that has the term $t$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: There are variations of tf-idf, but here:\n",
    "- We take the log and **add one** to idf to avoid dividing by zero if the term never occurs in any document.\n",
    "- We also similarly add 1 and take the log of tf.\n",
    "Ultimately, we will let sklearn take care of [tf-idf construction](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, **high weight** in tfâ€“idf feature vector is attained by a **high term frequency (in the given tweet) and a low tweet frequency of the term in the whole collection of tweets**. Hence, the weights tend to filter out common terms.\n",

    "## Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will focus on **word embeddings (or vectors)** generated by a [word2vec model](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/). Specifically, we will focus on **continuous bag of words (CBOW)** model. At its core, word2vec relies on the hypothesis that words which occur in **similar contexts** (defined by a select set of words before and after the word in the sentences in which the target word appears) tend to have **similar meaning** and therefore must have similar embeddings. CBOW model learns word embedding (of a certain size called **embedding size** which is a hyperparameter) by setting up an auxiliary task. The auxiliary task is to predict the word (target) given the surrounding words of the target word in a sentence as input. We typically consider **window size** (another hyperparameter) words before and after the target word as surrounding words (or context).\n",
    "\n",
    "The model architecture of CBOW based word2vec model from the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/sl2_textclassification_neuralnets_cbow.png\" alt=\"word2vec\" title=\"CBOW model - Model Architecture\" width=\"250\" height=\"100\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, consider our corpus has only one sentence **\"I had so much fun in my semester break\"**. If the window size is set to 2, then the train data for CBOW model corresponding to the auxiliary classification task looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| example no. | train input | train label |\n",
    "| ----------------- | ----------- |-------------|\n",
    "| 1  | 'I', 'had', 'much', 'fun'   | 'so' |\n",
    "| 2  | 'had', 'so', 'fun', 'in' | 'much' |\n",
    "| 3  | 'so', 'much', 'in', 'my' | 'fun' |\n",
    "| 4  | 'much', 'fun', 'my', 'semester' | 'in' |\n",
    "| 5  | 'fun', 'in', 'semester', 'break' | 'my' |\n",
    "\n",
    "Our vocabulary has 9 words and CBOW model learns a word embedding for every word in the vocabulary. These word embeddings are typically stored in a giant matrix $W_{input} \\in 9\\times3$, that is **vocabulary size $\\times$ embedding size** (assuming embedding size is 3). Each row in this giant matrix corresponds to a unique word in the vocabulary. The feature vector for the train input is constructed by **averaging the word embeddings** corresponds to the tokens in the train input. For instance, the feature vector for the first training example is given by $\\frac{1}{4} ï¼ˆW_{(I,:)} + W_{(had,:)} + W_{(much,:)} + W_{(fun,:)}ï¼‰$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This input is fed to a classification layer to identify the target word. Note that the CBOW model does not have bias term in the affine transformation module (``nn.Linear``) corresponding to the classification layer in the neural networks model. The number of categories ($K$) in CBOW model is equivalent to the size of the vocabulary ($9$ in our case).\n",
    "\n",
    "The word embeddings are **intialized** with small numbers sampled randomly **from Gaussian distribution** before training. During training, the word embeddings are jointly learned along with the parameters of the classification layer to predict the target word well given the context. Once the training is done, the word embeddings can capture some semantic features of the word. Note that post training, we do not care for the auxiliary task, whose main goal is to induce meaningful word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommended reading for word embeddings: https://github.com/UBC-NLP/dlnlp2019/blob/master/slides/word2vec.pdf, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf and https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nlp/word_embeddings_tutorial.html\n",

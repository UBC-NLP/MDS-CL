    "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are essentially a special case of a normal feed forward network, instead of being \"densely\" connected (note you may see people refer to Feed Forward networks as \"dense layers\"), nodes in CNNs connect to a smaller set of nodes, defined by the \"filters size\" of the network. CNNs thus have a smaller local windows to look at data, but make up for it by generally using many additional filters, which might be able to learn different aspects of the data. These networks turn out to be extremely useful for processing images, audio, and anything with some sort of spatial properties to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out they can also be used for any sentence classification task. Words in a sentence it turns out have a sort of 1D spatial ordering, which means some classification tasks can benefit from this CNNs ability to operate over the length of the sequence. In addition, because of the sparsity of the connections, you end up being able to make much smaller networks that retain a great deal of power.\n",

    "## Part 1: Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "``Regularization`` refers to techniques you can apply to machine learning algorithms to counteract the impact of ``overfitting``. One way to do this is by giving a penalty to model parameters. There are a number of different ways to do this but we'll mainly be looking at the two main types of regularization, *L1* and *L2* regularization, as well as a technique called *dropout* which is a neural-network specific style of regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "An important concept you need to be aware of is that of ``model capacity``. While there are theoretical definitions of what model capacity is, you can generally think of it as the number of hypotheses (hypothesis space) a model can select. In deep learning, we can increase model capacity by increasing for example (1) ``depth``, by adding more hidden layers and (2) ``width``, by adding more nodes to the network hidden layers. A higher capacity model can fit very complex functions (find complicated solutions). Note: ``*Higher capacity models are more prone to overfitting, while lower capacity models can underfit*``.\n",
    "\n",
    "### L2 Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular regularization technique in machine learning, L2 regularization, puts some penalty on model features based on the squared weights of these features, calculated using the L2-norm:  $\\frac{\\lambda}{2}||w||_2^2=\\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\sum_i |w_i|^2$. The amount of regularization we apply to our model is a *hyperparameter* value indicated by $ \\lambda$, some positive value (e.g., $0.001$) that will need to be optmized.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of using a squared penalty on the value of the weights is to discourage models that have very large values for any particular weights, this in turn means that it's less likely to overfit to the particular patterns (features that has such highest features) it has seen in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only major downside occurs in situations where your data has lots of *extraneous* features, in the case where you may have lots of garbage features mixed in with your data (much greater than the number of features that are useful for your problem) it may still try to use these features, leading to suboptimal results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using L2 Regularization in Pytorch\n",
    "\n",
    "In Pytorch L2 regularization is implemented through the inclusion *weight decay*, the name Pytorch uses to refer to ``L2 penalty``. Typically, when you set the value of ``weight_decay`` to be $>0$, L2 regularization will be used by the model. The following is an example of setting the value of ``weight_decay``: [Note we haven't declared a model yet, we'll run these things together at the end]"

    "### When to use L2 Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking L2 regularization is going to almost always help reduce overfitting in your problems. L2 regularization is also a popular method especially outside deep learning. For deep learning, ``dropout`` (introduced later) is currently a more popular approach to regularization and it does work well. You can also combine both L2 regularization and ``dropout``, although you don't usually need to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The one area where L2 regularization might not quite be good enough, is as mentioned above, when you have really noisy data that includes a lot of irrelevant features. Instead, you might want to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "### L1 Regularization\n",
    "\n",
    "*L1 regularization* functions similarly to L2 regularization, except it gives a linear penalty to the model weights using the L1 norm:  $\\lambda ||w||_1 = \\lambda \\sum_i |w_i|$. The immediate upside of L1 regularization is that it can ignore extraneous features. By giving equal emphasis to all weight values, it will spend as much time trying to decrease the size of small weights as big weights, to the extent that it can shrink weight values to 0! Essentially this allows your model to perform automatic feature selection, getting rid of features that don't help (at least as much) solve the problem and leaving you with sparse weight matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a wonderful side effect of having the sparse matrices, this can (1) spead up training (due to less computations) and (2) decrease memory needed for storing your model. In addition, (3) L1-selected features (i.e., those not set to ``zero`` are ones that you can view as *relevant* and hence you can use them for ``interpretability`` (i.e., as a way to interpret why your model makes the decision it makes). This is important as a way to *see through* our models and help explain them, including to the general public. Increasingly, this is becoming more important over time as AI and its applications become more pervasive in our lives. \n",

Dropout also has some really interesting properties when it comes to training, we'll look at this later in the tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, using dropout means that you are actually training several networks, rather then a single network, and somewhat using an ensemble of these networks to predict. This is particulary useful since it `forces` your model to distribute its dependence to more nodes by preventing ``co-adaptation`` between only particular nodes. In spite of its simplicity, ``dropout`` is elegant and effective (as stated earlier).\n",
